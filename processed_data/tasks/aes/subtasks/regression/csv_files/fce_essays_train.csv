151," Dear Sir During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show. It was a very unpleasent evening. First of all, it had read on the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring at this show. But someone else participated instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing. The second problem was the start of the show. It began at 20:15 and not at 19:30! That's almost an hour later. I had read that there would be available some discounts, but I became none of them. The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out, but it was closed because of the hour the show finished. It wasn't a perfect evening at all. I hope you can understand my disappointment and   ask for my money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  In our days, nobody can live without technology. My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The timer of my radio wakes me up at half past six. I stand up, go  the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave. After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always reach late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to make compositions, to print some pictures or to surf on the internet. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends per  telephone. Without these technology I would get realy bored. Now, I loose less of time and can use the technology to enjoy myself. ",25
396," To whome it may concern, I am writing to tell  that I had a very disappointing evening regarding a musical show at your theatre. There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out. Firstly, the advertisement told that Danny Brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out  a completely different person which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper. Secondly, according to the advertisment, the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 which caused me a trouble. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said so in the advertisement, however, it was not actually available which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant which was recommended in the advertisement, however, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation which I thought was very unprofessional. With all the dissatisfuction above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it would have to be. I hope that you will consider this letter seriously and try to improve your service. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How did we know that she was that kind of person? Well, it all begun when Pat's friend, Molly, went down to London... Molly went down to London for  shopping and as she was walking  the street. She found  familier faces on the other side of the street. It was Vance and Sally whom she had not seen for ages. Pat, too, are  friend of them and has seen them  time to time. Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they have been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their own time . After Molly went back home in Aberdeen, she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London. Then suddenly, Pat's face turned to look confused and  said in a small voice, 'Haven't they broken up  long time ago? Sally must have a new boy friend'. As Molly didn't know this, she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it. Then, Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept as a secret but it just came out of her mouth! She didn't mean to do so, but this kind of thing happens a lot. Now Pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because Molly isn't good at keeping secrets either! Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and the Poor Vance is always the last person to know it.  ",32
893," Dear Helen Ryan. I am writing to reply  your letter about my first prize in your competition and give you all  information for my two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I  prefer travelling in July, because it will be my school vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during school times. It'd be great if I could be accommodated in  tents, because I've never slept in  tents before, and I think it is an interesting experience. Secondly, the two activities wich I'd like to pratice during the campsite are sailing and surfing. I have already surfed when I was travelling in Brazil, but since them I have hadn't a chance to do it again. Although I know how surfing, I have no idea about sailing, I just only read about it and I am very interested  to practice. Is there any problem? I'd like to ask you some questions: Is  necessary bring  money to the Camp? How much? And about clothes? What is more appropiated? Finally, I want to thank you for the great opportunity I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely. Camila Beatriz de J. Branco  [SEP]  A programme  not often good. Shopping is said that an enjoyable programme in all situations. However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be. When you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant. The problem is find a shop assistant who hear  your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times  isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash. So you had lost hours to buy nothing. You can't talk to  manager even to give him suggestions  to improve his business, because he is always absent. And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you. To conclude, although you can have good moments while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, isn't it? ",29
788," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I'm writting to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that Camp. I'm going to give you all the information you need from me. I only can travel I July, because it is when I stop playing basketball to rest before starting the new season. I don't mind staying wherever you want me to. However, I prefer log cabins to tents. They're more comfortable. According to the activities I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal  me much, but I'm quite good at Golf. I like surfing and playing tennis,  such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it. there'are no more questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writting to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday. It was such a beautiful night! Unforgetable. I had always dreamt of being near ""The Cranberies"", but I had never thought that the dream could became reallity. During the afternoon, Tim and me spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held. AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there for starting queueing. We bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest. After a few minutes the dream happened: Kare - the guitarrist - appeared over there. At first we both thought we were dreaming but when we realised it was true we went there and ask him some questions. And then we bring his guitar for him. It was great to help him. Finally he said how thankful he was and alowed us to stay with them till the concert started. That's all. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Aladdin ",30
428," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show advertised in your latest leaflet. First of all, I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen and it disappointed me very much. Although your advertisement stated that the main actor would be Danny Brook, it was not him and a different man  was not prepared for the role. Secondly, you advertisement stated that the second show should start at 19:30. It was not true because the audience had to wait until 20:15. Then, I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket, although I am not  adult yet. Finally, I was hungry after waiting for the show and wanted to order something to eat. It was, however, impossible because the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons. I would like you then to send the money back to me because I did not enjoy the show at all and the ticket costed a fortune. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She heard from her friend Jon that Paul, the worst pupil at school, had thrown an enormous frog inside the desk of Miss Colston, their English teacher. Miss Colston was an old woman, who wanted her pupils to understand and admire English novels and poems. But the children were bored during her lessons and Paul was very disappointed that she didn't read any funny stories. So he decided to scare the old woman away from school. Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it, as he was the best friend of Pat. ""Oh, that girl will cause some problems"" - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom. She approached the desk and wanted to open it, but suddenly Pat shouted - ""Miss Colston, please, don't do that. There's a frog"". The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - ""Who did it?"" ""Oh, God"" - thought Paul - ""the next time I will throw a frog inside Pat's rucksack."" ",40
510," Dear Mr or Madam, I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play ""over the rainbow"" which is performing at  Circle Theatre. First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage, during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour  fifteen  past after. We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from the promise written in the advertisement. Defineteley, I want my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told  everything about Lynne Harter, our new collegue at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, it was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely agressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth, I continued: ""You can't believe it Pat, she wears trousers like  men and green flowery blouses"" Of course, my friend and I were laughing during half an hour. Two days after, when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told  everything about Ann1. In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well,  unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets. ",29
229," Dear Mr Smith, I'm terribly sorry but I would notice you about a very disappointing evening. I'm sure you'll read this letter, with the intention of explaining the problems  had during the musical show of his theatre. One of the causes of my disappointing was the different actor that played  the show. I like very much Danny Brook, and his unaspected absence caused on me a big sadness. Then,  musical show had to start at 19,30..why at 20:15 there was also the light on? You'll be agree with me that 45 minutes to waiting for the starting of the show is a too long time. The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and  open restaurant after the show but it wasn't in this way. The restaurant was closed 'cause of illness.. of who? It's  strange thing! For those reasons I ask you for some money back, sure of my good reasons. Greetings  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It's for this reason that now I'm in this terrible situation. I can't believe she said that, I was at the Maria's party and 'cause of my distraction, I said Pat that I had lost the Jon's shirt. I was agree to buy another one, of the same style, but now he's angry with me, 'cause I didn't say anything to him. I don't know how to do. He's my best friend and so he wanted from me all the truth I can give him. It's all right, but I also think that he's too exagerate. I don't think  of having done  a so bad thing  to broke our friendness. I feel sad and shocked. I like his company, and we are happy when we are togheter. I can't finished  'cause of a girl that can't keeping a simple secret. ",20
492," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice. The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show. The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were suposed to be the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad. Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but finally it started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of others people time. Another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students, but no their weren't any. Also after the show your restaurant was closed because their wasn't enough staff. To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point. In that case I also want to ask you for my money back. I think you will understand that and   looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully T. Herschel  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly. We can't imagine to live without it anymore because we are so dependent of it. It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock, than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating. Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat. If we than want to go to work we don't have to get our horse, no, we get the car keys and go where ever we want to. At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology, the computer. Without that we can't do anything today. So in the last century our daily life changed dramandesly and we became lazy and our life unpersonal, fast and unromantic. Noone can think about a life without commuters or electricity. But we can't say the new technology has done just bad things in our life because otherwise we couldn't have made such progress in all the sciences and other subjects ",31
165," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you in order to complain for the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; concretely on Friday evening. First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion about your company, which is said to be the best exhibitor of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended  the referred day to your theatre with the aim of having a perfect evening. However, nothing was further from what really happened. In the beginning, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started. And finally, when it went on, we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing. I hope you realise this was totally different from what you advertised, and I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future offering me some money back. Yours faithfully, Jaro Santoquez  [SEP]  Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in. Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily life had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished looking  how our lifes are changing frenetically. We have hardly assimilated a new technology when it is replaced or modified by another. Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily life more comfortable and easier, but does it means that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free-time. However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stopping race. Machines do now most of  hard work, but this does not mean that we are working less. People spend more and more time working, searching for new inventions that will make life easier, but then fail to profit  all the obtained benefits. ",33
1211," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter about the internation student conference. The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car. It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total  members of your group are 4 and  taxi fare would not be expensive. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel. Regarding the end-of-conference party on Thursday, it starts at 7 p.m. in the garden of the college. You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy-dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign. On Friday afternoon, it has set to be a free time. Therefore, you can go shopping in the town centre which is near the college. Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there. The other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy. Moreover, it is the biggest flower market in this area. I look forward to meeting you soon and hope you have a safe journey. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Invented Light There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight, moonlight, candle light. Some of them are natural whereas the others are not. Owing to  increasing demand of light for more activities, the natural source is not adequate. There, electric light has invented. Nowadays, the electric light has been becoming part of our lives, especially during the night. Whatever we do at night, we need the electric light. Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light? It must have been a big impact on industry, agriculture and our lifestyle. Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit. Do you feel uncomfortable? Could you do anything much without light? In addition, the electric light is the manuscript of other electric equipments and they has become an important part of our life, too. I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for comforting our lifestyle. ",30
937," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan: I've recived your letter and I'm very happy to know that I won the competition and the first prize. In answer to your questions, I will have to say that I just can go to the campament on July because of my job, they only gave me that month free. In the camp I would like to stay in  log cabins because I hate to sleep uncomfortable and, I will if I stay in a tent. Acording to your letter, you asked me to choose two of your activities. I  prefere to do some climbing because that's what I do in my spare time and I do it quite well. Apart from that, if you give surfing classes I would love to take them; surfing is one of my chilhood drems that I never came true. I have a few questions that you might be able to answer me. I don't know what tipe of clothes do I have to take and the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you please could help me  giving me this information I would be very pleased. Im looking forward to go to the camp and hearing from you soon Yours sincerely Carmen Garcia.  [SEP]  Shooping is not always enjoyable. We all have been shooping once in our lifes and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we had a class discussion and we all agree in some points. For example if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were looking for, and instead of buing what we came for we will go out with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be  waste of time. Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then is where the problems begin. Most of the times one get lost, or they start plaing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get on a bad mood and you'll have a bad shooping day. So if you want to have a good relaxing shooping day, we recommend you not to go with your little brothers and to go with enogh time to look arround for what you really want. ",26
1048," It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it I knew, I would not come  this world again, everyone has only one change to do whatever they want I come from  very ruler family. You had never made on your  own decision, you always had to ask your family's opinion. I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I was saving my pocket money to go to the theatre  age  15. During the this years I had met with Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning while I was going to school. Despite of  going to school by bus  easier than riding  bycyle I had prefered to going to school by bycyle to  by bus. In that way I had been able to see her every morning. The more seeing her I could, the more ambitious I became. At last I met wit her. She had invited me  her play to the theatre. When I went to her play to see, I  realy would love to be a actress. She was the only person who encourage me to be a actress. I had had a exam for  being theatre players without saying my family. Otherwise my father could kill me and not let me to go to school. I would never ever go to school again. Despite of the preparing  the exams, I had been continue  to my school regularly. Now I am a theatre actress. It was my dream I wish my dady ",7
346," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writting  you about an enjure that I had in your last musical  Circle Theatre. I went to see ""Over the rainbow"" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening. First of all, I was surpprising that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not played. Anybody told us why they wasn't there. I read on your advertisment in Friday's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the representation started at 20.15. I was waitting 45 minutes for anything! I am  studiant and I didn't find any discount's ticket. I don't understand the problem between your advertisment and the reality. And finally, after the show, I wanted to drink a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed! Like mentioned in the newspaper I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Your sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? My life change everyday with the modern technology. For exemple, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I am going on  Internet and ask for what I need. The day after I get everything at home by post. In my point of vue,  Internet is the most important discover of the 2000 centery. You can book tickets for  theatre, sport, etc., you can find all  informations you need for yourself. You have a lot of things to do, to see, to learn. It is too big to tell everybody about what you can do! I use  all the time Internet for my homework and in the futur, I hope, I will be able to use it for my own work. Technology will not stop to grow up and help people in the futur. I hope I will help them, I am sure I will! ",25

Then we thought about going for swimming to discuss about some things. The second new was that he had found a job for the summer. He would go to work in a café. He would earn a lot of money, in addition they wanted an another person. As a result I had a work too. We had the greatest day. Then we had an idea! We would have much money from the work.

For me it is only possible to go to the USA in July. The reason for this is that I have to work in August and from September to June I have to go to school. I would prefer  long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me. The activities you offer are really interesting. I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera. Unfortunately, I do not have an own camera. In spite of this, I have got all  equipement I need for the activity painting and I am painting very well. Could you please tell me if I will need some extra money for the two activities.

First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position. It was really hard work. At one o'clock I had a break. At this time I promised  that I would never do this awful job again. The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it. In the afternoon I was sitting around, waiting for the pop groups. Then at five o'clock my favourite band ""Tristania"" arrived. I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later. In the end I was happy that I had done this job. It was really a wonderful day. I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together the next year. Give my regards to your family.

I had to (lyd) tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn. The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for  throat. Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels, I mean, dried towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh; don't ask me why. The pop concert happened in a big stadium called ""Mararcanã"". I just did not enjoyed  when they were making the instruments work for the big day. But what I particularly liked was see and ask  autographs from the rest of the others groups. Don't be jealous, I will make a copy for you, OK? Love ",24

I didn't expect to win the first prize in your competition, I am very happy. It was always my dream to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Now it's become a reality. If I can choose the period, I would like to travel only in July because in other months I have a lot of thing to do. As accommnodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in  log cabins because I think it is safier than in a tent. I've red that I will have a chance to do two extra activities while I will be at Camp. I think it would be a good idea to practise my photography, because I'm not so good a photographer and I would like to learn swimming as I can't do it. Taking part in these two activities would be very useful for me. There is another thing I would  know, what kind of clothes have I bring with me? And how much money can I take with me? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely -  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. This is true. Some days ago my class had a big discussion about shopping. In that occasion I hadn't the opportunity for giving my opinion about this task. Now, my English teacher has asked me to explane all what I think. In my opinion, nowdays, shopping is very easy and in the same time very hard. It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy, shops are plenty of every kinds of things. You can chose the price more suitable for you. Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me. Shopping is not enjoyable when you have not enough money to buy what you want, or when you are not sure about what you would like to buy. I remember very well two people who thought very different about shopping. My grandmother thought that shopping was a terrible thing, she hadn't enough money to buy even the bread. My mother, whereas was very keen on shopping  everything. ",28
915," Dear Helen RYAN, I'm the winner of the first prize in your competion and I'm writing to you to give  some information which was required for you. Your first question was about when I'd like to travel. Well, it's only possible in July because of the University's holiday (during the rest of the year I'm attending to the classes). If I can choose  accommodation I  prefer  log cabins, because when I've been in Camps , it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation. It's really difficult choose two activities from that list. Everyone are very interesting. Anyway, I think Basketball could be the right  because it's the sport that I'm practising from I was a child and photography because it's my hobby on my free time, I'm really enjoy it and I can say I'm so good in it. I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals, Are they provided? or can we find some places to buy it? I suppose it's everything that you need from me. Any other question don't hesitate to ask me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. I think shopping is a subject really up to date. I can say that nowadays  is growing up very quickly in our society like a kind of sport or hobby to waste or spend the free time. And it's creating a lot of adict people, call ""shopalcoholics"". Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for, perhaps because it is not  your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms waiting stand up for your turn. After that,  the unfriendly and sometime's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down. But never mind! the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit  because your feet are killing you and  realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.

131," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show, which I have seen in your theatre, in London during my holiday. According to the advertisement, which appeared in one of the London's newspapers, I would like to present you  some of my complaines about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you ""offered"" has been changed. The man who played the main male role was different than this one, who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start has been changed, making your show delayed for nearlly one hour! In your offer I noticed an information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another ""defect"" in the advertisement was an ""invitation"" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown for me reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information telling about a cause of closing it). Finally, you guaranteed ""a perfect evening out"", but for me it was the worst visit in  theatre in two years time. To sum up, I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre. Neither  beautiful surranding near your theatre nor  comfortable sits will not recompansate  my horrible evening. Therefore, I would like you to send my money back, because I think I deserve it as a viewer. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology is very important in our life. Mainly, because it makes it easier and more comfortable. Nevertheless it has some advantages and drawbacks. In my opinion my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet her ""at every corner"": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my life-style for  better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done,  washing machine which makes my clothes clean again. Recently, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers,  internet, super-fast cars etc. These improvements helps me with my ordinary dutes. I can do my homework on  computer, prepare for the class test by searching  information in  Internet and use a mobile phone every time when I want to connect with one of my parents. However, technology has a bad influence on us, generally on our healf. Couple of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones make a possibility of getting sick with cancer. Also fast and well-improved car increase a risk of pollution of our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents. In conclusion I think that modern technology makes our life easier, nevertheless, we should avoid any possible risks connected with these improvements. Then we will be able to say that technology is something we should be proud of. ",29
572," At the begining I would like to thank you. Now I am going to give you some further informations I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in High school and this is  most important year of my life I am studying to  university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then by the end of June I will be having  university entrance exam  after that in July I am going to be alright. I would prefer  tents because I have never stay in  tents before and I am wondering how it is going to be like And among these activities I am choosing basketball and swimming. Basketball because I am very good at it, swimming because I like to swim very much but I'm not a very good swimmer. And finally I would like to ask you some questions. My first question is about clothes; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us? and How much money do we need to take? Finally what kind of wheather is waiting for us? Thank you for Every thing Your sincerely Osman ",13
560," To Whom It May Concern, I'd like to say thank you for choosing me and sending me the letter. I am extremely excited about the camp! For the camp, you need some information from me, don't you? Therefore I am going to write them down. First, I'd like to travel on July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible. Second, I prefer log cabins than tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents. Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities. Because I've started surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing. Also, painting is one of my favorite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint. Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions. I know everything is included and I don't need to pay anything but in case should I bring some money or not? And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount? Also, could you suggest me what kind of clothes I should bring, please? Thank you very much for reading this letter. I really appreciate your choosing me. I am really looking forward  this camp. Thank you. Truly, Yoshiko Murasaki  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Anyway, I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I'd like to write them down! First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I was hired! Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our heart was bumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do so we started working. After working 30 minute, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully! Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusands of funs came in this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert. During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved. Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteres as well. It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you were there with us! Maybe next time! By the way, I think I should go. Please take care and please write to me, right? Love, Yoshiko. ",36
1039," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised. All  students are very pleased and we are looking forward to go to London. We know we are going for  three days, but we'll have enough time to use one of the bigger city in the world. London is the place to be when  always something happening. We  all very happy with your programme, especially we like the idea of  sightseeing by our and  National Art Gallery. The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show,  we would like to ask you if  is possible to make some changes in the programme? The show is on Tuesday the 14th between 10.00-  13.00. We think  is the great opportunity to see  latest fashion,  find  about make up and hairstyles. And all of it is free, According to your programme we have the science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping. Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then  for the shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday? All  students will be very greatful . your sincerly  [SEP]  I think for all of us home is something which is a very important. Home sweet home. We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome. Anyway home is always the place to go because  is ours we feel save and comfortable . Home sweet home. After hard work we want to go home to have our corner where we are all able to rest and relax. I think in the future home might be just the place to go to sleep. We live in the very busy world! Working long hours, doing plenty of activieties, going out, going on holidays. We even don't spend time with  families. Propably in the future we might be to busy to go to our own home and spend some time there. But in the end of the day it alway will be  place to go! We find our family there and our life. Some of us have been living in  one house since they were born. We are sentimental and we have memory from the past. I think it's a part of our life.lf ",29
683," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to give you further information about the two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to express my joy for having won that prize. I am very happy. Secondly, you would like to know when I will be able to go there. Actually, I have asked my boss and he gave me two weeks  in July. We have a lot to do at work so it is not easy to have weeks off. Thirdly, I prefer staying in a tent than staying in a log cabin. I think it is more fun. Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing. I am very good at tennis. Last year, I took part in a competition and I did it well. I have also a licence for sailing but I have not done it for a long time. I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me. I do not know if things are expensive there. Therefore, could you give me an idea of how much money I should bring with me. I am looking forwards to receiving more information. Yours sincerely, Sofia Jordana  [SEP]  It is Saturday. The car park of the supermarket is full. No more trolleys for shopping. All the shops are crowded. Some people are in a hurry other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed. It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults. We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell. In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable especially when there is too many people in there. ",33
1112," Dear Mr. Robertson, The trip that you planned for us, students, it's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London. Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events. We'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated with our school and the students that study there. It's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions. But there's something that I'd like to ask. The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday. It's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions, of the new hairstyles,  of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to  make up. Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon. By this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion . Thanks for the attention and we're waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous People x  Media Famous people are special for the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information. The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people. It's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect . Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer . In summary, the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems. The respect is essential. They deserve to have a private life like any common person. ",27
275," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Last week, I was on holiday in London, and reading the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (like it is said) ""a perfect evening out"". But  it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct at all, or I must have been to the wrong show! According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing! The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing. I was a little hungry after the show, but then again, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information . In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.. But I found out afterwards and it was too late. Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with her: she could do anything to have friends, even betray me. No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. ""He's travelling around the world"" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But  know Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man. Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same. Everyone, even my friends, looked at me in a strange kind of way. As if I was guilty. What did I have to do with this? I wasn't the one who had killed the man, but it seemed people didn't want to talk to me anymore. I knew, now, why I wanted to hide the truth. ",32
894," Dear Helen, I have received your letter this morning and I'm very happy for this first prize. It's a great opportunity for me participate in your Camp California because normaly I work a lot and I can't spend money to travel, moreover, I have to maintain my big family because I'm married and I have three children. I would like to travel in July because before  I have to work with my father because he's ill. For de accommodation I  prefer a long cabin because it's more comfortable. I recognise that I would like to sleep in a tent but in this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed. I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time. I have to choose painting and the photography therefore. I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think in my helth. In your letter you explain me that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life in Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money. The weather I hope will be good so I suppose I have to bring short clothes. I'm very enthousiastic and I attend your answer as soon is possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In our society the money is one of the most important aspect to have power. If we thing about , we will realise that we need money all the day. Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of the activities. There are a lot of people who spend a lot of money because they like shopping. Sometimes, they have to buy something that they need but frequently, they buy  only to spend money. This is a big problem because a lot of families haven't money, however spend going shopping. We have to teach to our children the value of the money, to explain the difficulties  to earn money in a job, because we have to work eight, nine or ten hours a day, for example. It's a first step to educate the youngest and to help our society. The money is important but we have to know how to spend it: shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24
366," Dear Sir/Madam The Circle Theatre manager I am writing to complain about your product. I would like you to back my money because that was not same as your advertisement. I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement. In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time, price discount and equipment. DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actor so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my apointment on that day at 18=30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me. However, when I went to the theatre, you didn't anything not only discount but also apporogize  us for  dalay of starting  musical. In addition  different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner about the musical because the restrant had been closed. It made me so dissapoint and angry. You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He always tried to say nothing and did. But everyone always noticed he had  secrets from his face. Whenever he has  secrets, his nose moves quickly. He had not liked this habit and had thought it was wrost of him until he solved a big crime. When all  money had gone from a bank, nobady  there except Pat. Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him. So. Pat didn't say anything. But his nose moved quickly when  police showed  a picture of  bank robbers. Then  police realized who were bank robbers and arested them. Although  bank robbers complained to Pat, he said nothing to anybody. He just moved his nose!! Thanks to his habit, he is still alive and all  money were backed to the bank. The town became peace again. ",19
37," Dear Mr Jane Clark I am writeing to you to ""help"" you with your festival next year, last year wasn't very good so maybe we can make it more atracite this year? the first  I think we shoul rent biger hall for that so we could make  better sound and give more space for  viewers! If we will make one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events we can make intrestede more people. We can inaute stars and artists from around the world who will make and prisentspresent all kind of music like jazz, rock, classical ect. It should be done show so people can see how people in every corner of the word make theyr own fun. Art exhibitions is  good idea too, to introdus how the music is making and show how the instruments lode. Afterward we could let people talk with  artists so they can get knoe theyr privacy. Mr. Jane if you want get more of my suggestions and opinions about it pleace contact with me on my calle phone  Sincirley  [SEP]  Dear Simona! Thank you for your letter it was so nice to hear from you gain and I am glad you have meant this subject. It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules then Polish schools but may be we might find sth incomon?!  What rules do we have in our schools? The first of all it dipends what kind of school it is? Primary, highschool or university! I think that now Polish schools are going foward but they still have lots of bad habits. Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have less pracite lessons,  sometimes it's hard to get a books or other neaded things  to study.  Conneat between students and their teachers or principals is very poor! During the lesson we are not allowed to have food or stg drink,  we can't be late to school School  supose to be our second home but it's not we work hard and for the end  our education we still have nothing. You asking me what would I change? I would make schools more unstressfull,  added fun cause it's easeyer  way to learn and I would gives students more chances to share yo with their fantazy at school. Maybe  Polish system is not bad, but it's conftyble too. I know that that letter will not change anything but you can see how compliated is  Polish studen's life Your   ",20
990," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing to you in order to collect further information about my trip to Camp California and to make some things a bit more clear for you. Firstly, since I'll be very busy during the next three months due to my job's demands, I would like to travel in July. Although the weather may not be friendly, it is the only time I have to see the beauty of the camp. I'll choose to stay in  tents, considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way. And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child, these will be the activities I'll like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things! I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which  will be necessary for me to take. I'm looking forward to joining you in July and hoping for this trip to be an amazing experience. Yours sincerely Pablo Picasso  [SEP]  Shopping can be painful As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink. It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts. Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains. Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces. ",36
881," Dear Miss Hellen Ryan: I am really happy to get such wonderful news from you. In order to  the prize, I would like to travel, if it is possible, on July because I am a student and my winter brake is taking place during this month, July. I would prepare to stay in a cabin because I have not got really good experiences in camping in tents, last time a bear came inside while I was in . I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp, by the way my team and I won the last scholl championship, I play guard on my team, I also like tennis but I am not very good, I was wondering if you could give me some lesson while I am there. I do not have words to express how happy I am, I would like to thanks you and Camp California for this oportunity. Hoping to hear soon from you. Raul Pedro Ybarra S  [SEP]  Since the man become man he has had the need of hunting for sourvive, in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the wemon's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff. Nowadays in the year 2000 we still practice this ancient art but in a diferent way, we don't use weapons for hunting animal in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more we go shopping. This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have develop such an instinc for shopping that we can proudly say, that we are some sort of kings in the urban jungle. If an activity has stay with us, the mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price mark on it, that is the greatest  extasis. But where is the bad poet of it, well shopping can became horrible in christmast for example when houndred of people goes to the shopping center and it also can take many problems when you become an impulsive buyer. Any ways shopping is with us and it will stay with us for a long time. ",26
1142," Dear Mrs Brown, I am writing  you because my class want to give a surprise birthday party for your husband Mr Brown. We need your help for the details. First of all could you let us know if the date of June 16th is all right with his timetable program. We have organised to do the party between three to six o'clock in  afternoon in  College Canteen, about  food we organised a buffet, but could you also help us with the music which he prefer, if  prefer something especialy. We have invite the student, the teachers and the Principal of  school but we appreciate  if you are coming. At last would you tell us which is the best present for him a compact disk or a book. We want say thanks again for your help and you must be sure that your opinion it would be valuable to us. I am looking forward to receiving your answer and don't forget that it is a surprice birthday party. Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Family life in our days is very important because both of parents work and they haven't any time for  children. In addition childrens have so much lessons at school that they doesn't have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are in home. In spide  that fact there are of course many families especialy in small towns which eat lunch all together and they they solve their problem all together. Parents play with  children and have fun. And the difference in that  children is effectivily when they grown up and want to make a family they do the same with their parents and make a happy family. Besides that the most importand  is that this children have an easy teenaties and they haven't go pshycological problems and they are useful in sociaty. To sum up family life is the most important think for childrens phycological wold which help them in their education, job and their married in future. So we also try to make our time creative when we are with our children. ",22
764," Dear Mrs. Ryan. I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize. It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July. I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is  for going with my parents to France. This has been scheduled 3 months ago. About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents. While I'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball, as I have been playing both sports all my life, and I have to say that I am very good at both. There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp. I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes. I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me. I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes  is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like. The Sports Shop. You cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is allways what we want. That's men's intention. Another point is to go  a big area. Specially  week-ends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to take a license to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out. In conclusion, for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all. ",32
642," Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to you to give  some requiered information. First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition. I am happy to visit the United States under your organisation. Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in  log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge  to stay in  tents for 2 weeks. Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join . Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. As you can see, I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not  beginners anymore. Moreover, could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should take with me? What kind of money is used? I am looking forward to going on holidays. Yours sincerely, Mr Oliver Herre  [SEP]  Brighton, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Excuse me that I didn't write you sooner. As you know, I was fairly busy with my studying for my First Certificate. The concert was absolute marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job. Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact  and access to all the famous Pop Stars. I had to bring them refreshments. That has been my dream since my childhood. I was a little bit disappointed about their attitude. They didn't really appreciate my service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience. Whatever, if you ever will have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked to see their way of life. I hope you will write  me very soon and I hope you know more about my concert experience in the backstage area. Lots of love, ",31
245," Dear Manager: When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very exited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving, it becomed the best oportunity I ever had to asist to a musical of that category, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writting to you. Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not , which was very disappointing because, the actors were starring  the musical, was one of it mayor attractions. Another point that I want to comply about, is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy, and  not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats. In consequence of the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important  to me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best. Hope to hear from you:  [SEP]  Science and Technology is a theme very  discussed nowdays, most of the comunity of our city, and of the world, were technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life. And I think it's the same to me, because when advances in technology like computers, internet, etc. were made, it changed my life as a high school student. Answering the question: ""How has modern technology changed my daily life?, I can confirm, that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the internet, because it was easiest to me, and to every one, to make your home works, school works, and in fact, it was easier to me to search for information that in the past I would have to look at in a library. But not all about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, had become computer's an thechnologic's slaves, and we can not do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make easier our daily tasks, but we have to mantain our independence as humans. Technology, in fact it has made an improvement on daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brain will become atrophied. ",23
1183," Dear Mrs M. Smith, I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested. First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel, 82 Regent Street, so that it is very easy to reach the conference. In fact you can take the bus number 3; as you can see, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel, then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass, on your right hand. Secondly, we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge. I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age. What is more, I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie. Finally, if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours. However, if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square. I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Have you ever thought  to live without your car? How can you manage your daily life without it? I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car. It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted. On the other hand, this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy. In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring  lugguage and shopping bags. Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey. For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with. However, I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic. On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly. That's why I couldn't image my life without it. ",31
221," Matthias Hähnel 104 Mühlenstrasse 09111 Chemnik Germany The manager of the Circle Theatre Dear manager, During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the advertisment you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain  the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how it was told in the advertisment. It was also told that the evening shows are starting  19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also because I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisment. I hope you will answer my letter and correct the problems in your theatre. Yours faithfully Adolf Schmidt  [SEP]  At first you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology'. For me modern technology are things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, Hifi sound systems, television or even cars. But are they are usefull in every situation and everywhere? My oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same problem with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I  got  Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use  his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots. We should also move our body and not only use our brain. ",35
1179," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference. Next week I will be start organising some events for this conference. The event will organize at the Palace Hotel. The same hotel that will you stay . Palace Hotel is opposite the park `Clifton', which is near the college. We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we don't need to use a transport. Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to  hotel I think that  is better  to come all the group in  college and then we can go all together to the `Palace Hotel'. The conference start at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before. Concerning the end-of-conference  I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. Tell me your idea. About the clothes that we need to wear,  must be  uniform, because  is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges. Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing-crossing around London. You will have the opportunity  visiting some museums and  zoo parks. I think it is a nice idea. If you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047***. Please if you have  more ideas send me a letter. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowdays all the people have a telephone. Telephone is part of our life. It is one of the most important investigation all over the world. Telephone is  type of communication. If you want to talk with your friends, parents, partner or to ask something, you can call them without wondering how  can be communicate with them. Especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and everyday and you don't feel that they are far a way from you. Today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone. They are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line. Also you can leave a message if you call and can't find someone. The last type of telephone, is the mobile phone. You can use it everywhere and at anytime. Finally  telephone except|apart from   type of communication, is  type and socialisation. Nowadays who are so bussy and we don't have free time to see our friends,  we can call them and talk or chat with them. Especial the young people are using many hours  the telephone and that is trouble for their parents. Telephone is  very important investigation  if we can use it correct without use it as  type of entertaiment as they are doing nowadys many people. ",19
429," Dear Sir or Madame, I am writing to you to complate about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at your theatre ""The Circle Theatre"". I am deeply disapointed with the service and the unrealiable notice, at your theartre. I've attened your shown on one of the evening, during my stay in London. In your advertisement you've mention ""Danny Brook"" would be starring and as it turned out it was a different Danny Brook. I am very disapointed by this. You also mention that your show would starts at 19.30 but to my knowleage it started at 20:15 and that is fourty-five minutes of waiting. It also mention other services would be availalde to the adicne. For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant were closed after the show, when it was mean to be open after the show acording to the advertisement but  was closed dure to the delay of the preformane. Lastly your advertisement mention clearly that this would be ""Your perfect evening out!"" but sadly it was a real waste of time for me. And I would like a refun, You have wasted my evening and money. I hope to hear from you soon. Your faithfully, (Rumgopol Rinsook).  [SEP]  For the past 100 year, fashion has change a great deal. Now a day clothes is designed to be more comfortable. You can just ""pop down the road"" and go shopping. Material and coloures of your cloths has changed since the early 1900's to 2000. Synethetic was created by scientis. Clothes are now mass producted and desing by desingers. Desingres are unique in the way but their desings are some times more, a pirce of art and not for realistic perposoe. It is hard to imageine what people would were in 100 years time, because since the 1900's clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle. May be it would contine reduceing in 100 years to come. Scinetis might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde. It could be that you would carry a small round box. It would provide you with a new type of material to cover you body and you can chosse what you want to wear by pressing bottons. This would be very easy to mantage but that  mean no  shopping for girls. It would be scarly to live in the new 100 years, but it would be interesting to see what will happen. Hopefully it wouldn't be verybody walking around neaked. ",28
1219," Dear Marie, I am sorry to hear that our friend Mr Brown is ill. As our conference is due to start next week I respond straight away. There are some informations you have asked me about. We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel. That is the best option because it is placed less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center. When you live a hotel you have to turn right and you bloun the street. At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building. That's our Conference Center. At the hotel reception you will find printed information  how to get over there. As you know at the end-of-conference there is a party. Party is due to start at 8 p.m  until 3 a.m. There is  2hr break between  end-of-conference and  party. At this time you and your group can refresh yourself. I would like to mention that because  our conference that is dress-code party. Hope you will enjoy it. We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and  hot or cold buffet. About you're the last question I can sugest to visit the Royal Castle. That will give you and your guests an impression about our country and history. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  In our town there is so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one. In my opinion the most interesting is the Castle. It is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it. Just look up and you will see that huge building. Actually it is a whole complex, the Old and the New Castle,  Cathedrall and the most interesting undergroud part with it's amazing crypts. And if you climb on the top of the main tower - the keep  you will see unforgetable view on a white toun. After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle. You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon, armores and, we are especially pround of it, the great collection of swords. After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle . I am sure that should be enought for  one day trip. For you information I can say that at this time we have  five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display. That should complete that amazing day. ",25
536," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to thank  for noticing me about the competition and I would be very grateful in giving to you the information  was requiered in your letter. I regret to inform you that I have had some problems in my full-time sales assistant job so, I would rather travel only in July than other months. About the Accommodation I would like you to take careful consideration  that I am ashmatic so, I would appreciatte it if you could reserve a bed in  log cabins. Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can involve through the camping. I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourites ones. I have recently finished a three year course of painting and I always be fascinated by the photography. On the other hand, I would also like to know some about further details like wether we need to bring we us some clothes or  it will be provided to us and if we need some money in case we have to afford something. I hope to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi. How do you do? You may be asking why I haven't written to you before. Well, I've been very busy you know. Two weeks ago I enrolled in a group to help on building a stage for a concert of a famous singer star. Activities lasting almost 2 days and a half. The first day we have to move to the airport to bring all the equipment by lorries to the camp. It was really awful and hard. I finished the day too tired. However, the second day was less heavier than the first one. We just worked in building the stage and all those of thing. Putting the instrument in the right place, testing all the microphone as well as the sound was the rest of the job. At the end I must confess that it was really amazing hang up and down all the equipment which varied from small microphone to a marvellous huge large black screen of TV. If you had this oportunitty one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like  just to get a free pass. My regards to your family. Write  me soon. ",26
1047," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing to you, in the name of all the students in my class, to tell you about our wish to change the London's programme. I would also like to thank you for the good programme you made for us,  especially the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating. I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is going to take place at the ""Central Exibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown in this occasion. We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes part only once a year and, on top of all , it is free for students. We suggest to go to the show on Tuesday afternoon instead of going shopping (thing that we can do on Wednesday afternoon, in our free time). I hope you will consider our request yours sincerely  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had absolutely no choice. We had walked for three hours (my mother, my two brother and I) through the humid and noisy jungle, looking forward to reach a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family, old friends of us, used to live. The path we were walking in was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There were nor  bridge nor a canoe, the only way to cross it was  walking on an old big  trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only connection between our side and the other. My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear. Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I took all my courage,  a big deep breath, and crossed it! It was easier than I had thought!. That day, I learnt that I can do even things which, at first sight, seem impossible to be done. ",33
779," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to enquire about the competition that I won and give some details to you about myself and my interests. In the first place, I prefer to travel on July because my school will not be closed before this date. Secondly, a tent holiday is always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members in  swimming-school team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is a good fun. Because of these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which  were given. I would like to know what types of clothes I need and beside this, how much money I need during my vacation. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's ages since I've heard from you. I hope you and your family are well. Last month, I had a great time at the concert of ""Dragon"" which is the most popular hard-rock group all over the world. They had a concert in my hometown that's why the organizators were looking for young people who can speak English. I applied and They took me on. I took part in the security department. The staff in that departnent are really friendly and helpful and they are also huge like giants. Basicly, I helped them connecting with the local police and getting some electronical equipments that they needed. They treated me as if I was the private secretary of the department, because of this sometimes I felt that the power was in my hands. By the way, I have already been invited  their next concernt. They gave me two free tickets. Would you like to come with me? Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",29
936," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan. It was so great to hear that I had won first prize. It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp. I am writing to reply about your questions. I am wondering that I will be only able to travel in July, because I have to finish my first year at the university. It finishes 29th of June. In addition to this, I have already resistered  another course which starts from 2nd of August. Secondly, I would prefer living in tents, I always admire outdoors life. Finally, I would like to  surging and golf. In  case of surfing, I have never had an experience, I am  absolutely beginner. On the other hand, I used to play golf with my father. When I was 14, I won the competition. I would like to ask about Camp California. Let me know if I have to take which kind of clothes and how much money I need. It would be very helpful. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Hi. How are you? I am fine. Thanks for your letter. I want to let you know about my experience as you wanted. Well, last month, I worked at a pop concert. It was fantastic because I could see Madonna. My main job was to tide up her dressing room. Can you imagine? You are working with your idea woman, I can't still belive that I spoke with her. Anyway, the most important thing was that I had  good experience. If we had worked together we would have had a good time. It's   pity, isn't it? Now, I know how difficult  to sing in front of the audience and behind the start there are a lot of the people who help the performance. Next time, I hope that we'll work together. Let's find some information to get a job. Shall we? I have to go now. I am fed up with studying, but I have to. I hope that you'll be alright. I am looking forward to hearing from you. With lots of love, ",24
690," 13 June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, According to your letter, I am writing to infrom you about the information you need to know for my trip two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have freetime in July   at any day, any week, because I am still having my lesson at college and it will be finished at the end of June and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love  atmosephere of camping, but I wouldn't mind to stay in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to have swimming and Basketball. I have always found these kind of activity make me fell strong and  enjoy doing it. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing it up till now. I also used to be in a basketball team in school for 3 years. One thing, I would like to know is how many clothes I have to take with me and what kind of cloth they are? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vanida Montri  [SEP]  Report on daily life at school Introduction The aim of this report is describ and assess  lesson and activities should be filmed in a short video. It is base on information made availble by student from each class at school. Lessons Most student who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part of the lesson  to be on film. It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because student always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner, in spite of having told from  teacher ten times. It felt to be a good memory to be remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way. This lesson will give us to be relaxed and have  laugh. We also would like to have a history on. Activities Going out to visit the history town every weekend seem to be the most enjoyable activity for student. Spending time together out of the class is the nice experiance. Having a sport after class it also fun. Conclusion Lesson and activities, which most student suggested are very interesting and it is not seem to be boring for the student. ",24
1069," Dear Mr. Robertson: I'm writing  you representing all the english class in order to let you know how exciting we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interresting on doing in London while we're there. First of all, we'd like to thank you for the programme you all ready arrange it's wonderful, because it covers most of our interrests. But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure show that will be held at the Central kExhibition hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00. So we suggest to put it this way on Tuesday 14, in the morning go to the Science Museum and instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion show, because  will be the latest fashion, leisure  and sports wear, make up, and hair styles, and as you know us, we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are  London. Thank you for your time, and We're looking forward to hearing from your opion. faithfully yours  [SEP]  IT WAS DANGEROUS, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT ...BECAUSE Since always I'd gotten the idea of travel abroad and experiece others people's life and cultures, so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university. I arrived in Paris for New Years Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a little amount of money. But eventhough all of these desadventages above, I was folling my dreams and objectives and inspite of everything I was going to do it. So suddenly, a week later I found me a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke french at that moment. It took me three months to overcame the languages and after this time the whole familly falled in love with me,  that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the familly, eventhough It was very hard at the beggining.

746," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I was so suprise to hear from you. I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize on the competition. I'm so happy because it is the first time that I win something. Here it is all your information. I would like  if you could to have my vacation trip on July because  is the only time of the year that my job could let me have a vacation. As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it is my first time that I'm going to camping and I would like to see how the real life is. I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities also. I would like to choose swimming and the climbing. I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing that's why I choose it because I want to try something knew. At last I would like to ask you about my clothes and how the weather is going to be and what kind of clothes I must to take with me. That is all. Thank you for making my dream come true Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Everyone has likes and dislikes. But noone is doing what he likes all the time. There is times that you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times that you are doing what you like but not  the time you  like it. What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time. First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy to shop all the time. Nothing in life is always enjoyable  even the things we enjoy to do, and that's how life is. You say you enjoy shopping I understand but life goes on you can't do the same things every day. live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun. You don't have to be bored with the same old things. Because as I said to do what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have  long time to do something the you enjoy it more. ",25
650," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now, I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written on it. First of all, I would like to travel only in the month of July, because during the month of June, I'm going to work and in September I have to study a lot, because school will start . Speaking about accommodation, between tents and log cabins, I woul prefer  tents, because I love the adventure and also because I can be freer. I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have choosen two from your list: Basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been taking part in a strong team for three years. The other one I have choosen is swimming; for the same reason why I chose Basketball. But, what about clothes, money, food? I hope you will take my answers into consideration. Thank you for now. Yours faithfuly Simone Pausini  [SEP]  Many people ""see"" at shopping like an amusement, but I think it's not always a good translation to give it. In my opinion to do shopping is often funny, above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shop. For exemple, if the shop is full of people,  is not enjoyable, because they will create too  confusion, too  noise with the risk of leaving time. Shopping is a funny thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have  free time and when you can relax yourself. Another thing that regardes  me, is that I enjoy my self more when I know I have to do shopping for me than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!! ",24
579," Dear Mrs H. Ryan I am writing with reference to your letter and I would like to give  some information which I have been asked . Because my course finishes at the end of June and I am going to work for a Hotel in August and September, I would like to travel in July. It is the best time for me. As far as accommodation is concern, I would like to say that I prefer to stay in tents. I like staying in tents because when we go on holiday with my friends, we always stay in tents, so I am used to staying in tents. Moreover, I have also been asked to choose some activities. I would like to choose basketball and swimming. When I was at school, I have been playing for the school team and I am good at swimming. Finally, could you let me know what sort of clothes would be better to bring. It would also be useful to know that how much money will be enough to bring. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: Mr. J. Y  Head Teacher From: Re: Short Video About Daily Life at I.S.O. School. FINDINGS I have discussed with my friends and school teachers about this subject. Here are some information about daily life at I.S.O. Morning Lessons: Although there are a lot of classes, there is  special FCE class in which students are being prepared for  FCE exam. There are special methods and materials for students. Afternoon Lessons: The aim of the afternoon lessons is to be able to give ability in speaking. There are some discussion groups, so students may have  discussion on any subject. Break Time: We have a lot of facilities for break time. These are computer, video, and sports. RECOMMONDATIONS In my opinion we should choose break time activities. Because there are a lot of activities which students take part in. It would be much better for video film. ",29
528," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given. Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him. Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show. It began 45 minutes later than it should have been. Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket, it occuried to be impossible to have one. Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff. All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, T. Gens  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone. It was far too heavy to keep it for myself. So I made a mistake and I told her. The day after, at school, I noticed that everyone was looking at me. I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat. She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes. From this moment, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know  it sooner or later. It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse. I tried to take it on my stride but I couldn't. I was terrified. My fear turned out to be right. I read the hurt in her eyes. She knew. She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it. ",38
214," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"". I was very disappointed because the actors wasn't Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Instead of them you had different actors. Then the show delayed, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30. I had to wait 45 minutes! Another point is that the discounts wasn't available although I could red  it before at your notice. After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but as I arrived in the restaurant it had been closed. But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the resaurant after the show. I can't understand such kind of mistakes. You wrote also that the evening would be perfect. For me it wasn't and because of that I ask you to give me my money back. If you can't give me all the money back then do it particularly. I  give you my phone number, you can reach me from 8 o'clock till 12 o'clock: 08532143251 Please call me back soon. Yours faithfully Carolina Schwitt  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all I do is becoming more comfortable. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search  something like a telefonnumber or an adress I also look it up from the internet. I use also the internet when I need any informations for example  I need them for school or private for myself. A few years ago I had to go in a library and look it up in many books. Most that took a long time. I think the advantage of modern technology is that all I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbys or for friends. Another important point for me is that things like listening  music or watching TV sounds better and the pictures on TV are being impoved, because the machines become more better. And also a good intention for me is the Handy, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people. ",24
542," Dear Sir. Thank you very much for informing me  I've won the prize. To let you arrange the details of your programe, I'm going to give my answers to you. Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already resistered  another summer course which starts in the end of July. Sorry about that but I can make that travel only in July. About accomodation, I prefer in tents to log cabins. Because I haven't used tents for ages so this time, I want to have tents for 2 weeks which will remind me of my childhood with my family. I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in  Sates. I might have lots of chances to take photos of beautiful nature. So I'm longing to take part in that activity, photography. Actually I've been in  amature photographer's organization for 3 years. And I'd like to choose swimming as the other one. I learned swimming at my age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming. At that time, I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strocks. Finally, could you let me know how the weather is like in July in  States? Then I can prepare my clothes suitable for that weather. And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation. Thanks loads Yours sincerely Kyon Chwa  [SEP]  All the students in my class are excited about that work and now we're in the process of discussion about what will be filmed. Some students suggested very brilliant ideas. We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time. The lessons we have in the morning doesn't attract us very much, but this bit will show you  routine scenery of a lesson. Spoken English lessons which is in the afternoon are quite interesting. Every  students keep talking about he theme and give their opinions. So we're going to organize about 10 minutes' short debate just for this video, but we haven't decided when it will be and the subject. After the class is also  very essential part of school life. Because we go to the pub which is situated near to the school quite often and we talk more about personal stories that make us closer, the pub after the lessons will be interesting. If you don't mind, we want to film  teachers' room as well. Your preperation for lessons, everyday chats and so on. If you allow us to film those things, we'll be very happy. When things become more obvious and more things are decided, I'll report again. ",31
365," Dear Sir or Madam, Last week I spent my holiday in London and I've seen your musical ""Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed. When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems. The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15. The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none. Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of  holiday. Why do you give those information in an advertisment. For me it was really not a perfect evening, I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible. Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for a compensation, maybe to get my money back. I hope you understand my complains. I wish you answer me soon. Yours sincerely Sandra Eichmann  [SEP]  In my opinion the modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play   computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine. I grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the  development in the technology is not very big. Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet. It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything. You don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food. I can just switch on my computer and order everything. I also don't write letters anymore because I write e-mails to my friends. That goes quicker and it is easier for me. But I think in my generation it is not a really big difference. In comparison to my grandparents they have really problems to accept these changes in modern technology. Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years. ",30
1129," Dear Mr Robertson. It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thanks  for organising a school trip to London. We have seen the programme list and we all think it will be enjoyable. Especially to the science museum because we  all doing science in school. Recently, some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London. it will be on the 14th and we all want to go. So, it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show. This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show And it is free for students. it will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show. So could you give us permission to go? We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed. We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon. So we can do shopping instead. Then, we can go to the show during that period We are all looking forward for you answer. faithful 12-12-00  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Because there was a man  had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him. Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes. I was thinking 'what should I do?' I haven't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home. At that time he was unconcious, I kept asking myself 'should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him. I was struggling because I knew if I didn't help him, he would die in a short time. I decided to do something to this man, my first move was to check  was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe. And  checking his body condition. After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars. I ran back home for help. I phoned to  police And told  the whole story. The strange thing happened to me, when I got back to that man. The car and the man were not there anymore. Where could they be? I was wondering. Oh, sorry they were not in this road, they were in the next road. ",29
731," Dear Ms. Ryan I am writing in response to the letter, which I had yesterday. I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give   details, which you would like to know. First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only on July. Because I have to work all year except one month holiday on July. Secondly, I would be appreciate  if I could stay in log cabins at Camp. I feel that it would be fabulos places with  western design. Most of all, I am really interested in doing two activities. I am very good at Tennis. However, I haven't had any idea about sailing. So, I would like to try both of them. Lastly, I would be grateful if I could have  following informations. I would like to know about  clothes, which are suitable for activities. As well as that, I wonder if I have to take some money for extra activities and  few more things. Thank you for  time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you. yours sincerely Jae Hwa. Kim.  [SEP]  There was a meeting to talk about a video about daily life at our school. It was thought that a normal, regular lesson, 3 optional lessons and a great deal of activities should be filmed. Refering to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming. I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn. There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting,  photography should be included. It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school. As well as that, if we filmed famous students and teachers in our school, it would be a fantastic video. In my opinion, students can learn English from wide activities as well as lessons. That's why they prefer to film a lot of activities. ",30
1028," Dear Mr Robertson In the name of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a galery. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. It is a famous exhibition, where are showed  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life. It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country. Could it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping time and to replace them by the London Show? We may go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of  the afternoon  free time. I hope you will consider my request. I'am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  My dream It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks. I lived in a small village on the ocean. My father was a captain on a huge boat. When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbours to harbours. I grew up through the water world and I couldn't live whitout it. Once I was fishing, when sharks came all around me. I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them. Since this famous experience, I dreamt every night about that. One Saturday I got on my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks. I had done what I had never expected to do. Now I can die in freedom. ",28
615," Dear Helen Ryan; Thank you very much for your letter and for this competition. First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available on July, is it fine for you? Because, the only time I can take  holiday is July. I would prefer log cabins, I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents. About the two activities I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming courses for four years. And the reason I choose painting is it's being very exciting to me, I am not very good at this subject but I would improve my painting. I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities? Do you reccomend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well? Is it  very expensive area? I mean would £700 be enough for me for one week? Thank you very much for your interest I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's been a long time not to write to you, I'm really sorry but I was very busy. I worked untill midnight everyday. Actually I don't work, you know, I had been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert. It was very important for us because we really wanted people to enjoy it. It was very enjoyable I met lots of friends We'd been together all day, painting the walls, cleaning  putting  some baloons and other staff everywhere. And at the time of  concert we wore a big funny costume, and danced with people. Everybody liked it very much, Anyway we worked for that. The most I like was meeting with the band. Guess what the name of the band is; Back Street Boys. Oh, my God they're so nice, talkative, funny, people. But you know they're a bit spoilt. I have to finish or I'll miss the last post. Bye for now, write to me soon love, ",31
1081," 12th December 2000 Dear Mister Robertson, The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm, which you have organised for our trip to London. The reason why I'm writting to you is the class and I have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 am - 19.00 p.m. It is a show about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all are interested in fashions and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for as because students have not to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour. I would like to suggest  you how the programm could be changed. Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wedensday afternoon in our free time. What are you thinking about this suggesten? I hope you will unterstand this kind of matter and the class and I  looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot. First point  we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or  internet. In the future they both getting closer and closer. That means for exampel while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or chees. Or never living the office you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath. So in fact people's home became more confienence and comfortabler. I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furnitures of people's home will not change as well. ",21
232," To: the manager of The Circle Theatre From: Subject: complaint Dear Sir or Madam, I was at the show of your theatre three days ago. Unfortunately, my expectations have not been realized because of  many problems I had during the show. First of all, there was another actor instead of Danny Brook (as it was written in the advertisement). Secondly, the show was delayed and started at 20.15 so I had to wait 45 minutes doing absolutely nothing and wasting my time. No discounts were given and, what is more, your theatre restaurant was closed all the time. I was not able to have a dinner after the show. On the whole, I was very disappointed  having left the Circle Theatre. All the impressions were destroyed by many problems. I ask you for returning my money back. Or I will have nothing to do except for going to the court. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Three hundred years ago fashion changed up one time in each hundred years. One hundred years ago it was one time in 50-25 years. And now we have to change some of our clothes every 6 months because they are not so fashionable any more. Fashion is one of the most important parts of our image and everyday life now. Fashion is becoming more useful, all the new inventions and technologies are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future. It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now. With no doubt, the influence of modern technologies will be great. Future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable, we can see the progress in the fashion even now. It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year of 2050. So all the fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable. What will we have? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning. ",27
856," Dear Miss Helen Ryan, I am writting to reply  your letter and comenicate my aceptance of the first prize in your Competition. This summer, I am available on July because on Agust my family and I are going to go to Canada and on September I will go back at university. If there is no chance to go to California on July, I could wait untill next summer. About accommodation, I would like to  a long cabin because last year I had an accident and my back is enjure, so sleeping in a tent it would be painful for me. I play basketball at university and my level is quite good but  I am really enjoying is being a referee. Due to my back enjure, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit, it would be a good aidea to be a referee. I would like to swim everyday if  is able. Althoung swimming is so bored, it would be a good  help for curing my back. Could you please let me know where will I eate? if will there be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it? how many money  you think will I need for those two weeks? And please could you give me  details about how does the weather  like there and what type the clothes will I have to bringh? Looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerily  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was brilliant! I had the best month in my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard, I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys with funny people. My job was cleaning the ground after the concert; ""it was very dirty"". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course, I had not to pay for getting in. I felt in love with a beautiful girl ""Calen"", she is from Spain and was selling ""hot dogs"". She will come to Liverpool next week and I'll put her up. Probably she'll come with a friend  if you want you can enjoy us. Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've done a new friends and I know that in the concert there isn't any drunk just funny and wonderful people. I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help in ""Doctor Meesee"" that is the best concert in the world, I hope you will come there. You have to save up  money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..). Love ",29
162," Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spent the hole  last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" was (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city. But from the beginning we found a lot of problems. Despite we are actors we had to pay  a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you  the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show. I am waiting  your answer,  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life. Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic. Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space. Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of  Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays, and send my work to the office everyday. ",35

972," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in you competition. I am writing in order to give you all the details that you need from me. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I think California is better in Summer. Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because cabins seem to be more comfortable than tents. According to your letter, I will be able to take part in two activities at the Camp. Let me tell you that I would like to sing and play tennis. As a matter of fact, I am very good at both of them. Finally, I would like you to tell me if I will need some special clothes. If the answer is yes, could you tell me which kind of clothes I will need. One other thing, it would be useful to know if I will need to take with me some extra money. If the answer is yes, could you tell me how much money I will need to take with me. I look forward to receiving you reply. Yours sincerely, DENIS JIMENEZ  [SEP]  Introduction This report is to suggest which lessons and activities should be filmed in order to make the video about daily life at school. Lessons and Activities suggested Lessons attended in the language laboratory. Special lessons attended in the library. Students using the computer and video room Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings, sing along parties and indoor games. Ordinary lessons attended by students from different levels . By filming... Lessons and activities which take place in the language laboratory, in the library and in the computer and video room, we can also show the school's facilities and how students take advantage of them. Ordinary lessons, it is a good way of showing the relationship between students and teachers. Activities connected with the social programme, we can show how students make the most of their time at school when they are not attending their ordinary lessons or using the facilities. Conclusion I would recommend the lessons and activities mentioned above in order to make the video in question. ",40
580," Camp California in the U.S.A. Competition Organiser 13th June 2000 DEAR Helen Ryan, I am really happy for receive your congratulations. Was  very exciting moment and  very nice competition. And now to be the first winner. Is wonderful for me to have the opportunitie to visit the Camp California in the U.S.A. In answer at your letter. I would like to travel in July for two reason one's is because I totaly will finish my exam in that date and the other   in the first two week  I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and will be there the delegation from my country. And for the second question. About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp I would prefer  log cabins; because maybe  is more interesting to share with other people. In other hand you ask me I have the chance for to choose two activities while I am at the camp. but  is no easy, because all is very interesting for me. But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for practice climbing and surfing. Meanwhile, these activities are develop. Can you said me if  is necessary to bring  special clothes, I refer for instance if I practice surfing  I need  water suit. Is  possible to get  there? At the same situation for climbing  I need  special equipment and then there are  available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities?  I need  extra money? I am really appreciate  if you can answer me these doubt and saying again. Thanks very much, because is new stimulation for me. this prize. Yours sincerely, Isabel Cruz  [SEP]  13th June, 2000 Shopping is not always enjoyable. I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view, because we can studie the  reaction before, during and after to shopping. People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary. We must to accept that  media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V. For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes, cosmetic, accesories, jewels etc. And the other  they choose sometimes just for the label. Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area, because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they  shopping they choose pre-prepared food. We know  is more easy for these  busy life. In the other hand the facilities for access to  mall center is not good. The area for parking, space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate. Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable. I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment. which is special place in the town we  lefet just for  comerical area, but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket, and mall centre in different areas of the city.

11,"  Ms Clark, I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival. Last season I spent two days at the Festival. I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better. First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can know artists who cames from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last edition there were artists who cames from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa. Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small, and because of it I couldn't see one of the concerts in  programme. In my opinion, one of the best things of the last Festival was that there were not only concerts . I saw films and I played ping-pong. In the next edition will  be more or less ? I hope more. The thing that I liked much more than others, was that I had to buy only one ticket for all  events, and it was no pricey. It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you, I think you should do a baby-parking, in fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sons. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I like read very much, because every book that I read shows me a different world. What I try to explain is that in every book there are characters or situations  really different. So we can read realistic stories or fantastic , it depends from what we prefer. I always prefer read books that are inusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity of escape from the everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without doubts, Wuthering Heights a famous book written by Emily Brontë. The attention of the  is focused on the unfortunate love of Heatcliff and Catherine. They are the main characters of that book, and what caracterize them is the violence of their passions. In this book you can find only good or bad characters, everything is good or bad. If you look at this book like a painting you can't see afumature of colours, you see only primary colours. In other words, when I read a book I want to go in a world where I can find something different from my everyday life. ",28
471," 17 June, 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I visited your theatre a couple of days ago in order to see the musical show titled 'Over The Rainbow'. I was not satified with the show at all because it was very different from the information your advertisement had stated. First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation . Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner. I had planned to have dinner there after the show. What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time during my holiday in London. I do hope you will understand my feelings and send some money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had known that but I told my secret to her, which was a big mistake. It was just an usual day. Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin. Pat was very surprised but soon she began asking me lots of questions about him. I didn't mind telling her about my cousin, actually he isn't different from other boys at all, he just has sweet-looking. Next day, I went to school as usual and got agog at a large number of girls waiting for me around my rocker. They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend. Now I'm asking my cousin either to meet my friends, or to quit being a singer right now. ",33
958," 13 of June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan: I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permition from my work. At the same time, on july is my birthday, so it would be nice to celebrated  there. I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent, couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girl. Sleeping in  tent is much more exiting and clousy than  a log cabin. At the camp I will like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing, I love painting, in the university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby. So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp. The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice, so maybe I could get it better. I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires. Thankeaw for givin me this oportunity. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: You are never going to believe what I did last month I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when sudently a man stop us saying that he was looking for people to help in a concert and they was going to pay us five pounds an hour. We sed yes inmidiatly, I nearly shouted of happines when they told us that, Luis Miguel was doing the concert, he is my favorite singer. The concert was on a sunday and we had to work on the back of the stadge, doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people that was working there. We was so close to him, I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind, I will never forget that day. Since then, me and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day. I hop you write  me soon to tall me youre opinion. lots of love ",25
67," 16.12.2000 Dear Jane Clark, I went to the ""International Arts Festival"" on 21-22 November. The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for the next year's festival. Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries. I suggest you to increase this number for the next year. By this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will point on is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year?  Last thing that I will say is ""one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"". It was  very good idea. I hope you will make the same thing next year. These are the my suggestions. I hope you will listen  my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year in the festival.  Sincerely  [SEP]  16.12.2000 Dear Emily, I'm glad to see your letter. I'm fine thanks and my parents are also good. How are you and your parent? I' hope they are both well. I have a suprise for you. I will go to  this summer. May be we can meet there... You asked some questions about  rules in school and homes Let me answer this question. In schools we aren't allowed to speak in classes. Also we must go to school by our uniforms. However we are allowed to eat,  drink during the breaks. All the time we must be kind to our friends and teachers. We mustn't forget the books for the classes. These are the rules in school. In our home there are some rules too! I must be in home untill 11pm. I am not allowed to listen  high volume music at home. I must be kind to my brother and my parents. When the guests come to our home, I must be clear. Other things are allowed to me. I want to change  school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want.  Other rules are O.K. I want to hear some rules from you. Next time write the letter quick! I don't want to wait another 2 months. I'm waiting for your next letter. Take care and be careful not to break any rules. Your friend ",25
1096," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for organizing this trip to London, and for taking care of the programme. It is a very good shedule, especially because you have considered different activities for us. However, we saw an advertisement, and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will take place on Tuesday March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall, from 10.00 to 19.00. Personally, I think it can be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attent to, and we are all fond of the latest fashion. We noticed that it is free for students so the price of the trip will not rise. We discussed about the programme, and because the show will take the whole day, we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wenesday instead of having free time all afternoon. I am looking forward to having your answer. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a new challenge, and not only for me, but for everyone there. Nobody thought I was capable of doing it. I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me, was driving me mad. Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge. I could listen the crowd shouting 'Go, Go'. That was my only chance.. Only  few more seconds, otherwise my time would be over. I didn't even think of boking down. I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all. Then, by some 'strange power' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it, but it was too difficult. The clock was running.. tic, tac... And suddenly everything stopped. I felt an enourmous peace. Somehow I managed to jump out of the airplane and I was flying! Those minutes, up in the air, feeling the wind in my face, were fantastic....And then I was terrified when I couldn't open the parachute! Fortunatelly, I wasn't alone. ",35
1114," Dear Mr Robertson, On the behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose to us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of the English culture... However, we would like to suggest you something: A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which seems to be very attractive. Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there. Let me explain  you what it is: It must be an exhibition which takes place in the ""Central Exhibition Hall"" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different leisures, make up and so on... What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a ""Shopping-Afternoon"" - that we can even put on Wednesday during the free-time - so that  to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show... Please, Let us know. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The respect of Famous people's private life has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a ""public job"". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox: Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question... As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a ""public job""?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed! But to solve this problem, we may think first about its origin... ""Reading the gossips"": isn't it what anyone of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy. Why not? To conclude, I would say that ""privacy"" and ""celebrity"" can't go together. It's just a matter of choice: being aware of that problem, everyone is free to become famous or not... ! ",32
975," 13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested  me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach the Korean children in Brighton about Korean and Korean history in the early August. Secondly, I would like to stay at log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doen't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.  [SEP]  When you spend money on goods and services, it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable. There are a few reasons. Firstly, you cannot always get the right one although you scour about all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired on your feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially, on the special occasion like on  sale. Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get  a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home. In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you. So you would spend more money  you have expected. To sum up, you should spend money as your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable. ",30
718," Dear Helen, I have just received your letter which made me so happy and I am writing to apply  your questions. First of all, I can travel only  July because my son's school is going to finish at the end of June, so it is impossible for me to travel during on June. Apart from that I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year so July is the best choice for me. I would rather stay in  tents because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family. I have always loved camping. My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it. I have been taking photographs since I was 17. I took some lessons and after that I have really improved it. Beside this, I am very good at playing basketball. I used to play in  high school's team. Also, I have some questions. I have never been to California before so I have no idea about the climate. Could you please give me some information about it and what kind of clothes should I bring for my holiday. Besides, I really would like to know, approxiametely how much money should I take with me? Is it an expensive city? I hope all those information will help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am so sorry that I couldn't write  you last week. As you know, I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked  as a director's assistant during the last week. First of all, it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer's name before who is called Tina. As a director's assistant my job was  arrangement of the audience's seats and tickets. All seats were brought from a sponsor company. Everyday I worked for two hours in a shop to sale tickets. It was quite enjoyable because everyday I met different people who like listening the  pop music so we had lots of things to talk about. I also helped  the singer's some special demands which weren't so difficult to do. She was very nice and friendly. At the concert night, I worked as well. After the concert I was absolutely exhausted but the thing is I will never forget this experience. I met lots of people who were very famous. The best thing was of course  Tina. We promised each other to keep in touch and she has invited me  her next concert! So, my news are finished. Write me back soon. Love from, ",32
948," Thank you very much for the prize. I turned crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition. I am just looking forward to going to Camp California. I've never been in the States before and having the chance to do it so makes me real happy. So let's answer the question you told me to in order to make that two weeks there as  funnier as possible. You asked me when would I like to travel to California. Definitely, in July. That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope just the sleeping one. That's the best suitable accomodation for a camping . It just keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience with the putt. I just hope not to get injured. One thing you have not told me is weather I have to pay  all things by my own in California or not. Please, let me know. Waiting for your answer, José  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part on the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me in the task, but that did not make it much easier. Any way, it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me. It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that. They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live. Great show. Next time come with me. I think Ernestina is coming to the city very soon. See you then! José ",34
307," Dear Mr Brown, I'm writing this letter to you to make a complain about the ""Over the rainbow"" musical show which I saw yesterday. I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because by seing your advertisment I expected more That show was entirely different to what it says on the advertisment . I arrived at the theatre at 19:30, found my seat and waited for forty-five minutes, with two hundred other people for the show to start. When it finally started I noticed that the famous actor Danny Brook was replaced by someone who was not as good as him. Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show. After some time a few of them started to leave the theatre. I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the hole show, which by the way was the worst I had ever seen. I don't know why I payed £20 with no discounts as the advertisements said it woul have. Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I wasted my time by coming here. I became furious when I saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to work  . So, I went home as fast as I could to write you this letter. I don't care what you will do about the theatre but I want my money back because this wasn't the perfect evening out you promised it would be.  [SEP]  The last forty years, technology has been growing very fast. first it was used only by the military or by scientists but  the last twenty years modern technology is found in any house, rich or poor and it helps people do hard work. Most houses have many electric devices like  microwave machine, an oven a mixer, a dish washer and many other things which can do a job by the press of a button. The last ten year computers had entered almost every house, especially in rich countrys. Competers entirely changed people lives. Children can play games on it or watch a film. There are millions of things you can do with a computer. You can listen to music and generally use it for fun but the primary reason that computer were invented was for communication. There are hundrets of prograns which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger which you wanna meet. Millions of people use computers for this reason. The general conclusion about computers is that they help people to have easier lives by doing hard work and helping them. They are important to people who like to have fun with games and they are, maybe the best way to communicate with someone you know or a person you want to meet ",28
723," 13th June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you and your organisation for giving me this opportunity. I've just received your letter this morning. I am very happy an exciting about it. I can only travel during July because I have many A-levels examinations to take during June. I would prefer staying in a tent because I haven't done it before and I would like to give it a go. I also would like to chose basketball and surfing as two activities to do while I am at the Camp. I am very keen on basketball. I am a captain of  school's basketball team and we have won many competitions. However, my surfing skill is very average as I have only been surfing for three months. There are two questions I would like to ask. First question is how many and what type of clothes do I have to take with me? Another question is how much money do I have to take with me (roughly)? I am really looking forward to take part at Camp California. Yours sincerely, Duangkamol (Denis) Saowaluk  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, How are you? I am fine. Remember I have told you that I have been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band? Well, it turned out really well and everybody had a great time. It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage. I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert, so I tried as well as I could. I didn't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea of the background of the stage was my, and I am very proud of it. Everything has been finally planed two days before the concert. On Saturday night, the concert began. Everything went really well, the music was great and the fans were loving it. When they've finished singing the last song I was surprice when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people. I am sure that I'll never forget that moment. Love, ",34
611," Hello Helen, I have recived your exiting letter, informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I will answer your questions in this letter begining with the best moment for the Camp. Because of my study I will not be free to travel until july and schools goes  on in August again so I hope July will be fine. I much prefer sleeping in tents, it seems more friendly and realy sounds like holydays. Choosing only two activities in such a bunch of interesting ones was quite hard, but I decided to take the two I've never tried, Climbing and Surfing. I would like to know what kind of clothes should I bring and wether I can wash it or not, and I'd like to know how much money will I need for extras? Thank you very much Yours sincerely Andre Michel  [SEP]  Hello Kim, How are you? Excuse me for the long time I left you without any news. I wrote  you last time that I was going to give a hand for the installation and preparation of ""Garbage's"" concert and you asked me to tell you how it has been. So one week befor the concert I went at ""L'Arena"" to meet the other worker and receive the instructions. I've had the hounour  to help their sound engeineer and branch the cables for microphones ggitares etc. We realy started to work like ants the morning befor the show. It was exiting looking  all three mens working together and building a scene, and it was interresting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configuring his computers to get the best sound possible. About two hours befor the beginning of the show, we met the band and recieved tickets to  backstage, that was wonderful, maybe better than the concert itself! And the next morning, I was here again to help them folding their stuffs. That's a great experienc! Now Kim, tell me about your side of the show Yours Andre ",26
705," Dear Ms Ryan Thank you for your letter. I was so happy to hear that I have won a two weeks holiday in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July. I am going to finish my exams in June, and I am planning to go back to China in early August. So if I could travel in July, and coming back before  6th of August, that would be great. I would prefer living in tents to log cabins. I have never had any experience  to live in a tent, so I would like to give it a go. I think I will enjoy myself in a tent. I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really wanted to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach  could give us a lesson during the Camp. Also, I would like to join  basketball team, I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during  last ten years in our city. I am glad I had taken a part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team. Would you tell me that how much money you would give it to me and how is the weather like in  U.S.A. Thank you for every thing! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine in your place. You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping  last month? I must say that was a great fun, I've never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets, they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had  chance to see most of the performance, that was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During  break time I did give a lots of direction to people who can't find  toilet, and  information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was  bit boring, but it was part of my job. I got to go. Write to you next time. Love ",34
1044," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for the programme which you have organised  the three days in London. However, some students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to have an opportunity to go to the show. The show is opened between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday, March 14 at  Central Exhibition Hall in London. Latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied. We have concerned it as a great opportunity to touch a part of  latest cultures, which are concentrated and sharpened in London. In addition, the addmission for students is free. Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that in  free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  The ways of living are always changing. It is no doubt that  functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation, for example, have been. Thinking about the home of the future, first of all, nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies, which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for  convenient life. People may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city. On the other hand, the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change. People always need their parents, children and so on. The longer and further they live on their own, the more they may feel that they need a family. New materials will surly change the home of the future in any ways. It is just staff's around us improving and turning into new one. Hopefully, the minds of people will stay peaceful and tender in the future. ",24
342," Dear Sir or Madam, I write you this letter to complain about your musical show. First of all, the show began three quarters of an hour late: it started at quarter past eight instead of half past seven, what of course was very bothering. I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appeared. He had been replaced by a really bad actor,  whom I don't even know the name. I was very disappoint of that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actor. There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets, what appeared to be wrong to. I had to pay the full prize for them, which was quite expencive. My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play. It turned  to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even received an explaination therefor. I had a really bad evening and would like to ask you for my money back. Waiting for your reply Yours faithfully Pierre Gaussier  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First off all, if computers haden't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of it! I use my computer for many things, such as homeworks, games, digital video or  Internet. The developpement of portable communication systems, such as mobile phones has greatly changed our way of life. It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen, even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other. Precision industry has changed my life a lot too. I practicate Scuba Diving during the week-ends and hollydays. That wouldn't have been possible a century ago, because all our material, such as dive computers, tanks or regulators didn't existed at that time. I think that we live easier now (thanks to modern medicine) and that our lives will get easier with the time. ",26
303," Dear Mister Muller, I address this letter to you because as the manager of ""The Circle Theatre"" I hold you responsible for the most disappointing evening in a theatre I had in years. I went to see the evening performance of your production of ""Over the Rainbow"" on saturday the 2nd of June. At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable. I bought one of the most expensive tickets. Although the show was scheduled to start at 19.30h, it did not begin until 20.15h. To my greatest disappointement Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement. After the show I had to find out that the theatre restaurant, that had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party. Contrary to your advertisement I had no ""perfect evening out"" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket. faithfully yours ....  [SEP]  Best detective stories of Agatha Christie That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie's ""Witness for the prosecution"". This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who inherited her whole fortune to him. He had befriended her without telling her that he was married. The accused is defended by a famous lawyer who tells his wife that a loving wife's confirmation of her husband's alibi will not convince the jury To help her husband she works out a plan: She is willing to be  witness for the prosecution and states that her husband has not been with her at the time the crime was committed. She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations. The plan works: The jury thinks that the wife is a notorious liar and her husband is found innocent. After the trial the lawyer is told that the man was indeed guilty. ",36
1102," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you concerning the London trip that my English class is going to do in March. First of all I want to thank you for the good programme that you mack for my class in such a short time. The students are especially very happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to do on tuesday morning of 14th March. The point of my letter is that  students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and they would appreciate  if they could go and see the show. The show is going to include  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles and best of all it is free for students to get in. The only problem is that the show is going to take place on tuesday of 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes in your programme. My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be showed. We suggest to swop shopping on tuesday and free time on Wednesday, so we can see the show on tuesday afternoon. I'll hope that this matter doesn't going to cause you any problems and we hope for an answer as soon as possible. Thank you  [SEP]  The home of the Futere In what ways do you think people's homes will be different in the future? That is the question, which many people ask themselves and other people quite often. The technologi is changing very fast and at the same moment as I'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new owen which co-operate with your refrigerator and has in the programme to make dinner for you every day without that you have to do anything. What about rooms which can feel your mood and acting after that, if you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing musik on and turn down the light a little bit. Next step might be a robot, which would do all your housework, but what would happened to the people? I think that everyone should not think just about the positive sides with technologi but also the negative. The technologi is good as long as it gives people more free time, but what would happened if freetime became your life? ",28
150," Dear Sir or Madam, I write to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre  the 9th june. To start with the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't perform as told. They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed  a musical. If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back; it would be the latter. But to add to this I had to make a long queue to get a full price ticket when instead I had brought my student card on the purpose of getting a discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist. The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore me and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed on sanitary reasons. For this deceiving and  uncorrect advertisement and for all the given reasons, I ask you for an average refund of five pounds per ticket. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This feature didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself. He wasn't really wicked, he merely didn't understand  to keep his mouth shut, especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called ""private life"" runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know. Well, some people just don't care, some are bothered and feel ill at ease. But  small drama can grow up as children are very sensitive. There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to the childhood and the teenage . We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human. According to me what is more to regret is when now we full-growns continue to act with this bad habit. The criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets. What allows us to reveal parts of someone others privacy, nothing. ",29
159," Dear Sir/Madam, Having seen your musical show last Sunday, I am writing to complain  the problems and to ask for some money back. Firstly, concerning  actors, in your advertisement you stated that DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE would perform in the musical, but in fact different actors performed. I was so disappointed!! Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant, to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minuits because it started at 20:15. As well as this, after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant, which you referred  in your advertisement, but it was closed already. I was really angry! Lastly, with reference to ticket prices, your theatre hadn't any discounts even for children. I had to buy an adult ticket for my child and spent more money than I had expected. I am sure you can imagine what I felt. It was not  perfect evening for me and my child at all! I am also sure you can refund my money. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Kwa Phat Sun.  [SEP]  Dear Tae, How are you getting on? I'm fine. Having talked with you a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to give you some information. I know you are always interested in detictive stories especially Agatha Christie's. Don't be surprised! Her best detective stories are going to be read on the radio this Sunday evening at 18:00. I'm sure you'll be pleased. You are supposed to listen to them. As well as this, the stories are going to be read in English. It's  good chance for you to improve your English. You can not only listen to her best detective stories, but also learn English automatically. It will be fantastic! Where the stories are concerned, they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and  naraitors are going to read clearly. What I'd like to say is you should listen to them. I hope you're happy to receive my letter and am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Kwa Phat Sun ",31
1240," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give you some advice of an international student conference. First of all, the name of  hotel which we have been booked into is  Palace Hotel. And we have two choices to get to the conference, a bus or a train. Both of them are as convinience as getting there. The day before we will leave there, we have a party which takes place in our hotel. It is a kind of formal party, so we should be well-dressed. I suggest that you wear a formal dress. There is some finger foods and drinks. It might be a great party for  end of  conference. End of all, in my opinion we could go  a center of the town because there is many places to have a look  and go shopping. It's quite a nice  and a suitable place to spend for three hours. It could be interesting for them. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Imagine our life without a telephone. If a telephone haven't been invented, we wouldn't have lived perfectly like nowadays. Wouldn't you think we rely on it more than we expect? A telephone is used when we need to contact with someone, and also an emergency situation and  an internet. It has various way to use, however, nowadays it is not only used by these purpose, but also it keeps our company. Even if you feel alone, you can talk and hear from your friend easily. Then it makes you happy. Long time ago people lived without this perfect invention. But how? They used to keep in touch with someone with a letter. In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with, it was a only way. So that's why they have invented a telephon. Now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone. Who wouldn't  thank for this great invention? ",23
415," Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to ""the Circle Theatre"" looking forward to watching your musical ""Over the rainbow"". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-five minutes later. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles with buying a ticket before: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing . This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything   had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced  to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)  [SEP]  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" I heard somebody say ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death. The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping  to the line where the fish is on. The reader feels with him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up. Although this situation might not  very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.  ",37
173," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a number of points. I went to London on holiday and to The Circle Theatre to see Over The Rainbow. Although, this musical show was not as good as I expected. First of all, was the show suppossed to start at 19.30, but it started first at 20.15. To make matters worse, instead of Danny Brook performing you had another actor, which was very disappointing. Secondly, it says in your advertisement that discounts would be available, despite the fact they were not. On top of everything, you recommended to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. however this was closed due to lack of personall. According to your brochure it says this would be the perfect evening out. According to my experience it was not. I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Carley Agda Nilsen  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Designers are improving their skills all the time. Nowadays, there are more and more people who wants to become designers and the competion is increasing. Everybody wants to be the best. Due to this the quality of clothes is getting better and in 100 years we will be asking for a bigger variety of clothes. Although, the price of clothes is increasing, people still buy them. We give other things priority so we are able to afford our clothes. On the whole, people nowadays, do care more about their appearance and will be continuing to do . It appears that people are more aware about clothes and also work. I think people in the future will begin to only wear fashionable clothes. If you feel nice, in an outfit your confident will be likely to increase and this might also help you to get a better career in your work, something which is very important today. ",37
379," Dear Ms. I am writing to you becaus I was very disappointing with the presentation you have made to attract people to come to your theatre. First of all I came to see a play just becaus my faivourite actrice shoud of been part in it, but she didn't. The evening time on a tiket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 which made visitors stay in a plase for 45 min,  waist of time. The tickets discounts was not available under any subconstanses and the theatre restaurant was closed. I strongly do recomand your to pay  minimum 50% of the full price for what I've payed. Your faithfull Mr. Farydone.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly different. In my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming as well as people  become more niceer, less   will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray. It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable. Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking  clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and Green pease will  very strong community, much stronger and  pouful than it is now. So as we can think the Future Fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people. The stile will be more or less simelar to each other and everyon will be setisfaid with its needs. writen by H. Farydone ",14
1013," Dear Mr Robertson My name is ... and I am a student representative. I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London. First of all I would like to thank you for organizing the programme. I read it and found it very good, specially,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts. However, I have a great proposition for you. Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I thing it is a great opportunity for us, as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students. Girls should like to see the latest fashion, new make-up and interesting hairstyles. Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear. I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing form you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  THE HOME OF THE FUTURE Home is an important element in everybody's life. It gives you safety. I do not know people who would not want to have a home. We like our houses that is why  are always trying to make it more comfortable and useful. I think The Home of the Future will be bigger as we will need more room for us, our belongings and interests. The construction will be more simple what will give us a feeling of balance. More houses will have gardens what will make us feel closer to the nature. Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside. I do not think so. Because of computers we will have the possibility of working at home, therefore, home will be  very important place worth paying attention . Take care of your home, do not hesitate  in it and you will be very happy. ",30
89," Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was an other actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to , the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed for all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there wasn't any discount! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I hadn't a great fun, so I ask for  money back. Your faithfully  [SEP]  In fact, some days before Karin, a friend of hers, had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John, her science's teacher. Pat was astonished, and didn't know what (she) had to tell Karla. The teacher was 40 years old, and Karla was only 16 (years old). This age's difference was too big! Besides, Karla was a shy, polite girl that Pat wanted to help. So she decided to tell Hill all the story. Hill like Pat very much, but only as a friend. He was 19 (years old), so Pat thought, that he had to know what was the best thing to do. But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousine. They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream. So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they had know her feelings to Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything forever. ",25
219," Dear Sir or Madam I am writting to complain about I am really disappointed  your musical show which is ""over the rainbow"". on last week. I could compare between the advertising of  musical and  actual musical show last week. First of all, the advertising shown us starring, which is Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, however, when I had seem it, starring of  musical completely diffarent actors, I  really disappointed about it. Secondary, the advertising shows as the musical start  14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started  20:15, it's 45 minuts late, and also, I'd asked  discount ticket in the ticket counter, but there are not available any discount tickets. Finally, your theatre restaurant was closed after  show, it is because I saw it was opened at break time for musical, but afterwards, the people of staff for restaurant were closing. Now then, how was this advertising, it was completely diffarent, I am really disappointed  your musical, I am ask you for  money back, because I wasn't enjoyed your musical. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your Faithfully, from  [SEP]  I am writting  composition about ""How has modern technology changed your daily life"", this is our question. All at the technology developed about every day, not all of them, but still a lot of modern technology changed our daily life. First of all, I thought more than half  population of British has  ""mobile phone"", it is small and compact, much lighter than  home telephone, and one of the biggest advantage is you can carry it, so that   easy to contact your friend or someone who other, even they can easy to contact you as well, so you can phone anytime you wants, whenever you wants. Secondary, Personal Computer (PC), these ""Desk Top"" and ""Lap Top"" computers developed each year, however,  most important thing is  ""Internet"", Mobile phone could easy to contact anyone in your country,  ""Internet""  easy to contact  world wide, you can send E-mail anytime, anywhere you wants, it is  most popular thing  all of the world.

804," Dear Helen Ryan, I have happily received your reply letter and I want to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only period of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should give me a good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity and entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis for you. I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good in it. At tennis I'm the best player of my whole school and once, I got to the top 10 of my country in tennis . I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring? Money, how much should I bring. Would $200 be enough? Well that's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely Basilio Romero  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shoke our hands. I'll never wash my hands again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon. Basilio Romero ",35
441," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Firstly, the actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Danny Brook did not appear in the show, it was another actor. This was really disappointing. Secondly, the show was really late . It started at 20.15, not at 19.30 as it was supposed to be. And, although you have promised  in your advertisement, there were no discounts available. To make things worst, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show in that date. To sum up, it was not a perfect evening out. And, I would appreciate  if you give me a refund. I look forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, funny and confortable. I think that we will not use formal clothes anymore. People will prefer to use confortable clothes, even to go to the office. The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more funny. We will not use black clothes as we are used to do. People will use yellow, pink and green clothes. This way, people tend to be happier. However, the clothes will not be as  teenagers use to wear nowadays to go to ""raves"". It will be more beautiful and clean. Mainly, people will not be so fashionable as they are nowadays. They will wear a  clothe only if they feel good wearing it. Actually, I think that the clothes will be really simplier in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then. ",27
588," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I am very pleased about the prize I just won in your competition. Thank you for choosing me. Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement. First of all, I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July. As my family's new restaurant is about to open in August, I need to help with the restaurant, which is expected to be rather busy. Secondly, I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp. I had  bad experience last time I lived in a tent. I was terribly attacked by a been and it still gives me nightmares! As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating to challenge  waves. I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future. In addition what kind of clothes shall I bring with me? How much money is  appropriate to carry? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready? That was a pop concert of Steps in  M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean. A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform  other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to  other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well. I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying ""thank-you"" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene. All in all, it was a once-a-lifetime experience. Yours, ",38

I am really excited to travel at Camp California in the USA because I like to know people of other countries. As I only have holidays on July I would like to travel on this month. I would prefer to have accommodation in  log cabins because I like to be comfortable and I don't like to be lied down on the floor inside a tent. I would like to play basketball because I love this game. I used to play when I was at high school. I think that I am a very competitive player, as well or a  technical player. Also I would like to do swimming. I think that I am  very fast swimming but I don't have good style and technic. I would be grateful if you could send me more information about what clothes and money I must take. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, RAEL MEDINAH  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have been helping to organise a pop concert in Dublin. As you know I love irish music so I was very happy when the organisers of the concert phone me to help them. The organisers paid for my acommodation and travel to Ireland. I arrived at Ireland on 2th July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to built the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened  irish music and suddenly we saw to U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us. I could speak to my favourite singer 'Bono', I could meet him and I helped him to repair his guitar because it didn't sound very well. The rest of the days I wasn't doing anything especial, just I helped to organise the rehearsals of the differents group who were going to play in the concert. Best wishes, ",29
519," Dear Sir, I'm writing in order to make you know how angry I am for having gone to one of your shows. I went to London for a week's holiday with some friends and every evening we decided something to do in order to enjoy our staying in that beautiful city. I wish we had never chosen your show. In fact, only after having going into the theatre, I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show. First of all, when I paid  my ticket I noticed that nobody could obtain the discount you'd written about. But that would be nothing if I thought to dinner I had to cancelled because your show started at 20.15, although it should have been at 19.30! Besides, when we decided to spend the evening in the theatre restaurant, we were informed that it was closed because the chef was ill. At that point, even if there had been Danny Brook as the advertisement announced, it wouldn't have been a less disappointing evening. According to all these things, I ask  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but I realized it only when it was too late. What have moved me to this discover were the facts that happened last month. I had just quarreled with Jon, who is my fiance. In that period we weren't getting on with . So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking at the consequences. And there would have been no problems if I hadn't talked to Pat about that evening. It was only a dinner with a friend and in fact we'd spent all the time remembering our childhood, but probably Pat can have thought that Peter and I weren't only friends. So she ran to Jon in order to make him know  the terrible mistake I had made that evening. He became very angry no matter how hard I tried telling him the truth. By the way, I've understood I had better trust in nobody. ",28
1124," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising a good programme for us. All of my classmates are expecting to go to London. I am satisfied with your programme. However I would like to suggest a good idea as a representative of our class. We have just sen the advertisement for 'The London fashion and Leisure Show'. The show include the latest fashions, sports wears and make up. We are very keen on the fashions and make up. Moreover, the admittion fee is free for students. It would be a great opportunity to study the latest fashion trend. It is held at the 'Central Exhibition Hall' on 14 March., from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Therefore we could go there after the Science Museum. If some students want a  shopping, they could go on 15 March. Because we have a free time on 15 March  afternoon. I hope you will consider my suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'A robot wakes me up at 7 A.M. every morning. I am served breakfast with fresh coffee. Washing and cleaning have been already done by my robot maid! Everybody might dream about this kind of situation. It would be come true in the near future. Our robot maid will do all of  house work instead of  human. In addition to this you will be able to control all part of  house by a computer such as temperature or vacume cleaning. However, this robot can not replace of mother or wife. They can clean the house but they can not give the affection to the family. Children need parents love and support all the time. To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives would be more convenience. But these robots can not be replaced of  warm-heart human. ",25
393," Dear manager, My name is German Schmidt an in the last week I went in your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There are some problems, we have to speak about. At first, the actor was not Danny Brook there was a different actor, who I don't know. In the advertisement of the show  was written that the musical will be start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. After the musical show I want to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are in holidays. And this  not  perfect evening in your theatre was very expensive for me. I've payed £ 160 for eight people and there was no discounts available. In my oppinion you have to give some money back to me. I think 50% (£80) are enough. If you give no money back, I will go to the newspaper. faithfully  [SEP]  At first I would say that our technology level, in this  time are very high but in the future it would be higher. With the help of some modern technology our daily life would not  so difficult. One point in my life is home banking. With the help of my home computer I can do all  thing, about money, with my bank. Some years ago I have to go to the bank. The new way is very easy and faster and I can spent my time with other things. An other point is the modern technology in my car. Because of the modern technology, the safety level in my car is very high. At the end I would say that everybody of us can not live without the modern technology, because the modern technology is necessary for us in all parts of our life. ",21
1023," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you to thank you for the organising our programme for a trip to London, I'm  student at  College of Economics and I was chosen to write to you about this matter. Our class really appreciate for preparing this programme, especially for Monday's atraction. We are extremaly interested in wisiting London. The idea of sightseeing by bus would be a great possibility for us to know better our wonderful capitol. Although we are excited about the scientic, I would like you to ask, if it would be possible to change our schedule a little bit. In  last edition of 'London's Guide' we saw an advert of 'The London Fasion and Leisure Show', which will be held on Tuesday and it lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentiones  'latest fasions', which we are incredible interested in. In addition it recommends also  'Leisure and Sports Wear'. Thing which attract us the most are: 'Make up' and 'Hairstyles'. We strongly recommend it, because students' admission is free. I'm convinced that you agree with us and we take part in this show. We would be terribly grateful, if you accept our offer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Nowedays famous people don't have an easy life. They are always attacted by naughty journalists, which have  aspiration to earn big money for writing an extremaly good report, or article. To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly. In addition we are fascinated in their marriage, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known. By chosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look like. On the other hand, their life has no privaty. In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxiously and lonely. They are always under high pressure in their every-day life, because they are afraid of being recognise. Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions and films-stars belong to the public. In conclusion, I belive that we have  right to be informed about their life, providing that journalists respect some important rules. ",25

The Hotel that is booked for the students it is one of the beast in the area, it has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be. The best way to get there from The hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day you arrive, at 8:30 am. About the party which is just at the end of the conference, a good it would be a dance party and the students don't really need to wear special clothes, it's just to have a little dance and meet all the students, after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice  to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back. I hope this letter aswer all your questions, if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter. your sincerely  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart buildings which was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector. In addition the resort has an interesting History background about  arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example, it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico. On the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities. In spite of the disadvantages, I would strongly recomended to students and  public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings. and have a great experience knowing about  buildings history and at the same time traveling around Mexico.

It is my pleasure to help you with the information you need. Your group has been booked into The Palace Hotel, located on the High street, opposite to the Post Office. The conference will be hold in The Royal Hall, and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus. Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall. The end-of-conference party will be hold in Francescos Restaurant, just by The Royal Hall. You should wear casual clothes. About what you can do in the area for the free time you have, I would suggest you to visit The Modern Art Museum which has now a new exhibition. Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through the Spring Gardens which are beautiful in this time of the year. I hope all this information is helpful for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Telephone: A great invention. Imagine your life without a telephone. Yes, I know, it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention. Think about the people living in the time it was invented. Must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for........ and now for us  is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to. Of course  is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family, but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies. For example, I work for a bank, and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far, and he doesn't have to come here, we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks, and that is it! What about emergencies? A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the life of many people having a heart attack. We sometimes don't realize the importance of some inventions we use in our everyday life. But think...., what would we do without them! ",35
1222," Dear Mrs Smith, I have recieved your letter this morning. I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group. I hope that these informations below are very useful to you, during your attempt of  conference. I have booked a hotel not far off from our school. The hotel is called  Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00. There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk. You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00. You will than have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage. The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you to leave  hotel by 12:00. The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the collage road and turn left toward the end, you than keep going straight, you will eventually see the main entrance of the collage. When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all knows where the conference is and when. At the end of the conference, we will have a party. The party is to let all the students  to know each other better. The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room. I will suggust them to wear formal clothing, as in tie, trousers and blaser. For the afternoon free time on the last day. There are a wide variety of choices  that they can do. They can play tennis, do athletics, swimming... and many other sports event in our school, if they want to. Or they can also visit the Epsom Town. There are shops which sales cloths, foods, and books ... They can decide what they want to do, it's entirely up to them. I am looking forward to seeing you and hop you have a safe flight over to England. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear group leader, Welcome to Taiwan. This report is based on an interesting building, where you can take, for your students to visit. This building is situated in Taipei, the capital. The building is called  Chiang Kei-shek Momerial Hall. Nearly everyone knows where this building is, so if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building. The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds. As you go into the main Hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei-shek, this is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in History. The statue is about 20 feet high. Next to the statue is protected by the guards, the guards will change every four hours. Apart from the main Hall, there are also lots of other gallaries. In these gallaries there are Historical paintings, antique furnitures which Chiang used. These treasure are very old, even older than the history of America. All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang during the defeat in China. They are all been well look after. As well as all the treasures, statue and historical paintings...There are also restaurent's and modern gallaries. When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with historical thing, you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern. Finally, if you went to visit this building I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called  Hyatt Hotel. It only take about five minutes if you walk. I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan and I hope you will enjoy the building.  ",36
1058," To: The Principal of Westminster College, Mr Robertson. From: Eirini X FCE Student Dear Sir, I am writing to you with a request for a change in the scedule of our trip to London. But, first of all, I would like to thank you for the time and the effort you have made to organize the entire programme. Everything seams very interesting and I am sure that we will all have a very good time. Unfortunatly I have to suggest a change for the programme of Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the ""Fashion and Leisure Show"" takes place that date in London. All of the students - including my self, think of this as a great opportunity that  would be  pitty to be missed, especially when students can enter for free. According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show. I hope that you will find this possible. With best regards  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to try my limits for once again. This is my nature. I had to see how far I could go this time or, to be more specific, how high! I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumpping in my vains, full of adrenaline, tolet myself free to shake, from excitement. There were my thoughts when I first saw the advertisement for a ""Sky Dive"". I didn't hesitate much. The same afternoon I picked up the phone and I gave them a call. That was it. The following Sunday I fint my self on a plain flying 20000ft from the ground. When the time for the jump came I had some second thoughts. But then, I thought of the birds again - of how nice it would be to share their world for a few minutes and, I jumped! Well, danger is in my nature an Life is nothing but an adventure. ",37
867," Dear Helen. It is so nice to hear the news from you that I have won the first prize. I'm looking forward to getting sun-tanned under the sun in California. Here are the information which you asked me for. I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days. Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July. I'd prefer to say in log cabins. Because our family had some bad experiences with using tents. Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent. It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled. Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money for me. Thanks Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dearest Kim How are you? I wish you are fine. I'm fine either but I'm quite busy to find another part time job after the one, which was the concert supporting  one. I remember that you asked me to tell you about that job. It was fantastic but a bit hard! First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office. It was quite terrible when I had to let people leave, because all tickets were sold out. Then the concert started, I was called from one of the staffs for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next work I was gives was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore? It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested . But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even join that fantastic atmosphere. What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium. And that mad the concert absolutely perfect. I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together. Stay pretty and lovely! Kisses from  ",30
743," Dear Sir/Madame, I'm writeng with reference to your letter. I've being very thrilled, when I've known, that I won first prize in your competition. I always dreamed about going to the California and now my dreams are coming truth. If it's possible, I would like to travel only  July, because my school won't be finished earlier. I couldn't go  August, either, because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends. If I had a choice, I would prefer to live in  tent then in a log cabin. I can't imagine real holidays without a tent. It's one of the most important things for me, to have a chance to forget about all my present, luxurious life and try doing something different. I would be very grateful, if you gave me a possibility of singing. I've always wanted to learn singing professionaly, but I've never had an occasion. I'm very keen on swimming, too. Normally, I live in the seaside and I couldn't live without this sport. Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters. distance. I would like to ask you what clothes should I take with me? My mother told me, that when she had been there two years ago it was really hot. Should I take with me a lot of money? You know, I'm only a student. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely Halina Lipnicka  [SEP]  Hallo, Kim! Thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't rewritten sooner, but I was very busy. I must tell you that helping at pop concerts is very exciting, but very tiring too, so I had to rest. You asked me about my experiences. Well, it was the best time of my life! I worked all days, but I did it with pleasure. We lived here in rush, but there was a lot of fun, too. I was very surprised, when I saw that singers aren't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers. One day I was talking to Stenkovska, because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone, so I should ask her what did she want. When she tried to answear me, one small child made her a picture with  flesh. Imagine, she weren't angry! She said he should do it again, because she had stupid features! If I were she, I would kill that boy, but she was nice! Trully, my work here wasn't very important, but I relly enjoyed it. I've met here so many new people! Sometimes somebody should on me, but I have to say they are often right. Well, I made  couple  mistakes. The hardest was, when I brought a pepperoni pizza for kubulska, but she doesn't eat meat! But, for luck, it wasn't achieved with succes of our concert. You have to admit, that the show was magnificent. I hope you had a great fun when you was watching us at the TV set, didn't you? O.K. That's all for today. I'll write  you again tomorrow, because now my Mom is angry, the I'am not sleeping yet. Write soon! I can't hardly wait. Give my best to your parents. Hugs and kisses Halina.

1143," Dear Mrs. Brown I am writing to inform you about a party that we decided to organise for Mr. Brown's birthday. I want to ask you to come to our party and also to help us about what present shall we buy for Mr. Brown. To begin with, I must explain to you that the party is a surprise for Mr. Brown and it would take place on Tuesday 16th of June from 3:00 to 6:00 pm at the college canteen. Some of the children will bring food and also there would be nice music too. Also, I want to mention that all the class will come, all the teachers will be there, and the Principal will come too. Finally, I want to ask you about Mr. Brown's present. We dont have any idea what to buy for him. Can you help us? I think that a good present could be a CD or a book. What do you think? We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderfull time together. I will look forward to hearing from you soon.  [SEP]  My favourite season of the year is summer. I think that most of the people love summer, especially the people in Greece. I dont know why but the summer it is the most beautiful season. All the scenery with the lovely sun, the wonderful beaches, the green mountains and the smell of the sea, make me feel great. I live in Greece, and especially in an island, so I know very well what summer means. It means swimming at the wonderfull beaches, tasting the delicious foods ad having  wonderful time every day and every night with your friends. Also it means to meet other people, to have fun together, to travel at all the places of the island. I think that the summer makes people to feel great, to have fun, to enjoy themselves. I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have  wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever the go. ",28
280," Dear Mr. Smith; I am writing this letter to make you know  the bad points of the theatre. First, it didn't start at 19.30. It started at 20.15. We had to wait for 45 minutes. I got bored. Not only me but also the others got bored. It was wrote in the newspaper that Danny Brock took place in the play. But it was not Danny Brock, it was a different actor. If there had been a problem, it would have been told us. I wanted to see him but I couldn't see . This was very disappointing for me. When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount. But in the newspaper it was wrote to be a discount. I paid £20 to the cashier. I was hungry and I thought I could eat something at the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed without any reason. It was very rude. For this, I want my money back. Because I didn't enjoy  at the theatre. I hope you would not continue like this. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES Technology is the thing that makes our life easy. Technology is in every part of our life. We use cars, trains, ships or planes when we want to go somewhere. But if they weren't made, we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey. With the help of technology, we do our works in less time. For example; in the past people used horses to go  another place. And their life passed in the ways. But now we use planes to go  far  places. It takes less time than going by horse. And computers,  the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day by playing  computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their works. They connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes into the computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them. But it has also bad points. For example; wars. Using technology scientists make lots of powerful guns. It is bad for the world's piece. I think we should use the technology for the piece and use it for our fortune. ",24
966," 13th June 2000 Dear Edouard, Firstly, let me thank you for your nice letter of June 10th. I was so surprised but so glad to read that I won the first prize in your competition. In response to your question and if you don't mind, I would prefer to travel in July because I've already chosen my holiday and my boss won't give me another one. I would be grateful if I could accommodate in a log cabin. I'm no more a young girl! and do appreciate a little bit of comfort. As you asked me, my favourite activities would be painting and climbing. I like very much the moutains and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk. Would you be so kind as to write  me as soon as possible because I need the accurate date of the journey. I've got four children and have to organise their time without  mother. Furthermore, I would like to know exactly which kind of clothes I have to take with  and how much money I'll be supposed to spend there. I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Edith-Marilyn Piaf  [SEP]  Shopping is  my everyday life. I'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (monstruous) and goes on with clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely to what you could think, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children  always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing. Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream! To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage on shopping: you need money! You'll understand, I'm sure, that I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month. In order to change this situation I could win the lottery: a dream too! ",29
1197," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received yesterday. Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations, which might be useful for the students. First of all, the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel, which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities. This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall. You will be able to get there either by bus (no 150) or on foot. Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference. It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last the whole night. People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi-coloured clothes. Finally I think that you should jump at  opportunity to go to the historical Pergam's Museum before leaving. Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there. I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth. Your sincerely  [SEP]  To: (group leader) From: Subject: Bournemouth National Museum As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum, which is, to my mind, one of the most interesting buildings of the area. Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need. 1. Architecture The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit 'heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world. 2. Exposition Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum. 3. Restaurant The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum. To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant  to have a rest if you need to. ",39
1093," Dear, Mr Robertson. I am writing to ask  some information about the programme which our class would like to join. There are a few questions which I have wondered. First of all, Would you give me an explaination about the London fashion and Leisure show? We regard that the show might be  great opportunity for the most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure. In addition, I would like to get your suggestion  how  programme could be changed on the second-day of the trip. so that we could enjoy going to both  science Museum and the London fashion and leisure show. I am appreciated  you for offering a well-organised programme, especially, the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in. I am looking forward to getting your reply. your sincerely.  [SEP]  In the middle age, Nobody expected to have a electric goods which have been helping to do housework. It made woman to be free from drudgery, so that they could utilize time for improving themselves. As the result, we can observe that the home of the present have a lot of machines which make home like a factory. By contrast, In the future, I guess we would rather go back to the acient time, owing to have natural life style. We will be unwilling to give a housework away. Being at home with doing housework, taking care of their children, might be  purpose of the future life. ",18
341," Dear Mr. ... It wasn't the first time for me to visit this show in your theatre, but it was the worsed one. At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket therefor becauses I'm one of the greatest fan of Danny Brook. It's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it, because I'm (alowed?). When  musical started at 20:15 (not at 19:30 as showed) I was realy shokked when I realised that a different actor was playing . I couldn't stay any more and had to leave the theatre. You have to know that I am very sik because of my blood presure and so I was laying down the hole weekend. In my opinion it's a simple way for you to pay me the money I left back. Otherwise I have to contact my lower. I am waiting hearing of you.  [SEP]  For me as an scientist it's a main problem to show how the inovations of the last century goes up with the environment and natur. In  past new technologies  mostly followed by ground-, water- or air pollution. A nowadays simple thing like a computer include so many possible ways  to destroy different environmental compartiments. On the one hand there are the materials from which the PC's are made of, on the other hand is the uge waste problem situated. Now I try to show, in my daily work, how the airborn chlororganics, which are degased from plastics, will be seperated and damaged by green plants. Sometimes it seems to me like  joke if I remember all the daungerous materials I need to do my job. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the only way to find a better kind of living with the nature is to check out the problems we have. Therefore it make sense to use the inovation which are standing for environmental destructions. ",15
636," Dear Sir/Madam: Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested. First of all, I think I would like to travel in July, which will be the only month for me to go. Because my course won't finish until the end of June, and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term. Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others . However, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose,  one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most, I and my friend used to win the first place in  school-wide match when we was in school. And  the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; Painting is one of my hobbies and I've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it once I have  free time. Above are all the information you asked , however, here are something I'd like to know;  first is about the clothes, what kind of clothes  I need to take with ? And another question is what is the prices of things like in there,  so that I can make a better buget of my trip. Look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would  interested at my experience of helping  the pop concert last time, now I tell you about it. The place  we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage, the equitment, and the lights. In fact, there is nothing very important I did, because we are not the right people to do it. I only put the speakers in the right places, or helping  engieners tested the lights. But at the brakes and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engieners, and I leant something about setting up the equitment. The fourth day, the singers and the players have been to there to test. Then I had a chance to speak with them. From that, I learnt more about  instruments. Finally, the date of  concer came. After the concer finished successfully, I was happier than ever because the succeed inclueded my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life. Anyway, now I have to stop to finish my homework. I'm looking forward to receiving your letter again. Best wishes. ",24
328," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to give my opinion about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"". I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". To tell the truth, it was a very disappointing evening. When I read the advertisement first, I thought that it would be fun. In the advertisement, it was written that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing. The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15. Which means, I had to wait there for 45 minutes. And also, it was written that the discounts were available but they were not. After the show, I decided to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. On the door, there was a note saying that the restaurant was closed because of the illness of the cook. I had given £20 and now, I would be pleased if you give some of my money back. It was a terrible evening out for me. I hope the next musical show would be a better one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY In the past, everything was very different. People had completely different life-styles. People were using candles to see around them. In winter, they used to fire some woods to keep warm, ""Computer"" was a word that nobody had known the meaning of it. As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-and white. Their hobies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything. Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We are using mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or on a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every section of our lives. We also have  ""internet"", by which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute. Modern technology is very important for all the countries. It has a very big role in developing a country. When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used in everything. I think, we are all very lucky people that we aren't using candles or black and white televisions anymore? ",32
688," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing as a reply to your letter, congratulating me to the winning of the first prize in your competition and inviting me to the Camp California in the U.S.A. I was delighted to hear from you and am already looking forward to spend two weeks in California. I am afraid that the only possible time for me to travel is in July because it is the only month I am able to get time off work. As an accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to the nature while camping a lot. The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing, which I have never done before and tennis which I already play quite well. I need to know how much money you would advise me to bring and what sort of clothes I should take with me. I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience and to get to know you personally in July. Yours faithfully, Esther Meyer  [SEP]  Dear Kim, thanks a lot for your long letter! It was great to hear from you again after such a long time. You asked me, how the pop concert was like which I told you I was going to go to in my last letter. Well, let me tell you, it was just awesome! My job was it, to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area. Therefore I got to stay backstage all the time and to see all the members of the ""Backstreet Boys"". And, you won't believe it, I actually got to talk to Nick Carter! Yes, that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience  to be part of the crew. I sort of felt, like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess. Do you know, what I mean? Anyway, I've got to study now, we've got a maths exam tomorrow. Hope to hear from you soon Lots of love, Esther ",38
807," Dear Helen, I received your letter the other day,  I was very happy to find out that I won two weeks at Camp California. Well, to answer to your questions, I would prefer to attend at this camp during the month of July because it is the only time when I can get vacations. It is because I am an apprentice, so they let me have my vacations only in July!! Well, for the accomodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like  adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to the nature, and the animals! For the activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it, I used to do some competitions when I was younger. And for the other  I will chose tennis, I really enjoy this sport, I am not really a good player but I like to practice tennis during my free time! Since I'm coming during the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me, and I have another question, it's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have change or checks? Best Regards, Helen  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Well this is abosolutly true, espacially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed, and most of the people are stressed, it's crazy. For exemple you go into a cloth shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt, so they are looking every where, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have  and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose. And you have to wait after  to buy it, so finally you waited so long that you are getting late, so you get stressed to. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them. So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if I can give you an advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!! ",34
81," 17th December, 2000 Jane Clark, organizer Dear Madam, I'm writing this letter to congratulate you for the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy last November. I found it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions. First of all, because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting. Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because  the short number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival. Finally, the prize was reasonably and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend. I hope you'll attend my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Once upon a time, in a small Catalan village, there was a little boy who loved cheating and making jokes. His father was a shelter,  He had one hundred sheeps and one dog, and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them. One day, he became ill and was worried about the animals. His little son, called Joan, decided quickly: ""I will help you. I will take care of the sheeps for you, father"". the next day he went to the mountain with the animals. At the beginning he was excited but soon he got bored. ""Let's have a bit of fun"", he thought. And then he started shouting: ""the fox! Help me! the fox!"" Some people went to help him, and then realised that it was not true. They were angry. He did it  more times, and at last nobody cared of the shoutings. One day, the fox attacked his animals and he shouted as much as he could. Nobody came. Then he learned to say always the truth. ",31
257," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre  the 5th of June. I have been very disappointed by the quality of the show and the lies in your advertisement. Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without  information or excuse  from the direction. Secondly, I coudn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill. I am therefore asking for a complete refund of my ticket and I hope you will improve the quality of your services in the future. Yours faithfully H. Coulez  [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The poor boy was only 5 year old and at this age, it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret. So when he heard at random that my parents were planning to offer me a trip to San Fansisco as  present for my birthday, my little brother ran in my bedroom wherever I was studying and whispered in my ear the wonderful news. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a place on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for already one month.

583," Dear Mrs Helen, I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you giving me. Fist of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is  hotest mounth in the year, and the weather shall be really nice. Secondly, I think it is would be better to stay  tents, so than we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play in. However, as you asked me to choose two activities, I'm choosing swimming and climbing, because I'm very good at swimming and I would like to try myself at climbing. Despite the small expereance in climbing I do want to try this type of sport. In addition, I would like to know how much money do I have to bring with me. I think that it is all what I would like to know. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to suggest wich lessons and other activities should be filmed. I have enterwed each student from my English class. Fistly, the English lesson must be filmed as the most interesting lesson at our school because it will give to students an interest  to study and improve their noleges. Also you can have a good practice with English with students, who came from different countries. ",18
485," Dear Sir/Madam. My name is Veronika. And I visited your theatre to see a musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am writing to you to say that it was a very disappointing evening. And I'll try to explain why. First of all, there were the different actors in a show, but you didn't say anything about it before the show. The other point was the beginning of the show. It started at 20:15, but it was said that it starts at 19:30. As a result I missed my train. The third problem was the discounts. There were no ay discount at all. But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with the discount. And the last disappointment was your restaurant after the show. It was closed because of the lack of stuth Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So as a conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully. With the best wishes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? We know that everything is changing. And of course the technology is also changing. Not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand, but now there re a lot of machines to do the same. And it makes our life easier. Now we have free time to do anything else, while  machine is doing our work. It's connected with our house, our workplace and e.t.c. For example, earlier I used to wash my clothes by hand, but now I have the last version of wash machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand. Earlier it took me 3 hours, but now it is my free time and I can go for a walk with my friends. Another example is that earlier we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy. Now we have a scanner and a printer to do it. And it takes bout 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour. So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the   really important for our life things. ",28
1004," Dear Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for your letter! I went in for your competition and I was really anxious about the results. I am surprised that I won the first prize but also very happy about it! Therefore it would be my pleasure to reply to your letter. Firstly, I would like to arrive at the Camp in July if that is possible because I am working and I will not have spare time before this month. Secondly, you are mentioning ""tents or log cabins"" as the accommodation provided. I would rather live in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature I adore the sound of the wind, trees, animals and everything which is surrounding . I could feel the environment. Thirdly, as far as the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming as well as tennis. I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home. I do sports a lot so apart from  tennis I am a member in our local swimming centre. I can reasure you that gradually I am improving my sports skills. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes do I have to bring with me. Is the weather changeable? I was also wondering if I will need any money. I would appreciate  if you could let me know as soon as possible. I hope the information given will be of use. I have tried to be as helpful as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to you about my previous experience. I know how impatient you are  about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing! As I've told you, last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the ""spactetors"" if you can call them like this. Can you imagine? There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff  worth? You don't even want to know. Apart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert. They had to chose their clothes,  give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect! Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words ""reliability"" and ""responsibility"". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is  far more enjoyable and relaxing. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes ",34
1110," Dear Mr Robertson, I am a student of the English class. All my class mates are looking forward to go to London. Thank you so much for organising such a great program. I am writing  you about changing our plan on Tuesday 14 March. The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to the show. The advertisement saids it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm. Since the London Fashion and Leisure Show is not taken place so often and also they will offer the students for free entrance fee this time, if we joined in this show, it would be  great opportunity for us. For these reasons, we would like to suggest you to go to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon. I hope I will hear from you soon. I am sure that our travel is going to be great. Thank you very much Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.  Otherwise I had to keep walking untill the train start. Have you stayed at a park during the night? When I did that, I was traveling around Japan. It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto. Although I intended to stay at  youth hostel, I could not find any place to stay, and also it was too late to buy a train ticket to go back home. It was a windy spring day. I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossam tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moon light helped me to see the things. I was regretting I risked staying at the park alone. Suddenly,  strong wind blew up the thousands and thousands  pieces of flowers. It was like a dream. I saw the pink colored snow there. Sometimes when we risk a great danger, it turns into a great experience.  ",30
22," 16.12.00 Dear Clark, I am writing to response to the international Arsts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you, that it was a great idea and  valuable activitie as a social event. However, it was a dissapointment, when I realised that not many countries were attending to the event. I could be fine if I had seen more countries from all around the world, for instance:  far east, indonesia etc. It wasn't complicated to find the right hall to the shows, I should say it was very well organised. But one thing, I have to mention is that some of the concert halls was too small and it wasn't comfortable as well as to fell the great atmosphere. On the other side, I enjoyed to being on of the people to see the plays and films,  dance shows which was brillantly performed -  art exbitions. Listening  talks by the famous writers was a opportunity which I couldn't missed. I would like to ask, if you could expend the plays and films more for next year? I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to sell all the events. Finally, I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival.  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Nico, Its really nice to hearing from you and thank you very much for the letter with photos. Its a good idea to send them to me, because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films. What a pitty! By the way how is your new school? Did you like it more than the previous one? I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have  more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons. On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol. I have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks. My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up! But in many Families women are doing more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together. Anyway it think that's it for now. I hope to hearing from you soon. Lots of Love ",24
195," Dear Sir/Madam I want to complain about your advertisment about the theatre 'Over the Rainbow' I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show, but he wasn't. Secondly the show didn't start until 20:15 but it should have started  19:30 so we had to sit and wait which was very boring. There were no discounts on the ticket available either. After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed because rebuilding. In the advertisement it says ""your perfect evening out"" but it was a real disappointment. I would like to have the money back that I spent on the tickets I bought. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours Faithfully Svetlana  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She had always been like that, said my best friend Ann to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret yesterday. The secret was that I was in love with Peter in my course. I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone. Yesterday when I arrived to the college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strange at me and laufhing. I felt how I started to blush. In the classroom it became even worser. People started to whrite things on the board and pointing at me. In the lunchbreak I went to Pat and asked her why she had told him the secret, but she just ignored me like she didn't know me. After that I never went back to the course again. ",35
775," Dear Sir, I was very happy when your letter arrived, yesterday. This trip will be very important for me, that is why I am interested in travelling to  U.S.A as soon as possible. I would like to travel on July because I will be on  winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school. I would really prefer to stay in  tents because I love sleeping outdoors and listening   noises from outside. I am going to tell you two activities that I would like to do while I will be at the Camp. Firstly I would be happy if you let me play tennis, because I have played it for four years and I do it well, and secondly I believe that singing could be interesting because I really like it and I have a beautiful voice. I was wondering  the kind of clothes that I will have to wear and finally could you tell me how much money I will have to take? I look for ward to receiving more news. Yours Faithfully, Rosario de los Peines (Mrs).  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! How are you? I'm writing because I know that you're interested in listening  my experience in which I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, perhaps in the future you'll be able to help too. If you want to help at a pop concert you'll have to write down yourself in a competition as I did, then, if you win the organiser will phone you and you'll be able to help them. At the concert I had to clear and organized all the people who were in, but at the end of the night I was able to talk with one of my favourite pop singer. I think that it was the experience I particularly liked most and which I will never forget. Looking forward to hearing from you. Love, ",26
525," Dear Sir/Madam, I would like to point out the problems  when I went to watch your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at the Circle Theatre. On your advertisement, you have written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I have expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing. Also, the times printed on your advertisment was 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late. On your advertisment, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available. I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and on your advertisment, it made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting. However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated. It was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisment said it would be, and I would like some refund back. I hope you would give these problems your immediate attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind  not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever? When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends. I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce. When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day,  to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse. However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and  told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager. My happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car. The news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover. I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now. I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret. ",39
255," Mr. Maneger, In this unconfortable situation I am writting to tell you about some irratable problems. I went today to see Over the Rainbow, and I am very disappointed with the organisation of your theatre. First of all, when I went to buy my tickets I discovered that the advertisement was saying false things because there wasn't any discount available, but in anyway I bought the ticket. Then, the time marked to the beginning  was 19:30 and unfortunatly he began at 20:15. I have already, saw others versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, who ended with the musical. Closing this facts, when the musical finished I was very , in the fact of the wainting for the start of the musical and  dissapointed with this version of Over the Rainbow, every body went to the restaurant wich is closed without any explanation. I am very dissapointed with this evening and with the desorganized way of deal with problems so I am asking  my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He has a bestfriend, that was more like a brother for him. They always done thing together, and they were the most popular boys in school, both were very hanson, played football they were the example for everybody. Before one day, when Pat discovered that his brother was gay, after this their relationship has change. Pat was very frightened with this situation. Pat and Ted, had always competition, and Ted used to be the best, he never had failed and people in general constums to like more Ted, I don't now why. This secret was an opportunity for Pat be the best without  competition but it is a secret who involved his best friend sexuality, and if Ted was a normal person it will be fine but he was the example for all  school. Unable to keep a secret he told for everyone, ended his friendship with Ted, now Ted is rejective for everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honestity. I  prefer be nothing than bun like Pat ",20
1061," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you to complain about  three days programme. Thank you very much for your good programme,  especially for  visiting  The National Art Gallery. All our class like to see the beautiful pictures which were drawn by brilliant artists and painters. We saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and our class would like to go to the show. It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or go shopping. Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have a free time. So on this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and even hair styles. All our class and me would like to see this show. You know what else? We don't need to pay, it's for free because we are students. It's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rare. I think you'll agree that we have changed your programme. As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having a free time. I'm looking forward of recieving a letter from you. Thank you very much. Bye  [SEP]  Hello I'm going to write about ""The Home of the Future"". We can't say straight away how the people's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create the unbelievable things about future life. Of course there will be differences between todays homes and the future ones. I think the houses will grow up on twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy it. I think more and more people will have at least one flat,  doesn't matter if you are rich or not. The rooms will be designed in a future fashion like less furniture and everything is compact, even TV-set will be on the ciling. The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even  swiching on the light by saying only; ""light"". If course if you have enough money to let your self live in such  apartments, then you can afford it. Now what's going to be the same. Well as I said if you're poor, the government still give you the flat but  very ugly one, probably with rats in it. The same problem will be with homeless people who doesn't have money at all, even to buy a food for themselves. They will have to stay on the streets as  streets is their home. I hope and I wish that the future will bring us a good moments of life where everybody will have  home and a warm, friendly family relationships. Bye. ",25
698," 13/6/00 To whom it may concern, I have recently received a letter saying I am a first-prize winner for your competition. I was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details. I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and is the most convenient time for me. At Camp California, I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable. The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing. I think they are a good contrast. I have not done sailing for quite a long time so I might find it difficult but I am looking forward to it. As well as a good exercise, I would also  be able to learn something new. I have never done Photography before. I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings. I would appreciate it if you also advise me on how much money I should take. It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before. Please send me additional information soon. Thank you for your time and your kind effort. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  When you think of the word 'shopping' a smile always comes onto your face. Shopping is thought of as enjoyable. Teenagers go shopping for leisure and to socialize. There are more than one kind of shopping though and one particular kind is window-shopping. I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up at a high street to go shopping. For me, that was window-shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew thought that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway. I went back everyday just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money. When I received my monthly pay, I rushed down to the shop and without thinking, bought that dress. I went back to where I was before - with no money (and a black dress) all over again. When I think about it now, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",39
736," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am so glad. I have won first prize in your competition! It was a really big surprise for me. I will join The Camp California in the U.S.A. with pleasure. I would like to travel there in July, because only in July I can have holiday. In June and in August I will have to work, so it would be rather impossible for me to join Camp California then. I would like to have an accomodation in  log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent. So if I could choose I would like to stay in a log cabin. Being at the Camp I would like to swim and to play tennis. I have swam for 10 years and I have played tennis since I was 9 years old and those activities I like best. I thin I am the best in horse riding; I even have my own horse, so if it is possible I would like to ride horses at Camp California. I am looking forward for hearing from you. Yours sincerely Felicia Zajac  [SEP]  It was a bright, shinny day. I woke up early in the morning and I decided to go shopping. Warsaw's ,, Clif'' is my favourite shopping centre so I went there. I saw a beautiful, long dress. I decided to try it on. - What is your size - said  shop-assistant. - 36 - I said. - Och, I am very sorry, but we have run out of 36 size. I was going to the chemist to buy some eye-shadow, when I saw black, suede shoes. Those shoes must be mine! - I thought. I went in and I asked the shop assistant if I could try it on. - Yes, of course- she replied- but what is your size? - 38 - I said. - I'am very sorry but we do not have 38. I was very angry. I had some money, I wanted to spend them, but?! Everything did not suit me! It was enough! I came back home - tired and angry. Surely it was not the best day for shopping. I did not buy anything, although I tried. So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoable. ",27
278," Dear Sir/madam I am writing with regard to your advertisment. During my 2 week's holiday I would like to attend a musical show. It was my favorite play. I was very hopefull that I was going to have a good time. But there were many things which went wrong. Firstly, I have had no discount at paying. secondly there was  delay which got me into trouble, After the show I couldn't catch my train. Because I didn't have any plan I decided to have a lunch in  theatre restaurant. But it was closed. The worst thing is that I couldn't watch my favorite actor. I was so dissapointted with that. I couldn't consentrate on the play any more. Contrary to the advertisment everything was disapointing. I regret  to demand all my expenses . I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible situation. I am waiting for a satisfactory answer Yours faithfully Azami  [SEP]  Technology has developed increasingly in recent years. As a result of this our society has changed a lot. On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier. On the other hand we have faced some problems, such as social and environmental problems. Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before. Although in those days the only way of learning was reading. These days we can use  computer, television and some sophisticated equipment. which were unusuall before. Than to technology we can reach any place in the world easily. We can get some information more quickly. Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well. Children play wit computer instead of  usuall plays. Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively. There has been  change  relatinships between people. People are getting more and more lonely. We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years. While we are using technology, we should take into consideration  environment. We shouldn't allow to be exploited the world. If we want to leave a good world to the next generations, we should behave more respectfully againgst the nature. ",27
1213," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to answering our question. Firstly, I already have booked  Palace Hotel for the students. There is the hotel near my college. It takes five minutes to get  my college by walking. I will copy the map around the college. Secondly, I will tell you about the end-of-conference party. It will start at six o'clock. The party will be held in the dinning room. People who will attend the party are many professers, semi-professers and faculties. So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes. Finally, I will give you some ideas for an afternoon free time. The city in which there is my college is traditional in my country. For example, there are many shrines, temples, and castles. I suggest that you should visit these places. You will have a good time. In addition, there are many other colleges. You will be able to see many Japanese students. I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. If you would like to gain more information, you will ask me everytime. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  I suggest that you should visit one building. My town is the capital of Japan. So there are many higher buildings. I think it is like New York. However, I have only one building which I want you to visit. The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60'. This is the highest building in Tokyo. I recommend to visit . I have three reasons for my recommendation. Firstly, there is the acquerium in the building. In addition, this is the 60th floor,  I went there  first time I couldn't believed it. Secondly, if you visit there, you will see everywhere in Tokyo. The scene of Tokyo is not beautiful, but you think that this city is a developing place. On the other hand you may think what a small city it is!! Finally, there are many shops inside the building. You will have a good time for shopping. I hope when you visit, you will be favorite place. You should visit there. ",24
445," Dear Sir, I have come to watch the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' in the Circle Theatre. I was really disappointed because a lot of things were not done. I will explain these now and want to ask to get some of the money I have given you back. It was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show. Danny Brook was not there, a different actor was in his place. That was very disappointing for me. The musical show was going to start at 19.30, but it started t 20:15. We have waited for 45 minutes getting bored for it to start! When I went to buy tickets, they didn't accept the discounts. But I had read that the discounts were available. Like it was written again, we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed. They said that the time was late and they wanted to go home. There was nothing for us to do, the show started 45 minutes later. Now, I think that you have seen it was not a perfect evening at all, a lot of  things written were not done So I am asking to get some of my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  DAILY LIFE - MODERN TECHNOLOGY MY daily life. I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do. I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost in  Internet. etc. Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it in a normal day, but when I sit and think, its everywhere! For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example for modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at last! TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels. Now it's colourful and there are many channels on TV. You watch whichever you want. I can't think that I watch the same channels every day. A wonderful example for modern technology:  Computer! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most of the people. And  Internet. You can look for everything you want. You can talk to every people living all around the world. You don't understand the time passing when you are in that world. You can have information about all the things,  go everywhere. Everything is near you. You can reach them whenever you want! You see, our daily life consists of modern technology. It would be hard to live without it. ",27
289," Dear manager I went to the theatre to see a musical show ""Over the rainbow"" and had a very disappointing evening. According to your advertisement, the actor should be Danny Brook, but infact it was  different person. My ticket was for 19.30, but it started very late, it started  20:15. When the show finished, it was too late to catch the train to home. I had to take  taxi. It costed me £30. ""What a waste!,, By the way, I didn't see any discounts for buying tickets. One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I get there for a glass of drink, I don't know why, there was no written notes or information about that. I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out. Would you consider to give  my money back? If the refund is available, it would be grateful. I would look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is one of my colleges in the office. She works with me. We get on very well. She is a single mum. She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understandable. Last week, I missed work on Tuesday, so Pat had to work harder because she was all alone. I appreciated her and she wouldn't mind. I told her the reason that I had to miss the work. My son was in prison. I had to go and see him. I still don't know how it really happens to him. All I know is  about drug smuggling,  that he  involved. I asked to her not to tell anyone, because I didn't want others know about this. I am  very private person. Yesterday morning, I went to  toilet, I overherd two people talking about my son I felt pity on myself and I burst into tears. I quickly got out of  toilet. I don't remember how I finished work that day. Nowadays, it is hard to trust people. No one is perfect. Everybody make mistakes. I decided to forgive my friend Pat. ",28
906," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you for the amazing inform about the competition. I am really glad to be able to win the first prize and travel to the U.S.A. which I used to dream . Now, I would like to reply  some questions you need, willingly. At first, I would like to travel only in July because I study at University at the moment. However, they will give me such a long holiday enough to travel for two weeks in June. I would prefer staying  tents to log cabins, as I'd like to observe nature and stay in outdoor as much time as I can. I'm very happy with the activities you organised. I am good at playing basketball, swimming, tennis, surfing as they are my hobbies for donkey's years. I would rather play golf and go sailing, than the others so as to find new hobbies in my life. Finally, what I would like to ask is what sort of cloths are suitable for the travelling, and also, how much money I should prepare for the travelling, approximately. I would be grateful if you could reply  my letter with some further information soon. Yours sincerely Takashi Oshima.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you going these days? I'm fine as usual. Anyway, I joined the team which helps anything at a pop concert last month as you know. In my view, it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long. Talking of my work, I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows. If you choose the post, you would be exhausted throughlly in the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby. Although I can not explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter, I'd like to recomend you to help at a pop concert or the other. It must be a good experience and a special memory for you. See you and write  me soon. Best Wishes ",23
1141," Dear Mrs Brown, I am writing in connection with a surprise birthday party for your husband, Mr. Brown. We are writing to invite you and to give you some information about the party. All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him. The party in on Tuesday 16 of June. You should come on 3 pm in  college Canteen. We have bought some snaks to eat and three students will sing for him, also. Besides this, we have invited all  other teachers and the Principal of our school. Of course all the class will take party to this party. Furthermore, we don't know what present buying for him. So we would appreciate  if you  help us with this matter. We have thought  to buy a cd or a book. He loves to read books. What do you believe? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon especially as I am concerned about this matter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays people's life has many problems which need some solutions. Especially younger's life has been very difficult  the last  years. The only appropriate  to solve people's problems is the family. Teenagers usually think about a matter which is drugs. Their family could explain  them how they avoid things. They know the way to do this. And the way is love. Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children with difficulties of school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend. On the other hand, friends are not suitable  to do this. Definately, they don't give real solutions and advice. There is a chance  not to be so good friends and imitate that they are. The way  which  family comes in contact with the members so easily is love. So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions of our problems. ",29
225," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complaine about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting ""Over the Rainbow"". It wasn't at all like what the advertisement for the show had promised. I will try to explain below: To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well. Then, they were not any discounts available for the tickets as it was written on the advertisement. What's more the theatre restaurant was closed for some reasons and we couldn't get anything to drink or eat after the show. On top of everything Danny Brook, the star of the night, was absent and his role was performed by a different actor. You can understand how disappointing this was for all of us. I am sorry but this wasn't my perfect evening out. I would like to ask for some refund because the whole evening was very disappointing and it did not worth the money given Yours faithfully  [SEP]  As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes rootly through the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be like 100 years from now In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns to be stricher and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too. This is how I think  fashion of the future will be like. The most exciting  about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange  as we don't think about ours . ",30
34," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment, I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and  some suggestions for next year's festival that you might take in consideration. The International Arts Festival is a beautiful idea. I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money. In your advertisment you mentionned that there is artists and stars from all around the world coming, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented. I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the Festival if it is possible. It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kind of music and to discover different culture. Hoping that I did not offend you in any ways and that you might take in consideration my suggestion, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide. The night he came into this world, was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born, it was a casual night. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land. Only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born. When the three men saw him they fell on their knees to worship him. The mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins. This little man from Israel died as the  hero of all times. His message is still as impacting today and will always be even if this story happened a long time ago. ",26
1185," Dear Mrs Smith, I am glad to helping you for the organisation of the international student conference. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube, the building of the conference is then five minutes by footh. At the end-of-conference there is a party, where we can eat something, dance and speak to each other about the conference. For the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes; maybe something black and not red or pink. I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it can be that this information give you some idea too.. On the last day we are going to have about three hours free times. What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum? Of if we will go to hear a classic concert near the conference building's? I hope that I have been able to give you some help. and I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Morgan, I am writing a report,  which  will describe  you the most important building of my town. The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"". It is an old big house of a rich lord in the middle of the town. Into this house there is a big museum, where you could know  the past of Biasco. Under the museum there is a big dark place, where the wine is produced. Your American students could learn how the ,,Meriot ticinese"" is produced and why is it so famous in Tiano. I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco, with its ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"", is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too. I hope that these informations will bring you to visit Biasco and its ,,house"". Yours faithfully, ",26
262," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the show, ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw in your theatre last week. I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected. First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor. However, he was not on the stage that day. Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything. It was a waste of time. I also thought that there should have been discounts for students, which in fact was not available and I had to pay for  normal price. Furthur more, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay. I had to go home without eating a dinner, though I was really hungry. I have to say that the evening was terrible. If I had known all of them, I would have changed my plan and could have a better time. I strongly suggest you should give us  right information. I also would like to claim some refund for the evening. I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion in 100 years If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them. People have become more informal, casual and practical than before. But how about the fashion of the future, for example, 100 years from now? I think it'll also be very different from now. But in which way? First of all, people might think more about the function of clothes than the design. For example, they'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution, sunshine etc. Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses, and that all the masks are designers brands, which are made of  special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air. It's like a joke, but a bit scarely. Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from  sun-burn, and it's the most trendy fashion of the year! It's funny. But we never know!! ",32
319," Dear Mrs/Mis Last night I went to your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" and I would like to tell you that it wasn't what I expected to see. Actually this happened because the most things I saw were differend from what the advertisement had been written. First of all it had been written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring, but Danny wasn't there and somebody else took his place. This was the most disappointing thing I herd. Also you wrote that the show it was going to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. You ought to know that all the people hated to wait and started  the complains. The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open, because the owners were for holidays. At last you wrote that it was our perfect evening out, but like I said before it wasn't. Actually it was terrible and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to taking your answer Yours senciarly   [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After we had had an argument she told all the school my secrets. She had really let me down. I met her before a year and from the first time we talk to each other we became friends. It took us a few time to became best friend and after that we were always together. Every day after school she went to my house or I went to hers. Always we were laughing and having  great time. I loved her a lot and I thought she felt the same about me, but I had wrong. Anyway, always I trust her  my secrets, because I was sure she wouldn't tell them to other people, even if some say we would be apart. But I was wrong again. One day, we went to a party, where she met some of the most pobular girls in the school. She started to act like them and speak like them. When I told her, she became very angry. and she left without saying nothing. After when I saw her, she laught at me and the next day all the school knew everything about me. I started to cry but later I got over it Now the only thing I care  is that she couldn't keep secrets and all the school is looking down on me. ",24
178," Dear Madam/Sir, I'm writting to you to explain my problem that I have had in your theatre. I recentely had a week's holiday in London, and during my stay, I went in your theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because I have seen an advertisement about this show and I was really interrested  to see it for many reasons, one of this reasons it is that I love the starring Danny Brook. And I would like that you know that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook. Secondly, in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reallity the show has started at 20:15 and the discount was not available. Finally, I wanted to visit you theatre restaurant after the show but it was already closed. So, I had a very disappointing evening and it would be very kind of you if you give me back the money . I'am looking forward to hear  you as soon as possible. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think it is very good to have a science and technology because it can really affects our lives. For example 20 years ago, people who were affected by the AIDS Virus couldn't live more than two or three years, but now with the new science, there is several therapi and now people affected by this virus can live many years. I think you can do a lot  of think now than before with the techonology. You can travel around the world by train, by plane or by ship and maybe one day you can fly by car. Why not. I hope that you will find this composition interesting. best reguard. ",22
617," Dear Mrs Ryan It was a grate pleasure to hearing from you, that I have won first prize in your competition. I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but even though I would like to know how much money do I have to take with me. I would be glad to travel only in July because of family reasons. Other point is accommodation. I would be more than happy if you could have provided me with  tent. The reasons as following;  better relationship with nature, and  grate opportunity to improve my health. Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to chose and why. I like swimming and photography because it will be very interesting to improve my skills at both activities. The last thing I would like to know is which clothes do I have to take, even though the weathe in July will be good. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but a few of us who is very happy to spend money. Money is a very important thing in shopping, if you have money,  is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagen that your credit card is not working, or some one stold your cash from your pocket. We will say  unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapt. Staying in a que or croude is also unplesent. All  people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need. After words you are tiered and have no power to do things. After all  things that I have mentioned it is clearly seen that shopping is not enjoyable. ",24
508," Dear Sir I write a letter to complain about your advertisement about the musical show ""over the rainbow"", wich is misleading in a number of way. Firstly we arrived at 19.15 to be in time for the show, which should have started at 19.30. However it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed. Furthermore, it's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reason to why we went. Imagine how disappointed we got when we found out that he had been replaced. Besides, when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discounting was available. Unfortunately, it wasn't and we couldn't afford bying everyone a ticket. Finally, after the show we had planed to eat diner at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to  closed. Therefor, as you may understand I'm asking for a refund. These kinds of misadventures can easily ruin your reputation. I look forward to hearing from you Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and the rumours describing me stealing soon reached the director's office. I was send a letter in which it was written that the director wanted to meet me and my parents. Sweating and affraid I waited out side the director's office the following day. I was unable to image what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen. 'You may enter' said the director. Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen. I was suprised that my father didn't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me. Mother, on the other hand, looked at me and seemed both disappointed and betrayed. During the trip home non of us spoke. We just sat calmly waiting for this nightmare to be over. The same evening my father pronounced a few words: 'May this be the end of your thief career we are only ready to forgive if you promiss never to start again'  ",28
113," Manager of the Circle Theatre 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show ""over the Rainbow"" you presented  the 10 of this month. I read your advertissement five days before, and I was realy impressed by it. But, the quality of this show wasn't what you let understand, an I feel realy disappointed by it. I want to give you some details about my feelings. First of all, you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late. Then, I am a student, and when I bought my ticket, there wasn't any discounts. Finally, I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make my totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00. So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending ""Perfect Evening"". For all these reasons, and if you want to keep me  a costumer, I would be gratfull if you give me some or all  my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My marks wasn't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science, and the exam session was finished. There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma. You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story. In fact, I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming. The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam to succeed. That's why I decided to hack  the teacher's computers to change all my marks. I never talked about this project to anyone, exept my best friend Pat. At the end of the exam session, all students and teachers meet together for a big party, to celebrate it. During this party, Pat drank too much. And when he was totally drunk, he started speaking. Then, the teachers made copies of their file, and my project wasn't possible anymore. So congratulation everybody. And I think I will still be there next year. ",23
531," To the manger of the Circle Theatre Mr Smith Caen, Saturday June 17th Mr Smith, I have recently been to London on a holiday trip so I decided to spend my free-time going to the musical show you were advertising for. It seemed very attractive and the different informations on the ad pushed me into going to it. Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars Mr Smith and I think that you've lied to such naive tourist like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part and we only had different and pityful ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of forty-five minutes. It is a shame! I ought not to talk about the restaurant  closed for no apparent reasons You had promised a perfect evening but I spend an horrible one  and you ruined my holiday! What are you mistaken us for, Mr Smith? Foolish idiots? We did not deserve such  bad show. That's why I want my money back! Now! Otherweise I'll have to put some others ads  in London saying that your show is just a fake!  [SEP]  How modern technology changed your daily life! To begin with, I'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the  economic prosperity many goods like TV, washing-machine, etc. became cheaper and available. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite  seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life? As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influence me is in my work: the internet has become such an incredible tool, I can make research about everything I want, find informations for lectures for example or exercices. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge. Nevertheless, new technology has made me become more lazy. I spend a lot of  free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing  the computer. Maybe it  change me into a kind of self-centered person, a loner. But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in  way  to communicate. It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent. I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone. But we should not forget that it's only tools and  emphazise human relationships. ",23
967," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have won the first prize! I am extremly happy about this. I am writing because of same information that you need. I have only the possibility to take  holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginn of August. Of course I would like to stay in a tent. When I was a child we were often camping. To stay in a tent will remind my of a unforgottable time. There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes  hard to choose only two. Given the circumstances I would like to learn more about Photograhy and Painting. I have same skills in drawing landscape but I have no idea about photography. Taking picture is a new experience for me. I have never been I California. How is the weather there in July? What kind of clothes would you recommend taking with me? Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I prefer to take traveller queckes? I am glad to hear from you. Yours faithfully Artemis  [SEP]  Hi Kim, How are you doing? I couldn't write  you because I was very busy. Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my town. I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hopped to see a lot of diffrent people. You know everybody has to cross this spot! Given the circumstances they asked my for helping in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out as a funny and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal. It means I had to read the recipies very carefully. And I had to controll that nothing will be missed. The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks. On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored. The people were all really funny and we were a good team. The time was quickly over and it was a great experience. And what about you? I am interested to hear about your new dog? Warm whishes Your friend, Artemis ",26
752," Dear Madam Ryan, I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. It is a wonderful surprise. I can go to the Camp California only in July, because I have school in June and I must work in my father's bookshop in August. At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience in this sport, because I played tennis during seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted. I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take (if it is going to  rainy or to be sunny) and how much money I must have with me. Could you tell me what sort of material I will have to bring to do the activities? Yours sincerely Odette Douai Luna  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Do you know last week I have been to a pop concert to help my uncle, who is the director of the stadium of Lugano. It was very interresting, because I did different things. I cooked a meal for the artists, I spoke with the manager of Bruce Springsteen and I helped a technician to install his material: the lights. The best part of the day was after the concert, when I met the group ""U2"". I was very excited, because this is my favourite group: I'm always hearing  their songs. I took some photographies and I'll show them to you when you come next week I had a talk with Santana, the best guitarist in the world, too. He's quite old, but very attractive. I would like playing guitar like him. What a great day it was. The next concert is on 19th June and I will be here. See you soon. Yours Odette ",32
859," Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice letter which informed me   to have won first prize in my competition. I'am really surprising and happy about it. In your letter you needed  some informations about me. Unfortunately, I have only the possibility to travel in July because in August I will start a new job for six months. I won't be free, however all July I am at home. For accommodations at this camp, I would prefer being in a tent to being in a log cabin. It is more amusing and friendly. It will allow me to make friends more quickly. Two of my best activities are swimming and photography. The first one  is a needless for me. I go every day swimming  one Mile. The last summer I won a prize in competition of swimming. The second one is more  a hobby. I like go in nature and make photography. I started it two months ago. I don't have any material. Could you tell me if you would lend me some material for photography? What sort of clothes will I need for these two weeks? How much money will I take with me? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Henri Devereux  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm so happy with the experience I lived last month. I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month. I was really great. Firstly I was designed to sell the tickets. I was already happy to help in such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer's concert. I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge. They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe. It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer. Are you thinking? I was so exciting! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager John and her musicians.  All were very kindly and pleasant. It was a big moment for me. Finally these people are like us, they have just a special job with special times. The next year, if it will be possible, I would like go back with you. They will organise a same concert pop but with an other singer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love, Henri ",23
726," 13, June, 2000 To Helen Ryan, Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you for the letter. I got it today and couldn't believe it! As you asked me for some further information. I will write it down. I'd like to travel in July and this is the only time I can travel, because I am busy with a school project until the end of June and I am  to work in a hospital for the summer holidays in August and September. For accommodation, I prefer log cabins, because I believe I can meet more people if I stay in log cabins and it's a lot of fun to talk with them. I'd like to play tennis and basketball while I am there. I have never played basketball, but I have played tennis for 6 years and I am a good player. I have never traveled abroad and don't know if I should bring a credit card with me. If you have suggestions, can you write to me again? Thank you again and take care, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  13 June, 2000. Dear Kim, Hi! How are you doing? I'm fine. As you asked me about the concert, I'll write about it today. First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took  long  to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get to excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans. By the time it finished, I was exhausted, but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free! Have you had an interesting experience? Please write about it in the next letter. I hope to hear from you soon. Yours ",33
283," Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about your musical show which I saw last Saturday. According to your advertisement, one of the stars was supposed to be Danny Brook. However, a different actor play the role instead of him. You can imagine how upset I felt, as I really wanted to see his performance. To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start from 7:30 p.m, it started from 8:15 p.m. What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off. On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available. I was really disappointed at your show. I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and  discomfort which I suffered. I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In these days, young people prefer wearing shabby and scruffy clothes to wearing neat and tidy clothes. In other words, their fashion has become more casual. I think this tendancy will become more common in the future. In general, their parents don't like their fashion. They want their children to wear clothes neatly. When they were young, they judged the other person by his appearance. They also were asked to wear clothes which was in accordance with the occasion. In my opinion, this is still correct. However, people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind. If someone doesn't have enough knowledge about the event which he attends, even if he wears clothes neatly, he doesn't look like a gentleman. What I want to say is that people don't mind their clothes if he has enough knowledge about what he needs. To sum up, people can wear clothes more freely, in the future. What is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everthing including fashion. ",31
883," Dear Sir or Madam, I have received your letter about the prize I have won in your competition. I would like to thank you and give some   information you asked about me. Re  time: I am a student and have examinations until the end of June. The only convinient time to travel is in July. I hope you can arrange this. Re accommodation: I would like to stay in a log cabin. I have had sleeping and breathing problems in tents which were serious. I hope to avoid these this time. Re activities: During the two weeks I would like to do tennis and swimming. I regularly play tennis since I was nine years old and I entered several competitions. Swimming is another sport I learned when I was six. I have a few questions about the camp. Are the meals free or do I have to pay for it? Do you have a choice of food? I'm vegetarian and can't eat any milk products. What kind of clothes will I need? Are there any special clothes you suggest? I'm looking forward to your reply Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I'm glad to hear that you have found a job. I want to apologize for writing so late, but I had a lot of work to do. Do you remember the concert I helped at. It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 am. to let them in the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exactly number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my place and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and couts of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things  with them, like knifes or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard. It was a great experience. I had a serious duty and also a lot of fun. I met new people which I still see. I would like to introduce them to you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",39
986," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote  me asking for my preferences about the Camp. About the information you needed, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, because of work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in  tents, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a boyscout and go against the routine. From the list of activities you sent me, I stay with the, from my point of view, most relaxing activities available: painting and photography. One of my hobbies is the photography, so I think I am rather good at it, but I will take painting only to learn, because I am not very talentive at it. I also would like to know if I have to take  money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location. Please reply  soon. Yours sincerely David Brian  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! A couple of months ago, I was told that Britney Spears was coming to perform in our city. When I knew this, I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepares the stage during the concert. I was really excited. The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle. And I didn't even got paid. But it was worthy. I found my reward when the concert finished. After been carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was eshausted. But when Britney came out of the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write  me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me. Bye. With love David Brian ",32
203," To the manager, Lately, I had the oportunity to go to yours Circle Theatre event. Unfortunatly I never thought it could be so dissapointing. It started when I received the advertisement on the street. According to that, I thought I'd have a wonderful night. The first problem happened at the box office because there were abosolutly no discounts available. Well, I bought a the ticket anyway. The show supposed to start at 19:30 but it actually started forty five minutes after it. When the show began  had my biggest disappoint, instead of the great Danny Brook, there were another actor, totally unknown. After the show I was so nervous about the whole thing that I decided to eat at the restaurant and try to relax a little. From my surprise, it was closed. According to all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly one of the worsts. I'd like so, to reiceve my money back. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Techology is always getting better. And it is responsable for many changes in my life, and I think I wouldn't be able to live without it anymore. Nowaday, with  Internet it had became easier to do the school works and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favorite football team. I also got recently a celular phone and I don't now  I lived so long without one - because it help to solve the problems so quickly, it's really amazing. But for me, the best thing is definatly the microwaver. And there is a quite good reason for it. I live alone, so I have to cook my own food, and I'm the worst cooker in the whole world. There are some of the   modern techonologys that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me. ",28
14," To: From: I spent two days at  annual international arts festival from 21 to 22 of November. This festival was well-orginised. There were a lot of activities for everyone. I relly liked  exhibitions. I had a chance to see amazing pictures with wezy painted by Russian painters. There was an excellent jazz concert. The Band ""Three Kings"" apresented  new stily of music. I would like to notice that a dance show was absolutelly marvelous. What's a greit idea to invite writers there! I relly liked to speak with them. From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and  there were artist from only six countries. Nowadays many people  fond of classical music, but this concert was too small that's why many people had to miss this classical concert. You wrote an advertisment  that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists only from 6 countries. It was relly  pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy. The International Arts Festival was organised quite well. I would only recomended you to have more artists and a classical concert should be in  bigger hall than it was.  [SEP]  One man and one woman lived in  small house beside the sea. There names were Ivan and Maria. They were so pour that somitimes they hardly had something to eat. One day Ivan caught a fish. It wasn't  usual fish, it was  Gold Fish and it asked him as  human; ' Please, let me go and I can do for you anything you want'. But Ivan was so kind person that he let Gold Fish went without  any condition. Afterwards he came back home. He told her wife about this story. She was angry and she said that Ivan was just  foolish man. She persuide him to go to the sea to ask  a lot of things for her. Ivan had to do what she said. Gold Fish did everything what Ivan asked. When he come back home, he was surprise because Maria was more angry than before. She said that it wasn't enough what Gold Fish had done for her. Ivan had to beg Gold Fish again and again. In the end, greedy Maria wanted impossible thing. She said that Ivan should bring Gold Fish to home and Ivan could leave this house because she didn't need him anymore. Maria wanted too much and Gold Fish returned everything at the beginning. Maria and Ivan were again poor.  This story happened a long time ago. ",24
74," Dear Mrs Jane Clark I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with  International Arts Festival, which was organised by you last year. However I think that International Arts Festival is a great idea and I suggest you prepare it better. Firstly, it was written on the advertisment that there would be stars and artist from around the world I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artist from only six countries and in my opinion there should be more. Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls, which in my opinion were too small. That was the reason why some people were complaining. Thirdly, I suggest you should put more plays and films  next year, because watching them is a very nice way of spending our freetime. Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea about giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was excelent because it attracted peoples' attention Lastly, I'd like to give you a piece of advice. I suggest you invite some film stars, because they are very famous and people like them I hope you'll look into these matters and improve the festival next year. I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make the world go round, so they always look for a job with  big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it. In my opinion the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities  to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get  well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated. They have to think about some season jobs. Firstly, the good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are not able to do  shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and  permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are  good mathematic you can be a seller. Thirdly if you are good looking you can apply for a job in  restaurant and become  waiter. Maybe you'll not get a big salary but think about the tips, which in the posh restaurants are very high. Lastly, if you like playing instruments and you don't like working you can go busking. If you are  good musician you will get a lot of money. ",30
1158," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I have just received a letter from you. I am really appreciate your interesting about our conference. Firstly, the Palace hotel is your accommodation which you have booked. This is  very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased with staying there. Secondly, you will have no problems finding the conference. Obviously, using a taxi is the best but unfortunately it is quite expensive for  student. However, we have already prepared a mini-bus for you. The bus will be in front of your hotel at 1 p.m. and it will take you to the conference. Thirdly, we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have prepared for 3 months. But I hope you will wear  formal suit and dress. You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes. Lastly, you do not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attraction. Cambridge bus tour, for example, will be very nice time for you because it is the best and the easiest way of knowing Cambridge. But if you do not like it, you can enjoy  City centre by  walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge. I hope you will be happy with our conference and party and etc. We have prepared all of them for a long time. Please oblige us with your attendance. If you want more information, please let me know.

I will tell you some information about this building. This building consists of a world exposition centre, a multiplex cinema, a huge shopping mall, a huge food court and an aquarium.

839," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter and congratulations! I have always been interested in visiting other contries. In fact it didn't want to ask my parents for money, and going on holiday with you would be an ideal solution. I will be having my exams durind this month, so I can't travel before July. Also I'm going to meet a director of Smith'th Travel Agency for  interview concerning possible work with English-speaking tourists. As you can see, I will be available only in July. As regards accommodation, I would like to stay in tents, because I used to going on holiday with my friends and staying in tents. It is just wonderful. In my spare time I like to play basketball for a local team of which I have recently been made captain. I would now like to learn how to play tennis and golf, if it is possible. Could you please let me know what kind of weather will be there in July, what sorts of clothing I'd better take with me. Is there an extra charge for some trips, which might put them beyond my means. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Raisa Sharapova  [SEP]  To: Dinara Safina From: Raisa Re: Daily life at our school. As requested, it has collected some information about the school. Below is a summary of the most important relevent points with some recommendations. 1. The fully-equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are no enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increase the number of them, because it will be more exiting to film. 2. The school arranges an amasing range of activities, such as excuintions, sports and different kinds of trips. Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the most funny events happen while we are playing basketball and football. I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video. Conclusion. Our school is an ideal place for making a short video. There are many interesting lessons and other activities. I do recommend, however, to make a short video about a) lessons in the computer centre b) basketball and football games. ",34
544," Dear Sir/Madam! Thank you very much for your letter. I was surprised because I didn't expect that I could win. Now I study and I'll continue my study untill the end of June. Then I'll have  holiday which finish in August. That's why I'd like to travel only in July. I prefer to live in  log cabin because I think it's more comfortable. There are warmer and drier and I'm afraid of insects and spiders. It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest  time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where  in the lake or swimming-pool. I think it's  very usefull and helpful thing for my health especially when I do it with pleasure. The second  my favorit sport is tennis. I've played tennis for ten years I'm a profesional and I have to be good at it, in any time. I want to ask you about money. How much money  I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card. Could you let me know about the weather because I don't know what kind of clothes I should take. Would you send me your answer as fast as it  possible. I look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you Yours faithfully Katerina Petrov  [SEP]  Hi, Kim! How are you? I'm fine soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward for them but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot. Now I want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advices about suits and dresses. Often we looked repetitions and if something didn't like us we tried to correct it. The most enjoable thing was to smart people. We have a good and rich sponsor, that's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style. We always explained  them and at the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loud  audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. You should try it and feel. I'll be waiting for your answer. Best wishes. Katerina. ",24
199," Dear Sir/Madame, I am writing to complain about your musical show which  performed last Friday. I was interested in your advertisement and I booked the friday show while I had been on holiday. However, this theatre made me disappointing from starting the show until  finishing. First of all, I saw that the discounts were available, but there were not any discounts and advantages for the audience. Also the show started at 20:15 delaying for more 45 minutes than the advertise mentioned. I could bare it by the time. Moreover the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but he actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed by the excuse  to be repaired. In fact, the notice had been showed since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people. In conclusion, I was very disappointed in a whole of the show, furthermore, I could not enjoy my holiday after the show. Therefore, I would like  to refund some money. I look forward to recieving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully, Sun-Young Lee.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Return to the Nature. The World is being Changed rapidly by developing technology and industrial. It affect   lots of ways. One of them is   fashion area. people think that we will wear a simple, practical, light clothes. For instance, we can see that kind of clothes in sci-fi films like Starwars. however, in the other hand, there is a different idea. People like designer's clothes like Armani, Chanel..  so on. They prefer new original style in order to show them more attractive. Moreover, most designers prefer to use natural material. They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things  than chemical one. In my opinion, people want to wear special and original clothes to show their own characters. Also countless fashion will be shown. People will prefer to use more natural than chemical things and wear more beautiful and attractive clothes. I think that showing their beauty is one of animal's basic instincts. I can't stand wearing a suit or kit like  which has been showed in Starwars! ",25
809," Dear Helen Ryan, I have seen your letter for Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now. First of all, you state in the letter that the accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I like being in contact with the nature life. Secondly, from the list of activities that you are also state in the letter I would prefer swimming because when I was a child I practised this sport for 8 years. In addition, I would prefer photography too because I love taking photos. Finally, it would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of clothes I must be taken and how much I will spend during the stay at the Camp. I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't written for so long but as you can imagine I've been pretty busy with my studies. Anyway, the reason I'm writing is that you asked me about my experience with the most famous pop group in America: ""Mana"" Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help in the event. First I didn't accept but finally she conviced me. It was the most excited experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drinks. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepare orange juices. It was grateful because I knew a lot of people and the most important person was Alex, the baterist of the group. You know he is my love! He's good-looking. I enjoyed  very much. Give my love to your family Write soon Love, ",33

It is going to take place in the same hotel, the palace hotel, we suggest casual dressing for this special event. Finaly, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but I suggest you, to visit the Caldea center wich is a very special bath center. If you need futher information do not hesitate to contact us. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Jhon, In your previous letter you asked  information about interesting building to visit in my country. There are plenty of churchs, cathedrals, and olds cotages. The churchs and the cathedral are very intesting because of their differents romanics styles. I suggest you visit first the cathedral of ""Le Seu d'Mrgell"" because it is the most emblematic building in the area. If you are interested by more moderns buildings I can suggest you to visit ""Caldea"" which is a very modern bath centre with a beautiful architecture. Finaly if none of my suggestion fit with yours expectations, let me kwon more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I'll do all my best to find something more suitable.

481," Dear Sir, My name is ***. Recently I spent a week's holiday in London. read the advertisement and I found it interesting so I though that it would be nice to spent one of the nights I had in London at your musical show. But I was completely wrong. It was an awful experience. I had come with two friends on the 21st  August, and one of the reasons was that we were big fans of Danny Brook and we were looking forward to watch his show. You can imagine  disappointing  was to find out that he was replaced by another actor   not so popular. We were there at 19:15 as the show was starting at 19:30 for getting our tickets. We asked for the discounts you were refering at your advertisement but  the counter  told us that they were not available because it was Sunday. That was terrible but we didn't want to make a big deal of it so we went inside and waiting. The show started forty-five minutes later. We got really bored waiting. After the show had finished we went for dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the owner was ill. From all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening. was We are asking you to return our money. Hope you'll understand Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. From the time she was a child she couldn't keep anything for herself, she always shared her thoughts with other people She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family. She went to a new school and she had no friends. She was not very sociable and she could not create relationships very easily. By the time she became close friend with Kim, who was really strange to  other students and everybody disliked her. Pat was wondering why and one day she found out. Kim explained  her that she kept the distance from the other students because her father was in prison and  didn't want no one to find out. Pat Kept this a secret for two months but one day told it by accident to a boy from her class. In a few days all  school was familiar with Kim's story. Kim was terrified because everyone was making fun on her and   very angry with Pat. Pat had to make  up . She had to find a way to make Kim forgive her. She had found the perfect way. She stand up infront of the whole classroom and explained that Kim's father actions didn't influence Kim. That she was a great friend to her and if someone owed to be punished that was her. Kim forgave her and all the students understand how wrong they were and were very sorry. They  all got to know the real Kim know. ",37

298," Dear Sir, I am Carlos Gregore and during my last holiday I stayed in London for a week. Then, I read the advertisement for the show of your theatre and I decided to see it. Unfortunately, I noted on the advertisement, a lot of wrong points: An actor was changed and the pubblic were no informated. The show started 45 minuts late without  valid reasons! There were no discounts available like the   advertisement had written. At the end, the theatre resturant was closed for  holiday! At the bottom of the advertisement was wrote: ""YOUR PERFECT EVENING OUT"" but I think I had a very disappointing evening! So I decided to write you this letter to note that wrong informations and to ask for the restitution of the price of  ticket or a part of that. I hope you read this and write  me to   know somethings about my money Your  [SEP]  I think the modern tecnology is very important to my life. I also think I am lucky, because I live in a period of tecnologic boom. In the last fifty years the human tecnologies are growed up exponensially. First the conquist of the space, then the computers, and now the new biotecnologies have changed, and are changing, the face of the word. My daily life should be changed by these innovations! At the present day, for ecsample, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very big part of that have also  internet, the new frontier of computers evolution. If I look back in the past I can find that  computer is following the same street of television,  telephon and a lot of other things, that now the biggest part of  population have at home. So, in my opinion, new tecnology has changed, is changeing and will change my daily life, I hope that after my life is better. ",22

I had expected that I could have spend a wonderful night. But it was completely different one  which I had expected. I had been looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Can you imagine how disappointed I was when I saw the different actors on the stage? According to the advertisement the show is to start at 19:30. However it did at 20:15. We had to wait for 45 minutes! Could you understand how boring it was just sitting with nothing to do.? You mention about discounts, too. But no discounts were accepted. In addition your theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was sick! I felt so uncomfortable and the night was not perfect at all. I insist you should refund all the money that I wasted in your theatre. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Modern technology has really changed our daily life. For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is  freezing morning. We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house. The housekeeping work doesn't take much time thanks to electrical equipments. And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad. Further, we can get many information as you like at a moment with  internet. In addition, we can travel to anywhere in the world within a few days. These are  advantages which modern technology has brought to us. But I must accept that there are some disadvantages caused by the technology, as well. The biggest disadvantage is pollution. In these days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life. Air pollution by cars, Soil pollution by industrial wastes. The sea is also polluted by oil and  chemical detergent which is used at  home. Even food is polluted. All these facts mean that our modern life gives big damage to the earth. All of us must notice this fact. And we should keep our attention paid in order save our precious earth. ",31
991," June. 13. 2000 Competition Organization. Dear Sir or Madamme, I'd appriciate for giving me the first prize in the competition. It's my pleasure to give you some information and I'd like to ask you about the Camp California. First of all, I'd like to travel only in July because I'm supposed to be a volunteer in the Music festival, held in August. Additionally, I'd rather stay in tents as I've never slept in tents before. Therefore it'll be a great experience for me. I'd like to choose swimming and photography as activities. I go swimming three times a week so I have no problem with swimming. I'm also the member of  photography club at my university and really keen on taking a picture of nature. By the way, I'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much much I should bring with myself. I'll look forward to hearing answers from you. Yours faithfully, YEUN-Ja.

Now I'm going to give you some information, you asted about. I'm sory to tell that, but the only time I will be able to take this trip  in July, according to our team's shudule.

Also I enjoy walking and photography. I made two albums about birds and flowers life. So, is it posible, I would like to continue doing my favorite hobbies in the Camp. And the last question I have - Do I need to bring any special clothes or gize? And how much money should I take? Thank you, Yours sincerely Elina  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable If you need something you have a choice  to borrow it from friends or  library, or to bye it. Let's speak about shoping. As in all there are some advantages and disadvantages. Do you think it's  enjoyable  spending of time? If you would ask me, I prefer my friends to do all  shoping for me. Because I  aware of  big lines to  check point, crowds of people, noise... And of'course not all shops have good conditionering. In my opinion the better time for shoping is weekdays, preferably in the morning. Otherwise, you either will not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in  bad mood, because of  bad maners of sales people, that not every time you ask can give you any advice. It can be boring, it can be not. Summerise all, I will recomend to spend less time indoors, shopping during the weakdays. ",21
230," Dear the manager My name is Sally Smith. I went to see a musical show last Wednesday. I had a very disappointing evening. In the advertisement you said ""Danny Brook"" is the actor but it wasn't . It was somebody else. I went to see the show because I like Danny Brook. The person that played instead of Denny was not very good. The show supposted to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm. It was very late. We had to wait nearly an hour. Staff did not tell us why it started late. When I bought tickets, they did not discount at all. I asked them about discounts because I saw  in the advertisement. They ignored me. We bought tickets without  discount. I don't know that they   discount for somebody else or not. After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it  closed. It closed at 11 pm. It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm. The show finished late. The restaurant should  open until the show finish. It was not a perfect evening at all. Could I please have my money back? It was £60 for  tickets. I was very disappointed about this. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sinecerely Sally. Smith.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She is one of my friend at school. She is very nice, clever, polite and friendly. Everybody love her. If you have any problems, she can give you some suggestion. If you want her to keep it secrets, do not tell her. She is not keeping secrets. This is her bad point. She always tells someone else about it. Last week, Tim told Pat about his serious problem. He wanted Pat to keep it between them but Pat did not keep his promise. She told us about it. When Tim found out that we knew his problem and  tried to help him. He was very angry with Pat. He wasn't talk to Pat at all. Basically, Tim did not know that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. She did not know when she can speak or not speak. We  so worry about her in the future. She has not a lot of friend because of this point. ",30
577," Dear Helen Ryan, I was really glad to receive your letter and find out that I won the competition. I am writing this letter to give you all the necessary details. First of all, you have asked me when I would like to travel. Actually, I could only travel in July, when I am having my school vacations and I will be totally free. As you have asked me about the accommodation, I would be grateful if I could stay in a tent - as it seems to be more practical and comfortable. Among the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - ,and Photography - from which I know just the basical skills. I would like to know if I should take  winter-clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Natalia Lopes  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable With the increasing of violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres. Shopping may be very enjoyable, in fact, as people get in contact with new products, take a look at shops, buy some things or just walk around. But it can also be dangerous. First, most part of shoping centres uses artificial illumination and refiguration, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring. Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumism may develop to a compulsion. There are cases of people that can not spend one day without buying anything. After all that we can notice that shopping can be a good option as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time. ",35
430," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writting to you about the show. I was very disappointed after this show. I would like to have my money back. At first the show started at 10.15, and it should be at 19.30. After your show I wanted to visit my friends, and because of it, I didn't do it. Also, you wrote about discounts, but it's not true! The woman, who sold  a ticket was very roud with me, actually she started swearing at me. During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit  restaurant, it's a pity, but  restaurant was closed because it was too late. And, I forget to say  about  actor, I didn't enjoy them. So, I hope I will get my money back, it was  very disappointing evening out in my life! I hope you understand me! your sincerely Ongelina  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but any way I trusted him. It's happened 3 months ago, and during this  months I am very upset. I have a friend, his name  Peter, he is my best friend. One day Peter killed one boy. They were just playing and be acsident, Peter shoot him. I was there, I saw it. I hoped that it, just could see  3 people, but it was  mistake... Pat saw it! We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret, not to tell anyone. We trusted him. At first several days, Pat all the time was with us. He promised to keep  secret, in the next morning we had  arguiment with Pat,  3 of us were shouting at each other, in shorter Pat went away from us. Two days later in the morning, the policeman came to  Peter... So, now my best friend is  prisoner. All the time I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in the prison  5 years. By the way I don't see Pat  about one year. Perhaps, he moved into another town. It's good that he  far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny... ",9
1167," Dear Mrs Smith, I am applying  your letter where  you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is situated in the city center, at 15 minutes walking from where the conference take place in. In the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College. The conference will start at 7 p.m, the same day we expect, the 18th of June. Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks, drinks and music. For the people  interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke. Everybody should wear formal clothes, at least, a little bit formal. No jeans and tee-shirts. There is a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough. We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the river side, which is the best if it is a nice day, sunny an warm, for take a walk. For any details look in the next page map. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Alice knew that is was going to be a very special day for her. She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special. So, she took the bus, like every morning, and she went to school. But that day was a little bit different: she had her maths exam. She had never passed an maths exam and she was really nervous. Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea. She sat down and what a surprise she found a lottery ticket. Nobody was around her, so she took the ticket. Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place. She did the exam really well, she was very surprised, and after the exam she went home. She spend the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock. At the time, she turned on the TV and while the lottery's man was shouting  the winning numbers, she checked hers and what was the surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same!! She win £500!!! ",28
1190," Dear Mrs Smith I have received your letter, which was about that you would like me to inform you. As you know, a hotel whose name is  Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi. I am afraid there are no buses to get there. We will have a great party at the end of the conference. The party will be formal, therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress. As you know, it is not suitable to wear a jean or something . On your last day you have an afternoon free. In my area there is a fantastic park, which is the most famous park in the country. You can find a lot of things to do or to see. You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park. I hope you will find all the details, which you would like to have in the letter. If you need any  information, please let me know. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]   Power Of Computurs. How much can a computer affect your life? I think it effects  more than you think. When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked, but it was nearly impossible to have them. I felt  lack of them. I first bought a computer as I was in university. It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer.  That time I met the magic world of computers. Linking to the internet was so popular.  Internet was something amazing for me. Can you think you have every   information you need whenever you want ? Can you think you  contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ? I meet a lot of people on  internet and it really interest me. I learn a lot about their culture by speaking  them on  internet. I wasn't able to imagine this before. In addition  this, today companies can do nothing without a computer. Everything in this world works with computers from now on. Computers changed my life style, my opinion about the world. And they effect everyone's life directly or indirectly. ",26
272," London, 1st of June 2000 Mister Jones, I'm Omadar, a spanish male of eighteen years old who is spending in this town a week holiday. I decided to enjoy a play at the theatre  wich you're the manager to see the ""London's newest and best musical show."" My opinion? I had a very disappointing evening. First, Danny Brook doesn't play  ""Over the rainbow"" his paper was played by Danny De Vito. Also, the play started fourty five minutes late than the starting hour. I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not fourty five. Second, my wife and me payed £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts. The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were able that night. After a boring play, I decided to go  an theatre restaurant, but uncertainly it was closed. I decided to go home and prepare some sandwiches. The principal reason for I'm writting  you at the moment is that I want my money back, because I felt so disappointing with the theatre and also with the play. Your sincerelly,  [SEP]  It's a good question, because I never had asked it to myself. I think modern technology is changing so much my daily life and also is changing the life of others like me. Before modern technologies arrived, you can't comunicate as easy as today we can do. An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can discover more information than  a newspaper, and also information of all around the world, that possibly never I can access without  Internet. But,  is not only news or information. You can comunicate with people from place were you  never can imagine to have a trip because it will be too expensive. An extract could be the popular chats, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like to use the keyboard to tell something or comunicate, you can use video conference, a sistem wich  you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also  is the possibility of download things to your pc like software, pictures and also, music. The modern technologies make me  able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can wear this music to everywere. Also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we  probably still get on the ancient times. Who wants to return to the ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TV's, no phones, no PC's.. I'm afraid that the people on the ancient times lived although they don't have anything of these things, but me and everyone of this times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to this life. As well, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that  are so expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down   is because anything new is at the moment for sell. Is like a round tour. ",22
267," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000. Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I'd not go there because everythings went wrong. I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for student like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day it delaied about 45 minutes. During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove. There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them. It really disappointed me. After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed. It was a sign in front of the restaurant ""sorry we  closed because special reasons"" and I was wondering what was the reasons for that. Finally I would like to have  refund for my ticket back because it was  horrible evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Paya Chuaswee (Miss)  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets that  why our great plan for  horiday were not be real. It happened in last summer we planed to go on holiday in the Southen part of Thailand by motorbike but we couldn't tell our parents because they wouldn't allow us to go. We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place by 6 o'clock in the evening. The sun was shining and  wind were breezing like we had imaged. Whlile I was standing on the beach suddenly I heard someone called my name and said that I had to go home, that  right, she is my mum. She told me Pat had phoned her while we were going and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to went by bicycle. Eventhrough we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never though about it. From now on I don't want to tell something secrets to Pat because she always tell someone else but she  still my best friend. ",26
407," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you, because during my stay in London, I went to the theatre to see a musical show, and I had a very disappointing evening. Last Saturday I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show. I appreciated him a lot. When the show started forty-five minutes later, I realised that the main actor had been changed. That change really disappointed me. Another problem was that I didn't have any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five persons. Our idea after the show, was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed. Nobody could give me an answer. I really had an awful evening. Please send me a letter, with the explanations for all these problems that I told you . Next time, be more careful with what you put in your advertisement. I'm looking forward to receiving your letter. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good a keeping secrets. That night my parents went out, so I had to stay home with Pat. I invited my best friends, and I asked Christian to bring some videos. We left Pat in her room with those videos, and we went to the top of the house, the third floor. That room was totally dark. We went upstairs with only a candle, and the idea of planning something crazy. Manuel had a farm, no so long from the town, where we could do whatever we wanted. But what was the problem. We were too young to stay a hole weekend alone. I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had  a camping with the school. We were all agree. We were going to spend a weekend alone, with nobody else, playing football, going to bed at the time we wanted, talking about girls. It was perfect. We were very calm, discussing the last details of our weekend, when we heard a noise that came out from a room that was near us. Manuel opened the door, and there she was, Pat with Ramiro's sister hearing all our conversation. ",22
811," Dear Madam Helen Ryan, I have received your letter yesterday. I really thanks  for your organisation has given me the opportunities to go abroad U.S.A. The date that I would like to travel, that will be nice to go on  1st of July. Because my summer holidays break is start at  end of June. And I need  few days to prepare my stuff. Regarding to the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents more than log carbins because I have a lot of experiences of built up my own tents. When I was in highschool I used to be a member of the campfire. The activities that you have listed forms. Some of the them I  really interested in it, especially painting. Since I was young, my dad he alway took me out to have live drawings, so now it became  my hobbies. And I think, it is nice to draw the beautiful landscapes of the place. Beside drawings, swimming is my favourite as well. When I was in highschool, I have joined in the swimming club. And I also participated in a few swimming competition. Although I'm not the best, but I have a lot of confident in it. At last  some of things I need to clarify, that is, what type of clothes and  money do I need to prepared. Thanks again.  [SEP]  I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. For most of the people might think, why would I say that, because shopping is a very good entertainment especially for female, as me. For frank, I like to shopping. Of course not because of buying things. I like to have window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping area. It would help you  up to the date. What fashion is hit now. But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends. Then I can say I'm definatly doesn't feel any enjoyable. Because of the crowd. For me I think, it is not shopping that is kind of suffering. Especially, queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes. So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big festival, I would rather stay at home and watch television. ",17
612," Dear Helen Ryan I've just received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in your competition  2 weeks at Camp California in the USA. I am very glad to hear that and would like to tell you all the informations you need to know from me. I would be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be long enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go on other holidays because for  Easter holiday I need to attend  Tennis competition in the name of my school and we need time to practise. In  Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going to a ferry trip with my relatives. That are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other times. I do appologize about that. I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I say before that I have to attend  tennis competition so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9, now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county player  I was 12. I attended 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad influences me to play tennis and  enjoy it. For climbing, I started to be interested in it since it was 14. My family live near the sea so we have got quite a lot of chance to go climbing. I'm not scared of height and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me. I would like to ask you a few questions. How hot is it in California in July? so I know what kind of clothes I need. Do I need a lot of money, will we have time for shopping. What kind of food do we eat? This is because I cannot eat Pork. If there is any unconvenience, please feel free to tell me. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim How are you? I am sorry that I didn't write any letter to your during  last month. I really wish you were with me last month. Quess what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that happened at my school. That's why I have no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it! As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say ""yes"" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in  drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television. The preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing  concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing  stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like? It was good fun though! , but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do. At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition make me to try to work very hard and this term I get A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now I have my aim about what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder. I hope you will feel like me one day. I will write to you again soon and tell you how I  getting on. Lots of love ",25
1113," Dear Mr Robertson, I would like first, in the name of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London. We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to, is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them! ... well actually we've must received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance is free for the students so that won't raise the cost for the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were to go shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind! I hope you will take account of our request, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. George was about to be linched on account of his colour skin. Someone had to react ... I had to react! ... otherwise I would have felt responsible for his death, for the rest of my life. George was leaning on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood. He had just been beaten by a ground of white men. And yet, he was too weak to resist the rats, coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death. He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner. No one was garding him. They were all celebrating their victory with a gorgeous dinner around the fire place. I tiptoed as far as the house, carefully opened the door, and headed to George. At the very moment when he say me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope. I delivered him and we were about to flee, taking back our dignity and freedom overwhelmed with join, when we saw a whiteman, targelting his gun at us, and about to shoot ... ",39
351," Dear Sir/Madam, Last night I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"", and I have to say that I had a very disappointing evening, even though I heard that the show was exciting. Two days before I read the advertisment for this show, where  Danny Brook was starring. Unfortunately last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing. Apart from that the show started at 20:15 not at 19:30, as it is written in the advertisment and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished. I am in London for a week and I had to say that last evening I had an awful time, so I want some of my money back. I am looking forward to receive your reply with my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I had been friends for a long time and as my best friend he knew all my secrets. Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother want to talk  me for something, so I went in her bedroom to speak with her. She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went in a party without asked her and that she had to punish me for that. She told me that I had to stay at home for that weekend and not to go out with my friends. When I went in my bedroom I reliased that Pat had told my mother for the party, because noone else knew that my mother did not know that  I called him and we had a big argument.

And according to the question of wich type of accommodation I prefer, I choose a log cabin, because I think that the tent is more messy, so I would appreciate  if you give me the cabin. And my answer to the question of wich activities I would like to choose, well I choose swimming cause  is my daily excercise and surfing. Anyway I'm not very good doing surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can make it. Oh, for last I just would like to ask you how many clothes, and money I have to bring with me. And well Mrs Helen I would really apprecciatte  if you send me back a letter with all the answers of my question, anyway.

Yours trully Alvaro Ramirez  [SEP]  Dear Kim: I hope you keep in great form, like you were the last time I saw you, how is your family, I hope everyone is ok. Well here in Dublin things  still the same, but I think somebody told you that I went to the moby concert here at the point wich is the big theatre for events and concerts, I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard, well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and everithing else, and when I get into the point, do you  who was there? just imagine, it was moby, so I went to say hello to him, and he told me would you give me a hand with my decks, so I went, and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row, oh my god Kim that  the best thing that ever happened to me, well Kim I hope to recieve a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the moby concert and everything, thank you. See you soon love Alvaro XXXX ",30
541," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am delighted to answer you back to give you more informations about me since I have won such a nice price. As I have already planned my holiday for August, I will only be available in July, after my exams. It would be nice to have a tent because I have never been camping and would like to try it, at least once. The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much. My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it. I do not have any idea of what the weather is like and what kind of clothes I should take. Also, I would like to know if it is better to exchange my money in England or in the USA. I hope you will be able to answer these questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Like most of the girls I enjoy shopping but it can be either a great moment or a nightmare. What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering around and looking at everything. Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment. The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items. You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted. To conclude, I would say that to have a nice moment shopping you had better to save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient. ",35
712," Dear Mrs Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won, I have been really very impressed. Unfortunately I became your letter with two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July. In fact I will finish my university's exams only on the first  July and after the 20th  is impossible because I am going to do four weeks volontary  in India for UNICEF. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabins, because, in spite of my love for nature, I am terribly allergic to pollins. So  stay in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems. Choose two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing,  sport in which I have many years of experience, and surfing despite I really have any experience. Unfortunately I had ever been in the US so I have any idea about how much money I will probably need and about what kind of clothes I have to take with me. Thank you very much for your attencion on my regard Your sincerely  [SEP]  If you ask at twenty womans what is their favorite hobbies probably the most of them will answer ""shopping"". But why is shopping so popular and loved by so many people all over the world? Why so many people have been contaged by this ""psychologic virus""? The verb ""have"" is probably the most used and loved by the human species. We are always trying to have more things, that in spite of care after us family, us future, or other things which are probably more important than a new perfum. Always more people, everywhere, are becoming shopping-addicts. Maybe you can think I am excessive but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous. Certenly the only fact of have something can helps people to be more sure of himself. In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein model for a certain kind of people you are cool, but it is really so important? Probably when Oscar Wilde said: ""Superficiality is the suprem vice"" he was right. We still look at what people look like and not at what they really are. ",29
436," Mr Jon Stevens, Last month I have been in London for a week to visit your wonderful city and with the intention of seeing at your Thetre the famous musical show Over the rainbow but in all my life I have never had such a disappointing evening. First of all my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets. The starring changed and this was the worst surprise I could have . My greatest wish was seeing Danny Brook's performance; you know it's the best singer. But instead of him there was a unknown young actor. What a pity, I thought. I arrived there in time, 19:15 in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected. I hadn't tought for a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should had to be a luxury restaurant where I could eat. But it was closed because it was under construction. Because of the quality of the evening I spent, the only thing you can do is giving me back at least the half of the cost of  ticket. To apologise and give the impression of being a serious theatre. I'd rather I had been at home seeing on TV my  Italy! I hope that my wish is being accepted. Your Sinceraly  [SEP]  We are in the ages of the technologic development  it's out of doubt. What could be out of control of technology? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution, between  17th and 18th century there have been sudden changes in our daily way of living. Nowadays especially in the west area of the world science and technology have done great, enormous steps in directions of the progress. Not only for the great nations, but also for every  their inhabitants. Today it's absurd not knowing how a computer works, or how to use  Internet I can buy, today, a book   being comfortable at home, can communicate with other friends faster than before. I can have my homeworks done by a calculator etc. In  future I wish I could fly on my own! For me it's very important to have my mobile and computer never broken. I think I should become crazy without them, not only me but the majority of us. But sometimes I'd rather to switch them off and think of what I could waste, like love and friendship. I wish all the world would do the same. Vico says that progress gives up when Man have noticed that he have been wasting those values. ",23
684," 13th JUNE 2000 Dear Miss Helen Ryan, I am really glad for reciving the first priec in your competition, I will be very plesant joining the holliday. According to your first question, I would like to travel only at July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any class. I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as closest as possible to nature, it makes me feel better. As a regard for activities I would choose singing and surfing, surfing because it is my favourit sport, I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good on it, and singing because I really love it, I am not as good on singing as I am on surfing but I like doing it. I would like to ask about somethings which might be necessary for me to take with , like what kind of clothes should I take, should I take my own surf board, and what about money, should I bring some with me? I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  13th JUNE 2000 Dear Kin, As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand for the band called RAMONES. It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well, those guys really know how to play rock. I had only to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted. When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them, some of the girls started to take their clothes of, which was the best part for me, but some of  securities went there and took them away. Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they went back from their break they've just went of. I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've prefered to stay at the front with the others people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I holp to be able to help them next year. I holp you've enjoed my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon. See yah mate ",33
1227," Dear Maria, I would be pleased to help you about all your questions and I will provide you  some information which you need as much as I can. I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay. As you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week, we can say that   a kind of relaxation time. Nothing will be spacial. Place is  College garden. Time is 7 pm. There is no need to bother  about clouths. Everybody can put on something casual. Befor  leav from England I suggest you to visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke. You could find the opportunaty to see the country life. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Time flies I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word. I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our times passing so fast. Can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus. May be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot. Try to imagine your life without having anyof them. Wouldn't  be unbarable and painful. Ceartainly it would be just like mine. Because I live in a rural area far from any village, town, or city center. The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot. I have no car,  no local bus service to use. Even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me. And ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life. But also I'm aware of that the time flies for me. I must do whatever I want befor it is too late. And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity. ",23
296," Mr. Jones: I write this letter to informed you about the bad experience I had last week in one of the shows your are presenting. I recive a paper where I was told about a play you are presenting and of the advantages I would recive if I go to see it,  think that never happend. I am realy desappointed, and I want to have my money back. First of all, in the sheet I recived, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actor, thing that is not true, because insted of him, there was another actor, that I don't know what's his name is. Second, it says that the play would start at 19:30, and it realy started at 20:15. Third, I was told that I can have some discount, and when I was buying my ticket, the lady in the cabin told me that that discount doesn't exist. After that, when the show was finished, I was going to the theatre restaurant, and a man that works there told me that it was closed, and he don't want to give me  reasons. You can see that you promise me I'll have a good evening and I realy don't have it. So I suggest, you give me my money back, or I would go to the police, because you lie to me and you know what it means. thank you.  [SEP]  Cry Freedom - John Briley Dear Anna: I write this letter to tell you about the program that tomorrow starts, about that exelent book I have told you to read. This exelent book tells the story of a man of 25 years that have a little boy, his son, that lives in  very bad condicion. The story shows you the life that many people have to deal  every day. Shows you how they affront it and what is life, real life. The book is very easy to read, but if you don't have time I recomended to listen  the program. I have been told that they will interview a lot of people of different part that have read the book, and  tell  their experience. Also, that they would invite  psicologist, the Autor of the book and may be the president would talk so I recommend you to hear it. I hope you listen to it, because I thing that if you want to become a M.P., it will teach you a lot of thing, and you would learn more about England reality. your friend for ever. ",22
1200," Dear Mrs. Smith my name is ..., I am a local student and i will give you the requested information. The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city-centre. The hotel is just three busstops away from our college. So you and your students can take the bus from the central busstation that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference. The end-of-conference party starts just one our after the end of the conference. It is located in our sports hall. There will be live music and a midnight dinner. So you don't have to appear very noble dressed, just as you like it (there is no order - you may wear what you want). For your last day I think it would be interesting to vistit our historical and famous city-centre. I will organize a tourist guide to give us information about the old buildings and sights. If you have any more questions write me a short letter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The invention of the car was a great point in history. From there on people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted. Of course within the physical barriers. People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home-countryside. In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there. It has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city. I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go. Today I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work and to meet my friends at any place and any time. So with my car I achieved a great freedom.  ",31
792," Dear Mrs Ryan I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition. Now I can realize one of my dream. I can give you all the information that you need. I prefer to travel in July because it is the only month I can have two weeks holiday. For the accommodation I prefer to have a log cabin because I have some problems with my back and I need a bed to sleep in. I can do two activities during my stay at the camp. The first one I choose is swimming. I have a good level  in swimming and I have done some competitions last year which I have won. For the second activity I choose photography. I have take a photography course  the last two years so I am able to do some beautiful pictures. One question, I just want to know what kind of clothes do I take with me? And how many money do I need? I thank you in advance. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You want to hear about my experience in helping at a pop concert. You can't imagine how funny it was! You could do so many things because you received a free-pass which allowed you to go where you wanted and it was what I had prefer about this experience. I really enjoyed to serve the drinks to the pop-stars. You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were still in the sky. And you heard the concerts too. After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people were like pigs. But I was chatting and laughing with other workers. One more word! If you can have the chance to do it too, do it! It was a very positive experience. I didn't regret it and I want to do it again! Write  me soon. Love, ",28
664," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing this letter to tell you the informations you need and to ask you one or two questions. I would like to come in july because I work in a big company where you have to take your holiday in this month. For the accomodation at Camp California, I will prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case it has a big storm with a heavy rain it's more resistant than a tent. For the activities, I chose climbing because I took  cours during 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level , for the other one I chose photography but I am not a proffesional, I just take some pictures in my holiday! I have a little question, could you tell me if and how  money I need to take with me, and which kind of clothes? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writing this letter to tell you  my good experience at a pop concert, last month. When I came, I was a bit afraid because I did not know what I had to do, but a very nice girl told me that my first job was looking for people whose felt bad and to guide them to the nursery. I did that  two hours , this first job was sometimes a bit boring but I felt like someone who save people, so I was really happy! My second  was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a little room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridor. I was very excited when I could see a star! The next weekend I have an appointment with one  them, but I don't tell you the name because you'll fell jalous! Maybe I will tell you on the next letter! See you soon Best wishes ",25
622," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you about the two weeks in California I won in the competition. California has always been in my dreams. I will be leaving university in a few month's time but  is in my plans to continue my studied at another University trying to do a master of two years. Having decided to take a month off between University and course it would be great to have my holidays from 1st to 15th July. I have always wanted to spend my holidays in  tent but my father has never given me the permission, and this would be an ideal opportunity for me to learn about camp life. I am a good swimmer and also well at golf (handicap twelve) I took a certificate as Teachear in both of them six years ago before I went to ""CROARA GOLF"" in Milan where I organised  evening's entertainment for  customers. I hope that you can let me know, before I will live, how many degrees there will be so that I cannot make a mistake choosing my clothes and how much aproximately I will spend in money. I look forward to reading from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (0297) 8245123 in case of need. Yours sincerely, Bonfilia Conti  [SEP]  I do not agree that it is preferable to phone at the shop and give them a list of items you need instead of going to the shop and choose whatever you want. First of all, I belive that if someone has time to go to the shop has the possibility. ",25
408," lausanne, the 17th of June 2000 Dear Sir, Last weekend, I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show ""over the Rainbow"". I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in  theatre. On the paper it was writting  the principal actor is ""Danny Brook"" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor that we have never seen, and heard. I think it's really not correct. They haven't respect the timetable, the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault?! But it's not finish you wrote on the paper ""Discounts available"" but it wasn't true, it was a very badly organisation. After this bad show we had want to go to the Restaurant for  drunk and ate something and it was closed and nobody had explained  us why the Restaurant wasn't open. So, I'm very angry when I think about this evening, and I want to have my money back. I think it's the minimum you have to do for me. Thank you in advance.  [SEP]  SCHOOLS ENGLISH LANGUAGE MAGAZINE Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this sentance is very popular in our school. Pat is not an angry girl. She is very friendly but she can't keep a secret. Last year, on a Saturday evening my boyfriend phone me at 20 h o'clock and said  me, ""Would you like to go to the cinema with me"" I asked my parents but the said  me ""No you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school. Then I phone to Pat for explain my big problem. Pat said to me ""You said to your parents that you  sleep by me and you don't go to the cinema. I asked my parents and they said alright you can go to Pat for sleeping. I was very happy, I phone to my boyfriend and I explained him my secret he said allright so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema"". I passed a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phone Pat's mother and Pat's mother explain all the story to my mother. If Pat haden't say the secret to her mother I would be  have no  problem. Since this Saturday evening I had never speaking with Pat. ",24
1229," 12 June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001. I hope I can give you the information you need. So the conference will be a great experience to you and your group. Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel. The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station. A free shuttel-bus gets you to the conference-center. The bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel. The end-of-conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground. There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and many more. It is a surprice! I suggest to wear leisure-clothes to the party. The last afternoon you could go on a city-tour, visite the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park. I hope I could give you some ideas. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  What would life be without the phone? Have you ever thought about a world without  phone? How was it in the 18 century with no opportunity  to communicate by phone and how would it be now? I can not imagine how our life would be. We are living in a busy world. In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients, to make appointments, to order an article e.c.; then, time is money! How has the phone affected my own life? I think, that is a good question to think about. I could not call my friends from an other city and just say ""hello"". It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment. So, what did the phone-revolution for us? It saves  time. ",29
166," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because of the latest musical show you played in  Circle Theatre. I am keen on musicals and I have seen many of them in different parts of the world. Unfortunately the one I saw a week ago in the Circle Theatre was one of the worst. Here are some argeuments telling why me and many other people from the audience are so disappointed. First of all the musical should have started at 19.30 but unfortunately we had to wait forty five minutes. It is a wasting of time. Moreover the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical plays  great Danny Brook. I must admit I'd been looking forward to see him. In fact at the stage appeared  compleatly different person. Also discounts for tickets wasn't available. After the show together with my friends I went to the theatre restaurant to have a romantic supper, unfortunately it was closed without any sensible reason. At the end of my letter I would like to ask if it is possible to have some money back. I would be very pleased if you answered my request soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Besides this little thing she is actually perfect. But to make everything clear I'll start from the beggining. It was two years ago. The school finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with plenty of spare time. I didn't wanted to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim gave a proposition about going at the sea by his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going for a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. Parents were very pleased and happy we are so ambisious. Of course we didn't wanted to go there, it was just a ""cover"". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we were waiting. We promised to keep it in secret. Two days before going Pat was packing her luggage and asked her mother to help her. During  chat Pat mentioned about  sea and her mother found out that something was wrong. Pat started to cry and told about everything. As a result we were grouded for all  holidays and all because  our almost perfect Pat. ",26

I am writting to give the information you asked me  and also I would like to required some information about the prize. First of all I would let you know I could travel only on July because it is the time that I have holidays from my school. Furthermore I would like to choose for accomodation   tents instead of  cabins because I think  could be more exciting and  more contact with the enveiroment. Also I would like to response for the activities I had to choose from your list: I would prefer painting and photography because for the others sports I am not healthy  at the moment, and I consider I used to do painting and photography very good at the school. Finally I would like to ask if I need a special clothes and Do I need  money? How much? Please if you require extra information do not hesitate to contact me. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim: I am sorry, I haven't written  you soon but I  still excited for the experience I had helping Will Smith on the freeway the last month. Anyway now I am going to tell you everything about it. As you know I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents' house, but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car. It was a Jaguar with Will Smith on it, I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said ""of course"". He had a puncture wheel and he didn't know how to repeared  then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies, studies, everything. He was really kind and friendly but really what I really most enjoyed of it, was when he invited me  this night for a drink in the most luxury pub I have ever been . Could you believe my luck? All right that's about all my news, then writte soon and tell me about you. Lots of love ",11
2," Dear Jane, I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea. I would like to tell you some suggestions. The stars and artist are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls. I think you should put it in the advertisement. Are there going to be more plays and films next year? I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events, and by paying  the all events ticket they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expected to find interesting. I would like you to answer my letter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you,  [SEP]  Dear John, Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams. the rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them. I am looking forward to hearing from you, ",25
28," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about an annual international arts festival with a good impression. I have spent two days on it which was exciting. However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it. The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is  great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from six countries apart from your advertisement. I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events. The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic , which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for  audience, so a few people had to stand and watch  concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised. As well as that, I expect you plays and films are performed more. Even if the majority of my friends had a good time there I saw some people would anticipate it, because there were many people who were impressed in it. Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is a excellent price because when I am tempt to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand   other friends. That's how I am feeling about that. I expect you can be organised even better next year. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter. I could be interested in your letter. But it is quite different rather than you. Becoming more strict gradually at home that at school is true as you said. Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test. But most teachers consult with their parents, so it they behave wrongly it is true  teachers call their parents. Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on  weekend they have to help parents to do some chores. But people would like to change  life style in their house because there haven't been convenient appliaces in their house yet. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours ",23
574," Dear Ms. Ryan, It was  wonderful surprise when I received your letter. Thank you very much for this great opportunity. Now, I am writing this letter to reply  your questions. Firstly, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only in July, which is the only month I can take holiday from my work. Secondly, for accomodation, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try. Regarding to the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports. However, I enjoy singing. I used to join the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my favorite hobbies. I normally bring blushes, paints and paper instead of  camera when I travel. Finally, I would like to ask you wheather  anything I should bring to this travel such as specific clothes, extra money etc. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a privelage to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of ""the Rolling Stones""! I did various things for them. At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made.  Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turning the volume up and down following to the musician's instruction. My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get jelous. This was the best experience. I could give the members ""Shiatsu massage"" just before the concert to make them relax!! Can you imagine how much I appreciated that I am qualified in massage? Well, Kim, I have to go now. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",31
1173," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown isn't well and hope he'll get better soon. I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information. Your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange  a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students. As you already know we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining, then it will  a buffet and a disco. You don't need to dress up smartly but please, make sure that your students don't wear short or trainers. Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim. It's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people. There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends. I hope I've answered all your questions but if you need anymore information, please let me know. I am looking forward to seeing you all soon. Best regards,  [SEP]  To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car. Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation. Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as  fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this. From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality  life for my daughter and myself. Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before. I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it! ",38
193," To the manager of The Circle Theatre! I have been recently in London and I've seen the art ""Over The Rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me. It should start at 19.30 and it had at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed. But the worst thing in ""London's newest and best musical show"", as you called it, was the abscentness of Danny Brook. The actor wich was ""dancing"" was horrible. He had been mistakeing all the time. At the advertisement, there was written ""your perfect evening out"". Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money, I hope that in future you will corect all this mistakes. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told him my worst love story. One day, I was going to school by bus and  I don't know why  I went to the end of it. I looked up and I saw her, standing next to me with her friend. Every time when I looked up at her my legs were shaking so I couldn't come up and talk to her! But with help from my friend who convinced me to do this, I've met her. Her name was Sue and she was so beautiful that I still can't find words which could be good to describe her. I was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so I couldn't say anything! I was in Love but that wasn't nice. Few days later someone told me that Sue was actually a boy! That was supposed to be a joke from my ""coleagues""! From that moment I feel like I have been in front of a video camera and the operator of it is me! I couldn't speak to anyone. The worst thing in this story is, that Pat told this to everyone at school. From that moment I live alone. Thanks to Pat. ",23
831," 13-06-00 Dear Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I recived your letter about  I won two weeks at camp California in the U.S.A. I would like travel  July because I will have holidays in this mounth. About the accommodation at camp, I prefer in tents because I love sleep in tents,  is more interesting than sleep in log cabins. I would like do climbing and sailing while I'm at the camp, I can climbing very well I used to climbing ten years ago in my country. I'm worried about what kind of clothes I will need in the camp? and how much money I have to carry for the trip? Could you answer my questions please as soon as you can, because I'm nervous, and I need your soon answer, and I will have  talk with my parents about  camp. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays, the people are always buying anythings  maybe they don't need this things,  only buy  because  is in fashion. In the first place, when the people think only in go to the shopping  forgot others things: play with their children, talk with than parents, friends. In the other hands, when the people go to shopping  spend a lot of money. I my view,  is more enjoyable do others things than go to shopping because, maybe ""you lose your money"". ",19
980," Dear Sir/Madam. I have just recieved your letter saying that I have won the competition, I must say I was really surprise and happy to have the oportunity to join the Camp for two weeks. I would like to travel at the end of July, because at that time, I will be finishing a degree in Arts. I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while I am there, because of my studies, I will take painting as this is the subject which I am finishing at the College, allways with important cualificaitons, and photography subject which has been my hobby since I discover that I can mix in practise paint and photo. Concernet to acomodation. I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or and excurcion it won't be the same if I slept in a cabin. Finally I would like to know if I will have any extra cash for expenses, I mean food, or will I have to bring it with me? Will I have to bring my own clothes or you will give it to us? I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people seems to enjoy going shopping and spending money, it makes them happy but what about the ques you have to make to pay for something just to realise, when you get to the front, that they have to close that till and they ask you to move to the next till, what a waist of time. It happened to me once that I wanted to go on holidays, so I went to the travel agency. in the front there were some good advertisement about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them concernent to Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, but for £250. I went inside to asked for that packet but they told me that it was gone, therefore, I went to many shoops just to find the same answer. any of the adver. in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that adver.  of the   didn't do it. As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours, and don't waist your time asking for promosion advertised in the windows of the shop. ",24
1101," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for organising the trip to London. It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip to Greenwich. The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is worth visiting  exhibition and we would like to go there. The show is established on Tuesday March 14th at  Central Exhibition Hall London from 10.00 to 19.00. In the hall, there are four important themes; latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles. This is  great opportunity for the student to learn  the changing in fashion and leisure and it is free. I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme. We agreed all that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful. However, we would like to change the plans on Tuesday and Wednesday in the morning. On Tuesday morning, we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting  Science Museum and we will go there tomorrow morning. Visiting   National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning. That  all I would like to recommend you . It would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us about your decision as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the controversial one. There are people from both side of  agrument who have strong feelings. There is evidence that these people's life should be advertised by the media. Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them. In addition, their life may be the good example for other people to follow. Sometime, many people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate. However, there is other disadvantages that we should consider. Firstly, the famous people would like to do anything they want  without being concentrated by  media. I think it  is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public. Eventhough, the famous people can be the good example, they should be the bad habit for public. A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, For example, buying the clothes that famous people wear. The reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life. To Prevent many people from copying too much we shouldn't inform  all aspects of  life of famous people. I agree that the famous people life should be in private. It is the benefit for themselves and the public. ",21
589," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter informing me that I have won the competition. Below are the  question that you have asked me. Firstly I will be able to travel just in july because my class starts the month after this. Secondly, although the long cabins appeal to me, I would prefer the tents because I think it is more comfortable and atractive. Finally I would like to practise basketball and swimming, because in my school I used to train those sports a lot. Even now in a sport center, but not much. Let me know which kind of cloth I have to carry with me as well as the money that we will need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Nowadays most of the people are atractted by shopping centers, which is not always enjoyable. So, I have some opinions to this, which I would like to tell. First of all I think people have to be careful in the things that they buy because probably  are not a good quality, this is very annoyed. Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and don't spend it in the thing that they don't need because by the end of the month they won't have  money. Finally I think the product of the shops are in a good quality and reasonable price, but sometimes the staff of the shop is not very friendly with you, I think is not very nice to buy the thing there, with these people. ",24
870," Dear Ms. Ryan, Even if I worked hard on it, I was very surprised of winning just the first prize. At the moment, I'm worried of about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently achieved a new job and I started working just three months ago. For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to chose the period for my holidays. Consequently I hope that  is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work with suspends its activities. As far as I am concerned, I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tend as well. As you already know, I am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activities and painting as the second. However I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners. In this case I would rather do some climbing, which I have never done before. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  - Shopping is not always enjoyable -. In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion in which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant situation. In fact, the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need it, shopping can be a very nice activity. Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all what I can using ""on-line"" services. God bless the one who invented the Internet! ",31
1092," Dear Mr Robertson My name is Gabriel and I represented our class. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would particularly like to go to the show. As representant of my class may I kindly ask you to change partially your plan during our visit in London. The Monday 13 March would be fine. The morning  visiting interesting places in the City and on the afternoon  make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent. Because the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday, I would suggest to change your plan. There is a very interesting programme for young people like we. There will shown the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear,  several additional attractions. It will be beutiful if you would agree to change your plan. The last day, the Wednesday 15 March will surely  very interesting because the National Art Gallery is  very famous place in London. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it., It happened on a very lovly day in summer. The sun was shining, the Chanel was clear blue and I was walking by the Sea. Suddenly I heart somebody crying for the help. Not studying for too much I ran as fast as I could direct  there I heart the voice . I knew, I can't swimm then I realized it might be dangerous for me as well. But in this particular moment it wasn't important for me. The most important things was a little boy  about ten years old, who was in the watter without  parents and couldn't swimm. It was diffucult for me because I am afraid of watter. Although I went quickly to him and took him on my hands. He was exhaused and couldn't breath. In the meantime a man told me he were a doctor and could help the boy. I was very happy that I managed to save the live of the boy. Now, when I consider about the events it's clear for me that if I got  a few minutes later  probably would be to late. You should ignore the dangerous if you  convince you can save somebody his live. ",26
157," To. Mr or Mrs Manager of Circle Theatre. Hi. My name is Taeron Jon. And I would like to inform you that something is not right and  unfair about your theatre. I recently had a week's holiday in London. During I stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly I had a very disappointing evening. The advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines wee totally untrue. Which so called ""Rip off"". First of all you said Danny Brook is in the play but  different actor was in the roll. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason I mean  main reason which made me to go was to see Danny Brook. Secondly about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to  late start it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out side for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing out side and I got  horrible cold for that. lastly about the ticket  advertisment saids 'Discouts Available' but no way I had to pad  full £ 20.00 and  restaurant was closed because of rebuilding  something. How ever the point that it am trying to say is  you just ruined my hoilday. For me, It's not easy to have  holiday and your play just blew my precious time away. Let me make it clear, you blew my time and money. I don't thing your play worth £ 20.00. Your advertisment was un fair. As you are a manager, you have resposbillity  to justify this problem. and I have  right to get a fair treatment as a costomer. So therefore I would like you to pay some money back. I am not asking for full payment but minimum 50%  that it paid for nothing but the disappoint. Thank you. Yours Taeron Jon  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Fashion, what is fashion? Popular design of cloths. In  particular time? Maybe. But I say fashion is Artistic insperation which  expressed by fabric and all sort of material. In some way, fashion is combined with science as well. Now a days fashion play  big roll in our daily life. Million kinds of fashion magazines and News paper tells you how much people are interested in fashion. What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuffs. As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations that we get from all sort of enviroment. Development of science produce new materials like water proof or fire proof fabrics. For example Castum of Astronuts. These days we are very intrested in space and  millenium and things and many designers  showed millenium looks recently. But we don't wear them. Frankly we can't because we think it's too odd or strange. But what about 100 year later? I expect human being'll live in the other planets and trevel around under  sea. I think people'll wear those spacy and Ciber looking cloth after a centry. What do you think? Can you imagin you and your friends going   picnic to the Moon with  silvery skirt with Astronut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots? It could be more facinating. Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion. ",22
962," Warsaw, 13th of June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked to. First of all, the only month I will be able to visit the U.S.A. is July due to the fact that I have already arranged another trip for August. Second of all, I would prefer to live in a tent. I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason of my decision is that other activities are availiable to take also in my county, except climbing, but I have  fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me. Furthermore, I would like to ask you some questions. What type of clothes should I take and how much money would be enough? Is this a kind of ""all inclusive"" holidays? Thank you in advance. Yours faithfully, Ursula Sobczak  [SEP]  Warsaw, 13 June 2000 Dear Kim, I think I told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There was about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. Acctually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific. After the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule. We had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones. However, they were very nice people. I didn't manage to meet Michael as I had expected, but apart from that, I really enjoyed  time I spent there. You should also try . Best wishes, Ursula. ",37
1116," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to thank you for the well organised programme you have done. It will be a good opportunity for visiting London and its interesting places like the Science Museum. In addition it is properly to mention you that all the students of my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure show, which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall. The London Fashion and Leisure show is an amaizing show because there are parades with the latest fashions, we could know some famous top models Besides there are a variety of clothes either sport wear as elegant desings. Not only we could see the latest trend in make-up but hairstyles performed by important coiffeurs. With your agreement we could change the programme. Maybe we could go on shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to The Show. We would like to have  reply  to became making the arrangements. Many thanks again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I have never imagined I had to face this situation. I joined with an expedition team in order to explore the Rocky Mountains. We planned a programme. We arrived to the place in the morning and started to walk. Every thing was marvellous, I got on well with all the partners. The landscapes were the most beautiful that I had ever seen before. The weather was delightful, except  this afternoon when  started to rain and we decide to stay during the night inside a hole in the wall of the mountain. I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it, when a rain of stones covered the entrace of the hole. I was terrified, I knew that the only solution was to ask for helping. I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone, I called the police and they ask for a rescue. Thanks to God everything finished in a good way. and my partners were successfully rescued. ",24
711," To Competition Organiser Helen Ryan Thank you for choosing me in your competition for first prize. I feel very happy a I  answer immidiatly to your letter. I would like to travel only in July, because I will have  holiday  that time. I'm always having holidays in July it is my favorite time for holidays. For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents, because I use to go  tents  holidays, I like it. From  activities which you offer to me I choose swimming and tennis. I am very good in swimming. I do this sport since I was  child and I really enjoy it. I'm not so good in tennis but I would like to play it for practise. Also I find that it sport is very usefull for my health and does me feel better. It is all about me. I would like to ask you something. At first, which kind of clothes  I need take with me, because I don't know anything about the weather in California, and at tend how much money I will need. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people likes to do shopping. I hate it. I never liked shopping. It always was  trouble for me. I don't like to have many things in my house, I don't like to have many clothes and shoes, and I don't know what else. Just  nesseccary. I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they havn't  interests for  spirit (?),  intelect life. They are loosing time of their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things like sport, reading, chating about ideas which make our lives better. We must do something for help other people to feel better and  usefull. ",21
644," Dear Helen Ryan I am replying in response of the competition I won. As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the travel. First of all, I would like to travel on July, because during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives. I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in  tents, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. For the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before, which is Sailing, so I am a totally begginer at this. The other activitie is Photography, I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera, all I want is to improve my knowledge. Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many  I should pack. Is there any place that I can wash my clothes? I also needed some information on the money I will take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all? I will be waiting  a reply. Your sincerely, Sara Todi  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything. But now I found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped . There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was ""Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking  and helping the most famous pop bands!"" I was so excited that I couldn't believe . When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice with me that it seemed we had known each others in ages! They weren't those kind of people that think they're gods. I helped them  organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars! That was so great! I don't know exactly how I felt, sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream. I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible. Best wishes, Sara ",33
758," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you wanted. Firstly, you asked me about the period I'd prefer to travel: For me, the only solution is July, because I've already something planned in August. Concerning the accommodation, I'd prefer to spend my nights in a log cabin, because I've great difficulty sleeping in a tent. You also mentionned the activities I'll be able to do. I chose tennis and golf. Althoug I've been playing tennis for five years, I can't say I'm a very good player. And I'm even worse at golf, because I've never been playing it before. But I enjoy discovering  new activities! In addition to this, I would be grateful if you could send me  information on these few details: what kind of clothes is required? How is the weather at this period of the year? And should I take some money with me? How much? I hope you will be able to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Hermine Damien  [SEP]  ""Cry Freedom"" If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", from John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice? Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries. However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage,  love of justice,  fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them. To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story. ",36

Here are some of the information: I would like to travel in July because then the school year ends and I will be able to go on vacation. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I can't sleep outside in a tent. I would be very pleased if I could practice basketball and swimming I am very good at basketball and I am playing in my school's team. I know how to swim and dive from high places. I am very keen on both sports. Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you, if possible, I would like to know what kind of clothes shall I take with me. And finally how much money will I need to have with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you again Yours Sincierly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I'm writing to tell you about my experience last month. You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I've enjoyed it very much. I did many different kinds of things. First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place. Then I helped the dancers with their dance on stage. After that I helped the singers perform and dance together and finally I helped with the lights for the show. It was amazing! (the show) I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators I even met some very interesting people with who  made really good friends. What I liked the most was working with the singers, teaching them how to dance and follow some footsteps. This is an experience, I'll never forget. I'm looking forward to hearing from you very, very soon. Your friend ",29

The students at school shoudn't be shy, because they have estercotipie inside in some issues, that confuses them the means of things. 3 When you are ready to shopp, some times you know before what is your priority to buy, because probaly you need one thing  than others. But the best thing that we do, when we make shopp is spend the time having lunch at  snack bar, watching cinema and play games computer. 4 Hello Kim, Last month, I work like  roadie at  Rolling Stones Pop Concert, I was responsable of  sound that comes from the stage. Now, I have some experience  to produce CDs alive of famous band, that would like to do it. I hope so to be  producer of shows, as soon as possible. ",11
1036," Dear Mr. Robertson, We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme related to it. It is  really good programme,  especially visiting  Science Museum and  National Art Gallery would be  great opportunity to learn about art and   latest improvements in science. However, my classmates and I saw the advertisement with regarding the London fashion and leisure show, which is enclosed, and want to take this opportunity to visit it, if you allow us. It takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March. It will be  great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, new hairstyles and make up industry. Although according to your programme, we will be visiting  Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon, we would like to make a suggestion which can help us to be able to stick to both. Would it be possible to visit  Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon,  instead of it to go to the London fashion and leisure show, because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours. Thanking  in advance, we very much hope that you will give your attention to our requirement. We look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  One of the most important subject of the media is to inform people bout famous people such as politicians, films stars or successful musicians. In order to fullfill their readers' requirements they always follow them. This kind of people are known as paparazzi. it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not, they just try to find the best pose. After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them, they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission. This is the most argueing point. Do they have to ask for their permission or not. However, if they would ask, obviously they can not take the kind of pictures, which show them naked or when they are having  shower. May be they  have to pay for this kind of pictures. On the other hand, famous people have  point, if they do not allow  paparazzis to take their pictures. Because, althoug they are famous they have also their private life. Unless they do not want to share it, it must be acceptable for us. I think the best example would be Lady Diana. It was said that while they were trying escape from  paparazzis they had that accident, which caused of their lives. This can not be the way in finding information for the readers. ",37
371," Elise-Lune 48 1093 La Conversion 17th June 2000 The Manager of The Circle Theatre Dear Sir, Last week, I went to London in your theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"" and I had a disappointing evening. There problems were; Firstly, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there for your musical show, I was unhappy to constat that it was different actors this evening. Secondly, the show of 19:30 only started at 20:15; Thirdly, your advertisement said: ""Discounts available""; but it wasn't the case. Fourthly, the restaurant was closed for renovations and you don't have to propose us to go. Like you can see, I'm very disappointed for this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money. That's why I ask you to give  my money back. I ask you give me £20, back by check. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The technology is the future, and the present. For instance,  internet. All the world is now connected on it.  Internet is the ""new"" revolution of the communication and knowledge. It is now ten years that  Internet exists, but we only  used it for army and government . Now, everybody who work in  commercial companies use every day  Internet. The technology means too, every electrical machines, which don't stop to be developped. Another example, computers, every six months, something better is discovered. The modern technology has changed my daily life in every day. For instance, the meats, we don't cook our meals, everything is already done. Five minutes in the micro-waves and it's ready. The machines have replaced the work of the humains. We use every day technological machines without to know. All our life is symplifying by the machines for not waste the time to work on their developpment. ",25
637," Austria, 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I refer to your letter in which you informed me that I have won the first prise in the competition. You asked me for some further information and hear are my ""desirs"": I would like to travel only in July because in August I have to study for an exam. Further I would prefer to live in a tent at the Camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spent my holidays in tents. I would like to do painting, because one of my greatest hobbies is silk-painting and so I think I can improve my abilities. The second activity, which I choose is playing basketball, because I love this wonderful sport. We always play it at school and I am very good at it. I am in our school-basketball-team. I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you which clothes and how much money I should bring with me. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Austria, 13th June 200 Dear Kim, I hope you are fine. You know, last month I helped at a pop concert and I am sure you want to know some details. My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears. I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets. Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both ! I had to tell one of them, that she had to leave. She started crying. Such a poor girl. At this moment I didn't like my position. My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect ""dangerous"" items, I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags. This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it. Summing up I can say that it was a fantastic day, because Britney sang so beautiful and the performance was also super. I hope you can imagine how a wonderful day it was for me. Yours ",31
369," Dear Sir or Madam, I saw your advertisement yesterday. I have visited the circle theatre. I would like to say that I am not satisfied of it. First of all, there were any different actor. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad. For example, it is said the show starts at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. I have waited around one hour. Now I have a cold because it was so cold  evening. Thirdly, I would like to enquire is about the tickets. Firstly, twenty pounds are a lot of money for such a organization, on the other hand it is said that  discount is available. It is false, I have paid twenty pounds. What other I would like ask is that why it is said this is the London's newest and best musical show. I can mention it is the worst musical show. And I was invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed because there were not anything to drink or to eat. Finally it was not the perfect evening out. In conclusion, I really did not like it. I want to ask if it is possible to give me  money back. I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At the present, the technology develops rapidly. In my opinion,  World can not do without it. Firstly, I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological machines. For instance,  TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt,  discovering of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is connected to the computers. For example, education, researching of the Universe and others. Another thing I would like to say is that modern technology help us to go anywhere  rapidly. The most suitable examples are the planes. What other  I would like to mention  how important the modern technology is . We research our plant, other planets and many other things with the help of it. Finally I think that at the present the life is more comfortable . In my opinion, no one can do without modern technology. It go on to develop and always will be the most importand think in our life.

825," Dear Helen Ryan I have just received your letter, and thank you very much for your reply. I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need: First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month. Secondly, if you don't mind, I would prefer to sleep in a tent. Although it is not very comfortable, I like camping very much. Thirdly, I am very interested in swimming and also climbing. I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on . I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city. Finally, could you tell me what I need to dress and also how much money I will spend on. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I have  asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable. In fact, to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons: Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in  few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes, which you don't really need. Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them. In my opinion, doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially  I am depressed, nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet. ",24
137," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment about your theatre. On the advertisement, that I have received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour. And there were no discounts available either, unlike it was written in the same advertisement. Another disappointing point was that I wanted to watch Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him. And the actor's performance was terrible. And finally, after the show I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to eat, but it was closed because of restoration. There was no notice about it in your advertisement. Because of all these reasons, which I have listed above, my evening which should have been perfect, turned into a disaster. So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And now the situation was becoming harder to get on with. On one side it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret. But on the other side it was her best friend's family, that she must lie to. Her best friend was going out with a boy that night, And she told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat's house, in order to get permission. So Pat could not decide what to do. She did not trust the boy, and it was very hard for her to lie to people, that she liked so much. And she realized that if something happens to her best fried, it would be her fault and her best friend's parents would blame her for it. She knew she would be very sorry too. So she decided to call the parents of her best friend and tell them what was going on. Of course, her best friend would never trust her again and never share any secrets, but she was doing this for her best friends sake, wasn't she? ",34
226," Dear Madam or Sir, During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the ""Circle Theatre"". The show was called ""Over the rainbow"" and should be, in refer to the advertisment, London's newest and best musical show. But I was very disappointed. I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook to someone else I was very disappointed. Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should  begun at 19:30 but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you have mentioned some discounts in your advertisment, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student. Even your theatre restaurant was closed for repairs. The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment was the complete opposite and that is what I want to get some money back from you. I am looking forward to an early answer. Yours faithfully Herman Ruter  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I have been friends for a long time. We have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests. When we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent. I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know  that. Pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose. Two days later my father asked me whether I had thought at any time  to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard  that from some parents of my friends at school. He told me  two hours what could happen if I would do that. I was very surprised because Pat and I were along when we decided to do that. The next day Pat told me that he wanted to be admired by some girls and so he had to tell them our secret. I felt very disappointed in this moment but I have learned something new about humans;  is  you can only trust yourself. Pat and I have still been good friends but we have never had an other secret together. ",30
783," Dear Mrs Ryan: I am so happy to know that I have won first prize in your competition. As you asked me to send you further information about three points, I am sending you my preferences as follows: 1. - I would prefer  long cabins rather than  tents, because it is much more comfortable. 2. - I have chosen singing and painting as activities, because I love painting moreover, I am very good at it, and singing because  is one of my talents. 3. - I would prefer to travel only in July because at the moment I am alone at home and I have to take care of my little sister. I would like to know, what kind of clothes do I have to take with me and How much money will I need as well? Thanks in advance for you advice. yours sinicrely Bety  [SEP]  Dear Kim: I am writing to you to tell you what an impressing experience I have had, helping at a pop concert. I will start  telling you how crowded it was, the people was so excited that they were screaming from the beginning to the end. I couldn't even hear my own voice. I cleared the stage before the concert, but you don't imagine how it looked like after it?!!! full of flowers, T. shirts, hats, underwear, etc etc etc. I didn't feel my feet the next day, I was very tired.!! Anyway, I also laughed a lot, the music was fantastic, and the stars were really nice to every one. I tried to take a photo of everyone, but sometimes it was not possible. I will send you a copy of the best pictures the next time. bye-bye. Bety ",34
476," Dear manager, My name is Joseph and I am writing this letter to complain about the mass that the adimnistration of the Circle theatre presented to me. Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre. We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's favorite actor, but we seems quite disappointing, my son was very happy because he would see for the first time his favorite actor. However it's just the begining of the problems we had. Expecting the britan pontuality we went to the theatre at 19:00 to wath the 19:30 section but it only starts at 20:15, it finished later than it was suposed to and then we missed the train. I haven't seen any discounts available, I though my son would payed less than I. As we had alredy missed the first  we went at the theatre restaurant that is famous for the good food, however it was closed. In spite of this,  less you can do for us is to give  my money back and work hard so that this theater that is famouis about its beauty and pontuality don't become famous about it desorganized shows. Thanks,  [SEP]  People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes had become to. Clothes that used to be made of coton, but nowadays we can see shirts, pants socks....made of almost everything. It is a revolution in the fashion that is starting now. Nowadays we have drifit a kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our body ,  clothes that don't get wet or even dirty. Computers that make some little things for us nowadays, but at the speed at  tecnology goes in the next century those clothes will tell our doctors  our healt at any moment, any time, any where, people will be able to locate us arround the world. In the future we won't by clothes by size or even color, our clothes will adapt to our body, the weather, our fit so,  our necessities. It already started and don't have limites to go. ",26
170," London, June 17th Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to make  complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement. Then, I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one (very bad) as well. Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence. Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me. As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't appear. Those were the reasons for my asking  a refund of the £20 I paid. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Every day we find out new devices that promise us to satisfy our needs. I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful. I can't remember waking up with the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee. Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one  I consider as the most important influence technology had in my life: the computer and Internet. The improvement of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places, look for information or even keep  close contact with friends all over the world. Now, I will never say again that I don't know where can I find some information about this or that and when on holidays or every time I make a new friend, I just ask for the email  and that's enough to know we will know about each other soon.

826," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I am very happy to hear that I have won the first prize. I am writing to inform you about my requests. I also have some questions. First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' for my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times. Finally, could you please let me know what kind of clothes I should take with me? I would also like to know how much money I should take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you and travelling to the U.S.A. Yours sincerely, Chi Kimura  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I helped at a pop concert. The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'. This bank is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famous. I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience. First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The music instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in  flesh. The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work. I was so exited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band . I want to help at a pop concert again! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",36
314," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing with regards to the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' and I am going to complaining about it. I saw it last Friday and it was disappointing me because the actor was not the same man as  the advertisement ad I had expected to see him so I couldn't enjoy myself at all. Secondly, it didn't start at seven thirty. I don't know if there was some problems but I had to wait for forty-five minutes. I could not believe it! In addition to this, I could not get a cheaper ticket so I wonder why the advertisement mentioned about the reduction  tickets. Moreover, despite there were some restaurants in the theatre, they had already closed because it was too late, I wanted to have a coffee but I could not. I should not have gone to see the musical. I do not want to think you told a lie but I felt  to waste my time and money. I would like  to refund all the money and I recommend to thinking about the advertisement. I hope you understand me and the show is going to be succeeded. Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and because of her nasty habit, I lost my best friend and boyfriend at the same time. She was one of my friends and I couldn't trust her at all because she was a truble maker. One year ago, I had a boyfriend and he was a perfect man for me. I was happy at that time and I met  with him almost every day. I believed that I  get married to him although my happiness didn't last. One day, Pat gave me a ring and she told me that my best friend was going out with my boyfriend in secret. I couldn't believe her because my best friend was a boy! I was too shocked to eat anything. I tried to avoid thinking about it but I couldn't. I dared to ask him and he told me his truth. It was true! I shouldn't have asked him! And then I asked him to split up with my best friend but to make matters worse, he chose my best friend! If I didn't hear from Pat anything, I could have got married  him. I couldn't do anything and two month later, my boyfriend got married to my best friend. I felt sad and miserable. ",37
918," Dear Helen Ryan, Thanks for your letter, I am so glad that I have won first prize in your competition. And thanks again for offer me two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job. July is the only free time that I have. And I prefer tents to log cabins, as I know tents better than log cabins. I used to sleep in  tent once on my holiday, and  tent is more suitable for camping. It is very kind for you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to have climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town. For sailing, well, I haven't try it before, that is why I want to have a try. I think it must be fun. As you said, all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but I am sure I still need  some money with me. How much do you think that I will need. By the way what kinds of clothes do you think I have to get with me? And is there anything eles I have to get with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think most people will agree with ""shopping is not always enjoyable"". Because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time. Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing shopping. Yes, it is true, this is only because nowadays people have more money than even before, and some women don't earn money, they have no idea how diffcult  to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable! So it is depend on different case. For me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only go to shop unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me, I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you face  the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do. Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of  times, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifes, they are hopeless. Those are only my opinions, you don't need to agree with it, but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong.

56," Dear Jane, I am writing to you to give you some advice about the International Arts festival. I think it is a great idea to organise this sort of festival because most of people enjoy it. Firstly, concerning  stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics like jazz and rock it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about  bigger halls, it will be better. Secondly, about  plays and films it will be good if you make more because the children like it. The dance shows was very wonderful like art exhibitions. Do not change about  talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their owns books. Finally, concerned the price for the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less stress, so they can visit  more longer. It will be better, if we can make this festival at the end of summer. I hope  to give you enough information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It began when my parent sand I were going to the South of France for  holidays. We took a  car. When we were near Geneva, my father who was driving the car, had been flashed by a radar and the police stopped him. After that,  it maked a long time that he drove, so we decided to stop to an  area. We were going to the toilet and ate something to the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he forgot to close the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggages. We called the police but they said  us  if you didn't close your car we didn't make something. It was  the worse holiday in my life but we continued. When we arrived at the flat, it was eleven o'clock. The agency was closed and we hadn't  the key. We went to an hotel, it was expensive and uncomfortable. Finally,  the life in France are crasy, this is the tradition. This story happened a long time ago. ",23
989," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to provide you with the information that you require to arrange my two week holidays at Camp California in the U.S.A I would like to travel in July because, as I am working, this is the only time that I have to go on holidays. About the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have  bad back and I think that to sleep in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me. You also told me that I would have the chance of doing two activities. I would like to go climbing, because it is something that I have been doing since I was a child, so I could consider myself an expert in it. And I would like to try golf because this is a sport that I have never practised but I have always wanted to try. Finally, I would like to enquire about how much money I should take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie always enjoyable?' Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie, it is also true that  is definetly not an enjoyable one. ",37
751," Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have recieved your letters and I am going to the trip. I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price. Lastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money. It will be very kind of you, if you can answer my questions. Your sincerely, Seua Thanapol.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you. I am fine and I hope you're fine too. I have an interesting story to tell you. I've been asked to help by the well known band called Westlife. At first I was surprised but in a few secound later, when I relised that, I didn't allow to go, I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go. At last, she allowed me . I had to help them behind the state, while they were get dressed. I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly. Although the work was not heavey, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their signature and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the state and dance with them. I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience I have ever had. I was really enjoy at the concert. Thing that I particularly like in the concert is I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert which is another well known band. I really want to have that experience again. That is my story. Tell me yoors. I want to know what experience you've had when you were in England. Best wishes, ",28
1015," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising the school trip in London. I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class. Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme? The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. According to the advertisement I have seen, it is supposed to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is also free to enter for students. It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with strongest motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping at a free time on 15th March. I sincerely hope this letter will be of some help. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I believe that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for some reasons. First of all, they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrity. Therefore, they should deserve to lead a normal life as we do. Secondly, noone has the right to look at anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of privacy. To sum up, famous people are the same as we are, and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into their privacy. Therefore, I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. ",38
349," Dear Sir/Madam. I am writting to inform  some problems we had. I want to the theatre to see ""over the rainbow"" at 17th June. First of all, we went to  ticket office to get the tickets. I thought we can buy discounts tickets according to the advertisement. However, we couldn't buy them the price. eventually, we got the tickets, Because we would like to see the musical and Danny Brook. After we arrive at the theatre, We were very disappointed. Because the different actor played  the musical that day. In addition, It started  20:15. We had to wait over 40 minitues. and we couldn't enjoy dinner at  theatre restaurant after the show. I think if the musical start late time, you should open the restaurant until late time. To tell the truth, we couldn't enjoy our evening. Would it be possible for me to back  money for  tickets. I am looking forward to hearing  you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We had a secret. After we finish school, we usually gathered the place. Where do you think ? It was ship!! There was  beach  our town. One day, Freddie found it there. it was old and  little broken. But it was  most important place in the world. We always played there and it was  adventure for us. One day, Suddenly,  heavy storm came  our town. I went to the sea to see our ship. My friends had come there, too. We worried about it and we tryed to pull it. It seemed to sank into the sea, but fourtunately,  storm went  soon. Our ship left on the beach. And our parents and teachers , too. Because Pat called them. Of course we couldn't play there after that. But now, I am thinking about new secret our place. Where do you think ? It is a secret!! ",17
755," Bernard Moreau place de la Madeleine 87022 PARIS Competition Organiser Helen Ryan Dear Mrs. Ryan, You have sent me a letter about the competition  first prize I have won. You asked me about some further information. First, I'd like to travel on July at any time from the first to the 30st because of my vacation period. I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare me. Second, I'd prefer have a log cabin where I could let some stuff. Finaly, I'd like to practice tennis and to try climbing. Is there any ability required? Could you send me a note about travelling in California which could help me? Yours sincerely Bernard Moreau  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea This book stays one of the best  american litterature book. It is classified as one of the ten books that should figure in your own library. But it is also the most famous short story from Ernest Hemingway. Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it allows a deep reflexion about oldness. A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that. Then, Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man. The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful, faithful way that it callas a though about life and death. I recommand this book a lot  both to discover Hemingway and american litterature. ",22
660," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan, I'm writing about the competition you organised. I have just received a letter from you where you say I won the first prize in you competition. I'm very glad about that and I also want to ask you a few questions. I can only travel to California this July because  it will be  my winter holidays. Before and after this period is impossible for me: I have classes and I also have to work. About the accommodation, I prefer to stay in tents. I have always dreamed about going camping and staying in a tent. Now my dream will finally come true. I think this way is better to keep in touch with the nature. I would like to do photografy and swimming. I love to take photos but I don't have  techinique. I would like to learn more about it. I have always swam and I can say I'm good on it. I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need to take, if it's cold out there and about the money. How much money do you think I have to take to buy food and anything else I will need? Do you have any idea about how much we spend per day? I'm looking forward from hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Raquel Soares  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. Is a kind of relief for them. Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery, anything. Specially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking  all the news in the stores. But, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should ... So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music. Remember: go shopping is not always the better choice. It can be very unpleasant sometimes. ",33
106," Dear Mr/Mss I'm writing  you in complain about  musical show, that I have visited last evening. I had a week holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure, however it was the worse evening in my life. First of all, the actors were different from those who were advertised. Second, the show started at 20:15, althoug I read that it started at 19:30! More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant, but it was closed, it really disappointed me. It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, so it is still my dream because of your show. So, I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back. I hope you'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show, you should return my money. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern techology changed my daily life. Fifty years ago people even didn't think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented an electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that centure. And nowadays modern technology can change all our life. I mean, almost everyone has now a car, a computer, a mobil phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet. Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen. Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave. What is more Modern technology prevents different illnesses. Further more, yesterday I've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view  in 2050  year everybody will fly to the space. On the other hand people can atrophided of all this inventions. He become lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton. In conclusion I want to say that inspite of this, I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems. ",29

I WAS PART OF THE STAFF, WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS CARD AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, SPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED UNDER THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M.

1216," Dear Mrs Smith, I have received your letter dated on the 12th  june 2001. I am very happy to help you and I hope that the informations, that I am going to give you, will be enough. The international student conference will be in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne. The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place ""St-François"". And the name of the street is ""Grand-Chêne"". You can not miss it. After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead  to stay in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us. Afterwards, a live band are going to play  the rest of the night. For the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic. If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free, the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy. There, you can enjoy the Landscape and have a sunbath. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM The aim of this report is to give  further informations on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne. It is based on my own experience. WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM. The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer, for the tourist, an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake. But also, the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues. Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is the olympic history. You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects. In addition, you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games. REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION. The principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum. CONCLUSION. To sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group. Therefore, if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games, it must be the best place for this. ",31
853," Tito Torres Vargas ELIZABETH GASKELL COLLEGE Manchester, UK Helen Ryan Competition Organizer Dear Madam, Thank you for this great opportunity to travel with you for free! I entered the competition you organized but never expected to be the lucky winner. I could only travel on the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th. The accomodation that best suits me is in log cabins, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to have all my belongings in order and packed at all times. In respect of the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose in such a hugh variety, but I prefer to do those I better know  as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practise new techniques and take pictures of new landscapes. Please send me a list of the items I many need there, including the most appropriate clothes for the american weather. I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with an unlimited budget whatever they need? And finally who has all the time needed to do so? There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe. Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy  - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' age where money was not even invented. With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits  as overspending,  could lead to serious problems. At the end all depends in our attitud to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products  before going shopping. But even without money to spend  is fun to rush from time to time in the sales that seasonaly appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms. Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all! ",40
794," Dear Helen: I am very please to receive you letter, and read all the question you ask me, now, I answer the question. I would like to go travel in July, because at that moment, is stay my summer holiday, so I had more freedom time, and I want to live in tents more than log cabin, because when we live in a tent, usually we are in the countryside. at that moment, I think it should be suitable for me. Do you know, I am amuzing  to play tennis? I am  tennis first team in my school, so I can show my highly tennis skill during the holidays, and I can play Basketball as well, but not very good, you can say I only know how to play. Do you mind tell me what is the weather , when I  during the holiday, what kind the money I should bring with me and what language I should know in there? Please write back. take care From  [SEP]  What do you think about shopping? Very Fun, very happy, if go with your girl friend  will feel romatic, you should think something like this, but do you know  is not always like this. When you go to shopping with your girl friend, she want to watch every  clothes in the shopping centre, but you are not interesting of that, romatic, no! I think you will feel boring. If you interesting of the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, they should had diffence fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so at the last you both two will feel unhappy or angry to each other. If you go out with your same sex friend that should be fine, same fashion, but  everytime  go to the same place, everyone will feel boring. Shopping is enjoyable, but not very offer, so don't say to everyone  shopping is always enjoyable! ",19
477," Dear manager My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same since last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well  this musical. Then I was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start  that lasted forever and  was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I meant to go to the restaurant which occasionally was closed. By the time I thought: ""I want my money back."" That was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen. Attencionally Straussburg 17th June 2000  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Despite the fact that she was my best friend I could never count on her or she would tell everybody in high school all my secrets. Once, when we first met I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time  we found out  a very good friendship on our conversation. One day she came over to my house and we spoke all night about our lives. Then I told her about my first kiss (it was terrible, the guy didn't know how to do it) and things like that. The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience in kissing. People would be starring at me and laughing. I got really mad at her, but nowadays we are friends, not as close as we used to . I don't tell her my secrets anymore. ",23
325," 10 June 2000 Dear Manager, I would like to complain about your theatre and the musical show that I saw last week. I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about 'Over the rainbow' in the hotel which I stayed . I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited. However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time. I was really disappointed about it. Secondly,  starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes. It was so long time to wait in the theatre. Thirdly, it mentioned about discounts. Despite of the fact that I am a student, I could not get any discounts. I also visited your restaurant after the show but   already closed because the show finished late. Because of the reason above, I, indeed, spent  awful last night in London. I would like you to refund, otherwise, I will take an action. I look forward to receiving  reply to my enquiry. Sincerely  [SEP]  Fashion of the future People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years later from now. If  weather is hot then we don't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies. There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes like layer and layer. For example, T-shirts for women are included  bra: easy to take it out when you wash it,   is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it. Simplest is the best in summer! When it's very cold  winter, we just wear light clothes what we want, in our style. Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we don't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies. We can show our body line in winter as well. Most important thing is that we don't have to kill the animals only for people's cruel aims. Functions' clothes are the way to love animals! ",29
118," Dear Sir, I would like to show you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage. As I had a whole week holiday I decided to spend it in London. At first I though I would just make a bit of sight-seeking all around the city. But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical show. No sooner had I seen  the starring actor  than I couldn't believe it. Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University. But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise. If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait stil quarter past eight in order to watch the show, instead of  beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement. Although I found the tickets's prize too much expensive I though that there would be some discounts available, but there were not. As a conclution of that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed. For all of these reasons I have to ask you for having  my money back. Sincerely: a disappointed user!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. All began when I decided to take part in that school project. It consisted in having to memorisize a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam. Although this project could seem a very though work, I had to try it in order to rise my low global mark. One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet  exam on the top of his desk. Suddenly, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers on my notebook, I couldn't believe it, that would be the easiest exam I would had ever done. As I went out of the office I found walking down the corridor Pat, my best friend. As she was also making the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she hadn't to talk about that to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my class mates were in the front door of my house asking me if I had the solutions of the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret. In the exam day everybody anwered correctly to each question. And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were. It was the last time I trusted in Pat. ",30
830," Dear Helen Ryan, It would be a great plessure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm. First of all, as a reply for your letter, I'd like to say, that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full-time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time. In July I can make an exception. According to accomodation I would prefer log cabins, as they are more comfortable and I like convenience. As to the list of activities I choose climbing and surfing. I like new challenges, even when I've never done them before, and I'm really looking forward to gaining this new kind of experience. If you don't mind I would like to ask you some vital questions. Do I have to take warm clothes? How much money would you recommend me to take? I would appreciate  if you send me a reply for my Questions as soon as possible Yours faithfully Tadeusz Ochman  [SEP]  ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable"". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who with  smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous. So, as a conlusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead. ",34
331," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week. It didn't go on as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished. Firstly, it was  to start at 19:30 a I bought my ticket for the evening session. However, it began at 20:15. I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long. Second, instead of being starred by Danny Brook, the musical was starred by another actor, who I found really disappointing. Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show. I asked for the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them. In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday. I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day of main audience . Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement said and that we all wished turned out to be a regret for the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money. I'm looking forward to receiving your decision. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life has changed quite a lot with modern technology. I live more comfortably and  even more carefree than some years ago. I've been able to improve some things that could have annoyed me some time ago, and although they're mainly little changes they make me notice that my life is easier. At home, for example, my waking up is no more a surrounding sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program, set to start at seven o'clock. Then, when I was younger I would have to put the milk on the fire and wait until it was warm enough to drink. Nowadays, almost everybody have a microwaves oven, where you put your milk  less than two minuts and it is ready to delight your mouth. Another thing are the fifty-two steps which take me to the street. They have become as easy as calling the lift, without  feeling tired or even breathless, when I was in a hurry. Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out until later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of  Internet and its arriving to a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want. In brief, my life is taking the most out of the discoveries in science and technology and it can't be hidden that I'm really glad of that. ",33
112," Dear Sir, I'm writting this letter to complain about your fake advertisement. You are the theatre's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain . First of all in your show advertisement  sais that Danny Brooks starts in the play. But a different actor has started and that was very disappointing not only for me but for all  people there. The show has begun later, much more later than your advertisement writes, at about 20:15. The show started 45 minutes later. This made me get bored. You also refer to your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any. At the end you have written that there is the theatre restaurant  after the show but there wasn't. It had closed because of the late start of the show. At the end because I; hadn't have a perfect evening but a very disappointing one, I have the right to ask  my money back.   [SEP]  Modern technology changed not only my daily life but also the life of many people. Now let's talk about me. First of all I don't have to worry n the morning  if I miss the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time. Usually When I return from school the food is a lit of bit cold so I put it in the microwave to become  hotter. When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch in my country especially in summer  is too hot. So I turn on the aircondition with  timer so when I get  sleep  to turn off by itself. When I wake up if I don't have homework I sit on my computer and play different games to spend my time. At the evenings before I got to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV through the sattelite. When I go to bed because there are many mosquitoss I turn on a special machine with  pile like thing in it which kills them. I belive that modern technology has effected possitive our lives. ",23
706," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to reply  your letter in which you let me know I had won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel in July as it is the only month in this year when I do not have any exams. I am currently attending University and I have exams all term long. For accommodation I would prefer a tent, as I love nature and I like going camping a lot. About the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball. I know very little about surfing, it is almost something new for me. I have only practised it once. But, on the other side, I am a good basketball player, and I practise it three or four times a week as I play in the University team. There are some things I would like to know first of all, the kind of clothes I should take with me. Then, if I need to take any money to the camp. And finally, if you could tell  when would I be leaving and coming back. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? How are you doing at school? I have a terrible cold but I feel OK anyway. I got it two weeks ago in a concert, but although I've been to the doctor, I can't get over it yet! Well, but I don't regret going to that concert. It was wonderful! You know I love designing clothes, and there I had the chance to make a dream come true. A friend of mine was organising a pop concert, and as he knew me well, he asked me if I'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show. Of course, I accepted immediately very pleased. It was a marvellous experience, I really enjoyed working with such a nice team, they were really kind with me. And, as if it wasn't enough,  doing what I love! It's something I will never forget. And tell me, are you planning coming back to visit me? Please let me know if you have some days free so as to organise a little journey together. Well, I think I'd better close now. Write back soon! love, ",31
386," Dear Sir, A few days ago, as I was having a week's holiday in London, I read your advertisement which convinced me to go to see your show: Over The Rainbow. I must tell you that this show was the worst one I had ever been to. First of all, I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who played were not the ones who were supposed to do it! I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as it was written in your ad! Another problem: there was no discount available! Finally, at the end of this very disappointing evening, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this latter was closed because of a private party! To put it in a nutshell, contrary to what was explained in the advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back. I look forwards to hearing from you  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it. Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten year old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret for example. Thus when Sally explained  her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very embarassed. In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret. It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have prefered not to know it. Pat was totally upset. She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her. Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, when home,  locked herself in her bedroom. But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it. ",34
145," 17-6-00. Mr. Smith, I write to you because last night, (Saturday 10), I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre. I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets. Furthermore, it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience. After the play, we went to the theatre's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999's spring! How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant? In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't spend the ""perfect evening"" you announce. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Although he had promised Lise that he wouldn't say a word, when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann. Of course, Ann promised not to tell anyone, but by the lunch-break all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams. Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks. There was no escape. It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell anything to the teachers, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise. Unfortunately, the perfect plan doesn't exist, and a teacher heard two students talking in the bathroom. The teachers started investigating and asking all the students, but it was a secret and they couldn't say a word. Finally, the teachers asked Lise and her friends. No-one said a word. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",34
18," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related with what I saw in the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find. First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible of this good idea. It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city. And what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character. But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural. Secondly, there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket, due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use. Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, as ska or ethnical music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Who doesn't want to earn some money? The topic says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them. If you still don't have economical freedom from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you. One possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best, and, then, ""sell"" it to the people. For example, you can   dance folk be Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country. You must be aware, anyway, of the difficulty of this kind of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on) But maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey ,chocolate... Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso, it's enough with a bit of imagination. If you don't feel like doing any thing of this, you have alternative solutions. If you like fishing, you can try to colaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you can achieve by yourself. Finally, if anything of the above  result, you can prepare the classical parties in discos or work as a babysitter It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money. ",30
676," Dear Helen Ryan I am shocked that I won first prize in this competition. It will be a great adventure to visit Camp California. I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July. The reason is that I am a full-time student on Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of  semester, which is in June. I hope that it is not a problem. I would like you to know that I prefer a tent. I think it is much better than a log cabin. Aspecially in the summer when  tempereture and humidity are very high. From the list of all  activities I have choosen photography and golf. Since secondary school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it. I have choosen golf because I have never played in this game. Please, send me any information of what should I take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely Rafael Szymanski  [SEP]  Dear Kim Thank you for your latest letter. It was really very nice. I know that you're waiting for any information about a concert. Here it comes... My friend offered me a job as a member of  techical staff on Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew. Our job was to prepare the scene. We've built it using ready metal and wodden parts. It was really big and impressive. Then we had to plug  all electric instruments, speakers, lights and microphones. I was working with a specialist who had to connect all  lights together to one computer and prepare a colorful show. It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure of working with professionalists. It was a hard and complicated job but we all had a lot of satisfaction during the concert. Even Mr. Sting came to us to thank  for our help. I hope that you liked my story. Send me your opinion about that. I wish to see your letter soon Rafael ",31
1027," 12th December 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to thank you for organising a nice programme for us. Especially, going to the Museum and the Art Gallery would be a great oppotunity for all of us, as they are world-famous places in London. However, there is something I need to ask you. Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. In the show, we will be able to see the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. The entrance fee is free for students so the show is well worth seeing. To go to the show, we need to alter the programme. The show is on 14th and takes a whole day. So, if we could go to the Museum by using the free time on 15th it would be okay although we could not go shopping. I look forward to hearing from you shortly. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Story It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school. I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself. It was a horrible day, the day I had left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, noway to contact with my parents. What I decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, beause I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippy! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully,  not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house. It was a scary, but thrilling and exciting incident! ",38
927," Dear Mrs. Ryan Before answering your letter (which I have just recieved) about the prize of the competition I recently won, I'd like to tell you thank you very much for giving me the chance of gong to the USA. It is just a dream come true! I have been asked to say when I would like travel. There's only one month for that: July (as I am working all the year round and I am not available to leave my job). About the accomodation; I rekon I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable. During my two week sat Camp California, I'd like to practice climbing and surfing, whose  basics I know perfectly well. I am quite good at both because I do usually practice them. Furthermore, I love to go through such sports! In addition to this, I would like to know the ammount of money I should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that I will find there. Don't hesitate to contact me if there's any problem, and thank you very much again. Yours sincerely, Bola  [SEP]  Hi Kim! How are you? It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time... Hey, guess what: I gave a hand to a friend at a pop concert! It was great, and I got my entrance for free! It happened by chance: I was walking down the street when I bumped into Jane, my old friend, who asked me if I wanted to join her and a couple of mates to help at the concert. I agreed unwillingly, as I couldn't imagine how a pop concert looked like... but when I came in I changed my mind! None of the groups were known nowadays, but I belive they are well on their way to becoming famous bands. My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff, and stay there after the concert to clean everything. This was the best part because when everyone was gone, Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers!!! What was a fella like that doing in such a place? I couldn't belive my very eyes... Jane took a photograph of us toghether. I'll send you a copy as soon as I can. Lots of Kisses from Bola xxx ",33
29," Dear Ms J. Clark, I am writing to you to thank  for  so good organisation of  International Arts Festival, where I'd spent two exellent days recently. I would like to inform you whed the idea was great and I hope that so needful for people events would become a good tradition in our country. I think that providing such festivals could help people to be in the centre of cultural life of the world and to have enough information about the new art styles But I hope that next year visitores of  festival would be able to introduce with more art groups from all over the world. I suggest it would be very intresting to meet artists from far and exotic countries. Also, if I were you I would make your concert halls a bit larger, because of too many people would like to spend their holidays with their families on your festival next year Event this year some halls, which I had visited were overcrowded and there were some problems with ventilation during some shows Finishing my letter, I hope what my notes could help you to make next-year festival more intersting and comfortable for  public Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Want to be independent? Earn   yourself. Everybody knows that common students are not the richest persons in the world. But then you are at the university you need money more, then anybody else want. It is so because you are young and need to make your life as intrestng as it can be now. All that discos, concerts,  touristic trips have to be paid  by a different sum of those small coloured pieces of paper, called money Of course, the easiest way to have them is to ask your parents for help, but a great number of young persons want to be independent. So thy need to get a job  that is very difficult when you haven't  any special education and experience yet. Most common way to earn  is baby-sitting. Many young people earn their pocket money so, helping neighbouring parents to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion of different goods or even  as a bouncer. Naturally, it's easier to get a job then you were good in foreign languagers or computers. When you can find yourself  as a tourist guide or as a secretary. Sometimes small groups of students organized their own small business. For example, they can design furniture or clothes, make web-sites and so on. In two words, if the young man want to earn a bit of money by his own hands, the luck and success will find him ",26
923," Dear Ms. Ryan I refer to your letter regarding the prize I have won in your competition. I was really pleased to find out that I have an opportunity to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. As requested in your letter please find below some additional information about me and my plans. I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged for a part time job later this summer. I prefer to stay in a tent as I go campping every summer and am used to slipping in tents. From the list of activities, which was provided by you, I'd like to choose photography and swimming. I'm very good at swimming as I have been a member of different swimming clubs since I was 6 and I chose photograthy because I have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it. At the end I would like to ask you to let me know how much money & what kind of clothes I have to take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report Subject: Video about daily life at our school. Introduction: To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spend some time discussing it with other students,  observing and analaising an avrege day in our scholl and came up with some suggestions. Places to video: We should try to video not only class rooms but also our playground, cafe, sport hall, art club & library. Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are  very important part of our school life. Activities to video: We should show students during their formal studies as well as after lessons. I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as  anual sport turnament or wellcoming evening for new students. Conclugen: To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not to film anything longer than 1 or 2 minuts and have a nice mixture of places, faces and events. If you have any further comments or questions regarding this case please let me know. King Regards ",28
877," Dear Miss Ryan, I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much about that. Here is the information you want, I hope they are useful. First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June. And in August, I have to go back to school to do some classes work and I have got a camp to organise. So I would like to travel on July. Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation  in tents. Since I haven't been camping in tents so I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what will it be. About the activities, I chose swimming and climbing. I am in  swimming term a school and I won a prize last month. Although I'm not good at climbing, I want to experienced  myself. I would like to ask what is the weather in  USA like and what kind of clothes should I wear? And I was wondering how much money do I have to take? Also, if I can join climbing, what do I have to bring? At last thank you very much for answering my questions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was lovely to hear that you want to hear about my experience. I helped  the concert which was my favour singer's concert. I helped with the piano part in that concert. At the concert, I had to play 4 songs and I had never played in a concert before, so I felt very nervous before the concert. But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to claim down and play well in front of the audience  the concert. And also I have never played the piano with the singers before, and after that it makes me more confident and improved my skills a lot. When the concert finished my favour singer talked to me & they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed will in that concert. They taught me a lot about playing piano as well. At last thank you for sharing my experience. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes Yours sincerely, ",27
661," Dear Madam I'm very happy to have won in your competition. I'm never going in the U.S.A than I'm very exciting to travel at Camp California. I can to come only  July because I have to work the other months of Summer. As accomodation I'd prefer to sleep in  tents becaose I like beeing outside and earing the noises of the sea. My two  activities's choices are Climbing and Surfing. I used to climb and I want to try  still because climbing is good for the fit. I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations, but I have never practised that sport. I have one question to ask you. I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take it with me. He doesn't like stay alone at home. Yours faithfully Anton Chevalier  [SEP]  I purpose that we should be filmed five topics: A math lesson, an english lesson, a swimingpool lesson, the break and the staff room. - At the math lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher learn at his students. We could be filmed the class room too. - In the swimingpool we could been in the water and doing a party of water-polo and then Allan could done acrobatics stands, because he make competitions. - During the break we could show the activities of the students. for exemple students who play football or volleyball. We could asked some students about the school. - Before the end we could visit the staff room. We could known how this room is and what the Teachers do in this misterious room. In the end we could show a comment of each student of our class. Anton Chevalier ",20
1079," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for the exellent programme you organised for our class. We especially look for make the River trip to Greenwich. However we have send an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which will take place on the Tuesday 14th March from 10.00 am to 19.00 pm during our trip in London and in which the follow topics will be showed: . Latest fashion . Leisure and sports wear . Make up . Hairstyles We would like to inform you that we  all extremly interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because the entrance is free for the studends. We would like to request if we could go to this show on the 15th March instide off  the visit in the Science Museum. We could make this one on the Wednesday 15th March afternoon. Thank you in advanced for your comprehention and we look forward to hearing for you. Yours Sincerely,   [SEP]  The private life of famous people! Who have never dreamed  to be a famous singer, sportman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so big that they are known all over the World. I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be quiet because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them. They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do. In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life. Firstly, because it is a lot of ""scandale magazine readers"". Secondly,  because they have  admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a ""star life"" look like. In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting life and are unhappy!  ",27
302," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show, ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" a few days ago. I am writing this letter to tell you how I felt disappointed with it. There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show. With the advertisement, you mentioned Mr. Danny Brook and Ms. Tina Truelove were going to play but actually different people were playing, whom I have never seen before. And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it was not started until 20:15. To make it worse, neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available. According to the owener of the restaurant, it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off. As I am writing, it was not a perfect evening at all but horrible, so I would like to ask for  money back and compensate for my special 20th birthday. I am waiting for your reply as soon as possible.  Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Fashion Of the Future There have been already a variety of fashion style nowadays. Some are in formal others are in casual. Especially in big cities such as London, New York and Tokyo, you can see a lot of people in various clothes, so I do not think there will be such big differences in  outlooking of clothes even 100 years from now. However, I think, there will be some diffences in  quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made in especially swimming costumes and athletes' costumes for  Olympic. In addition, I think the earth will be warmer and warmer than now and 100 year from now will be an Area of Space. So clothes for space will be necessary and clothes for warmer climates will be necessary. In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think,  better quality in clothes will be created in every field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space. although  outlooking such as, shape and color will not be changed so much in fashion. ",29
435," Dear Sir or Madam, Unfortunatelly I have to complained about  musical show  in your's Circle Theatre last evening. When I become your's advertisment concerning the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I thought that I'll have a great evening, but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I start for the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend. The show had a 45 minutes delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts, whot kind of discounts? I haven't seen any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to paid a full-prize for his ticket. Becouse the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your's theatre restaurants was closed because of  holiday. Hereby I have to ask for  money back or another discounts for me. Waiting for you replay. With best regards  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The stay has begaun last year, when I stated my summer holiday. I had not any money for travelling but my parents were able to give me them if I only had a concret plans. I started talking with my parents that I will be travelling with my friends through West-Europe for one month. I had really a good plan but any good friends. I become quite a lot of money and I left home. During one week I was really travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on a railway-stations or under a bridges. After one mounth I came home back and explained my parents how a lot of fun had I with my friends - I don't know why I was such a lair. My parents belived my word's untill my younger brother Pat told them the true. Now my parents' don't belive my words. But I think, this was a good lesson for me and I  lair any more. ",23
695," Dear Sir/Madam, I am very glad to hear that I have won the first prize from you. I appreciate all about this. I am writing to you about my information which you need. Firstly, I am afraid that I am just available to travel only in July because it is difficult to get my own holiday from my work a the moment. I prefer staying in tents to log cabins because I have really been interested in making tents and staying  there. Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose Basket ball and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends from these kinds of sports. Both could be exciting for me. I would like to know more about clothes and money. I have got not idea about them. I would be grateful if you could send me some information of them. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully, KANG OFF WOO  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am happy to write a letter to you. What I really want to say is about my recent experience. Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just  as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I ever seen on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music which were so cool. After the concert I had got an opportunity to join them to the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to control their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them. Especially, Mike who is a member of Metal Potato told me I had got a talent  to play the electric guitar. It is impossible to explain all my experience without this word, ""Brilliant!!!"". I would like to invite you to their next concert and share my experience with you. Please let me know if you want to come as soon as possible. Best wishes, KANG OFF WOO ",32
616," Dear Mr. Ryan: I am writing in connection with the information requested, concerning the two-week trip I have won in the competition. Firstly, I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go. About accomodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in  tents as I believe  is the right type of accomodation for going camping? Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot. I actually have much resistance and balance so that will help me in both activities. Now, I would like to request some information about clothes and money. What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me? I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will helpful towards the preparation for the weeks in subject. Yours sincerely Gabriela Matos  [SEP]  Right size, right colour Men tease women as being shop-cravers and for having shopping as the nicest passtime. However that impression is not always true. Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your  doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable? ",35
1243," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college. However, due to the congestions and delay near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is by  underground,  Victoria Street station. You would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes. At the end-of-conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities. All different types of clothing could be worn however jean wears and T-shirts would be common on that day. Instead  staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre. The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium,  market square, could be found near our monument of our town, the Saltisy Bridge. I am looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Little Woods shopping mall Location The Little Woods shopping mall is an idea place for you and your group to visit. It is located very close to the town centre next to the town museum. It can be accessed by the nearby train station. Facilities For those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewellery, stationary, book shops, fashion and beauty departments and many more are availiable. For those who want something more exciting and advanturous, you are recommanded to visit the Fun Fair and amusement  on the top floor of the building. Other facilities such as cinemas, theatres,  large department stores could also be found . There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from aboard  to enter the car park. Conclusion Not only the tourist information centre would provide the information you might need, you could also visit the ICT block which allows you to access onto anything you want to know from the computers. A special trip could also be organized. ",30
36," Dear Ms Clark, I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me -  dances shows were absolutelly wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dances shows.  Dancers worn nice clothes,  the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefere them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all  plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably  ticket for all  evants because we could change our planes during the evant. I suggest to organize  next IAF in the summer. We are both students so we have our holiday from July to September. We have more free time in the summer. We're going to attend  IAF any time, as well. Thank you for an unusual event Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Monte, I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. At first - we have to be at time. Our lessons start at 8 a.m and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear the school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most of studenst wear jeans and  sweaters. We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school-bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. It is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we have good marks at school they let us to go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary. We aren't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol. We aren't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers It is also horrible. We musn't talk to them but  only listen to them. I'd like to change it. Student's life is hard but sometimes funny. Love ",30
618," Dear Ms Ryan I'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the  first prize in your competition and I'm looking forward to spend the two weeks at Camp California. Just because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July. This is the month that best suits me. The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip. I would rather sleep in a log cabin. I find it will be much more comfortable than a tent. The leisure activities sound fantastic especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I've joined a climbing group in my town  2 years  and  reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience on it but I wish I'd learn a lot. However, there are some questions that I want to ask you about. Do I need  passport to travel? What kind of clothes would be appropriate, winter or summer? Are there any food service at the camp? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily life video at school. The activities suggested are write below. The opening time recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in could be a good begining. It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning. Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and speaking either theory lessons or practice would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons. Why don't  include some sports, for example, voleyball? The team has been training very hard during  last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being at the video. The musical lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video. I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success. ",32
663," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter and would be glad to travel two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July for in June I will be in Austria with a friend and in August I have rented an appartment with my family. I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping. While I am at the Camp I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play very well tennis since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice in photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it. I would like to ask you a few questions: What kind of clothes should I bring? Will you give clothes for  activities? How much money should I bring there? Faithfully Yours, Pascal Fritz  [SEP]  Although many people enjoy shopping, shopping is not always enjoyable. You can fall on a very disagreable sellor and if you find what you wanted, you will not want to pay him or her for it. Sometimes the seller might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor. For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two sellers are talking and although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor. There is nothing more disagreable than that. Also, when you find a nice sellor and he shows you lots of objects, when you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose his or her time so you feel obliged to buy something. All this  to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not. ",27
119," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", that I went to see on the 16th of June. Firstly, the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook, but he was not, it was another actor, who I have never seen before, so, as you can imagen, I was very disappointed. Another complain is about the time that the musical show started, the advertisement said it started at 19:30, but it did not, we had to wait 45 minutes. It was terrible. Now, about the tickets, the were different prices but there were not discounts, and because of this, many people could not see the show, especially students. Finally, when the musical show finished, and I have to say, a bit late, I went to the theatre's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone. At  is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat, Maria's best friend Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him, in fact, she was so angry she  almost kill but, she couldn't because Pat was her best friend. Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did, but Pat refused to apologaising to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: help Maria to get the man that she loved. Maria was speechless, it was the first time that she didn't know what to do, so she decided to stop talking to Pat. After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school. Some  friends phoned her everyday, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved, despite that, she was not sad. One day, when Maria was seating in her bedroom, someone knock  the door, it was Manuel, he was worried for her. Maria was nervous, but for the first time, she could talk to him as she never did before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person of the world, she gave her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back, after all, everything happened because of her.

1214," Dear Mrs. Maria Smith. I got your letter this morning and I am very pleased to give you some information. As I know, he booked the Palace Hotel in  downtown . When you go to the conference, you can take a bus or a taxi. But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend to walk. Because there are a lot of beatiful trees and you can see the sea. And also it takes just fifteen minutes. I think everybody can enjoy it. By the way the end-of-conference party is a kind of fairwell party. There will be three parts. The first part, the chairman and a few guests will have a speech and the second part, the participacients will evaluate themselves, and the the last part it will provide dinner and drinks. It will be not too formal  party. So you can wear what you like. Moreover, I would like to recommend  'City tour' for three hours. Everybody an enjoy themselves. It is £12 each and there is a reduction for groups. I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact with me any time. And have a nice time in my town and send my regard to Richard. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and  convenient. Moreover we can not live without them. For example: electricity,  computer, telephon, boat, and car (wheel), etc. None of them are unimportant for us. But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them. If you look around at home, there are a lot of electric things. Electricity could be able to invent other things. It also gave us more free time, especially for women. It has abosolutly reduced women's our house working time. Evenmore we can enjoy our night with lights. If we want do something, we can do it at night  same as   day. Finally the quality of our life is changed by electricity. It could reduce our working time and make us enjoyable. It is also advancing more and more. It will give us  better future! Have you ever imagined that you would drive  electric car! ",25
10," Dear Mr. Clark, I'm a italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea because it's a possibility to see and to love the art, but, I think also there are some things thas could be changed. I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world. This choice doesn't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself. Some concert halls were too small and often people couldn't see the performances. There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films. Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people. The very about young people, the choice to offer a reasonably-priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art. I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people. Thank you and greetings.  [SEP]  I think a good way to get money it's work in a fast-food . Maybe the first impression isn't positive but from my personal experience, I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money. For six months I've worked in a McDonald's restaurant in Italy and I've got lots of money. I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food  you can work part-time, four, three, six hours every day. It depends on what you need. This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study. If you work in a fast-food  you can work in the afternoon, or during the night and so you have time for yourself. In the staff you can also find young people and getting fun with them during the work. What do you want more? If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that. ",28
1220," Dear Mrs Smith, I was very please to receive your letter. It is my pleasure to help you  organising the international student conference. Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located on the town centre. Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach, as there are about 35 internation students,  they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at  college main hall, at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June. There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided. Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on. Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wearing pub-wears to it, as it is suitable for dancing. Finally, on the last day, I suggest you could go  the market at town during the 3-hour gap. It is a nice place to buy the British style gifts to your family and friends. You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby. I would be grateful to give any help if you need. I am looking forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From: Genevieve Chiu To: Group leader of  American students Subject: Interesting building to visit in Hong Kong Visiting Po Lin Temple The purpose of this  is to give information to the American students, describing Po Lin Temple is worth-visited. 1. Brief history of Po Lin Temple: It was found in 1910. It is a traditional type of chinese temple. Because of the 2nd World War, it was re-built in 1960. A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world. 2. Location: The location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong. 3. Opening and Closing time: Po Lin Temple is opened to  public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday. 4. Transports You could take the MTR (HK underground) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there. Then you need to take the bus A110, A111 or A112 to Po Lin Temple. It is quite convenient. All the buses and  MTR have air-condition. 5. Attractive points: You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos. Of course, you may get more knowledge about Hong Kong, as the temple have been here for nearly 100 years. The well known Big Buhha you mustn't miss it, or you will be sorry. The temple also provide free Chinese traditional style meals for visitors. 6. Conclusion: To sum up, I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit, especially for Americans students. Easy to get there and free amittion. On the other hand, Hong Kong is known as a highly commerical city, but you could find something different in Po Lin Temple. ",27
288," To the manager of The Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam Last weekend I was in London on holiday. I had looked forward to go and see ""London's newest and best musical show ""-Over the Rainbow. I must say I was rather disappointed by the experience. I am a great admirer of the actor Danny Brook, who was supposed to be starring in the musical. Surprizingly there was a complete different actor starring. Very disappointing! According to your advertisement the musical was supposed to start at 19:30. For some unknown reason it did not start until 20:15. I was looking forward to take benefit from the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available. After the show I had planned to have dinner at the Theatre Restaurant. Unfortunatly the restaurant was closed. I bought a ticket to have a ""perfect evening out"" during my holiday. Indeed it was not a perfect evening out. Therefore I think the least I can ask from you is to give me the money back for the ticket. Sven Reitgard  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemingway Dear Sara I have heard that they will read ""The Old Man and the Sea"" on the radio P1 on Wednesday next week. It is a book written by Ernest Hemingway. I would really recommend you to listen to it. The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple. It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish. He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched. On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eats his catched fish pice by pice. The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons, but when he reaches port there is only  head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it. I really think you should take your time and listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week. Best regards Sven Reitgard ",34
789," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writting to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition. I would like also with the present to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip. First of all, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to give examinations for the First Certificate in English. Furthermore, in August I will be preparing for my course at the University which I am starting next September. Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accomodation in log cabins as I am not used on living in the countryside and especially  in tents. In addition, I would like to inform you that I  prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I will be at the Camp, as I am an active member of  Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills. I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need. I would like also  to specify if the food is including in the prize. Please let me know if you need more information. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As requested, I visited some classes during the lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place. The aim of this report is make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed. It's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory, because our laboratory is new, recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors, and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped. In addition, I think you have to take also plans from the school's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children, and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good. I think also that  will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background. In conclusion, I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help to this short video by all means. ",32
564," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am very happy to be the winner of the competition and I am looking forward to come to Camp California. I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have. From August, in fact, I will start with a new job and I will not be able to live Rome for a long period. As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because tents are too hot for me. I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do so. So, I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them. Please let me know how is the climate like at the Camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes. It would be also useful for me to know if there will be some extra expenses, in order to take enough money for two weeks. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vittoria Santini  [SEP]  Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops, try on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally go back home with dozens of bags in your hands. However, there are a few moments in which you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because  shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other month's. Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress  and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes. Anyway, apart from these two cases, shopping is always very amusing. ",35
1005," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, thank you very much for your letter. I am happy that I won the first prize and I am looking forward to travelling to California. You have had some questions which I would like to answer now: - Time of travelling: According to the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July. Due to this fact I hope you can arrange it for me. - Accomodation:  Log cabins would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California. You now that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as it will be then in California. I suppose I will have more fun if there is a cabin which is air conditioned. If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me , too. - Activities: During my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. On the other side I have no experience in surfing, - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation. - Additional question: Could you tell me how much extra money is usually needed for a two week camping ? I am looking forward to getting further information from you. Greetings from Germany! Yours sincerely Bruno Aachen  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about. 'Shopping' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about luxuary goods. In this contest, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look at it as a duty. But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy you will go shopping with much more consiousness and  joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look at it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour of shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internet and use e-business and online-shopping to order your pants for example. This is even an appropriate way to get around  unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home after you have ordered them by e-mail! Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop. You have been presented  some causes why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it. It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a 'smart' shopper. ",38
1066," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you first of all to thank you about the good programme that you give us about the trip in London, especially for planning to visit the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest to including this point in the programme. The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained it very interesting, because we will have the opportunity to see mews, firstly about the latest fashions, secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make up and hairstyles. In addition of this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for the students it is completely free. We were thinking that meaby we can go early to visit the Science Museum and than go to the Central Exhibition , where the event is going to have place! We really look forward to receiving your answer as soon as possible! Thank you very mutch! Your sincerely,  [SEP]  We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people. Of course I must agree with the opinion of my class - mates: famous people, such as actors, singers or politicians, deserve to have a private life, but of course it is not always like this! Almost the time they have journalists following them everywhere and all the time, looking for  great news or interesting pictures to put on the first page of the newspaper, and I don't think this is very nice, but  is the price that famous people have to pay, just becouse they are popular. Anyway, this is not always necessary a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, becouse  let people talking about him and increase his popularity. In conclusion, I can say that this is not the bigger problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse I am not famous! ",29
1063," Wawsaw, 12th December 2000 Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting program. We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich, the town we were always interested in. However, there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London. For example, in the time of our visit there is going to be ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"". It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage on. This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from. We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems. Our suggestion is to visit  Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long. We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time. The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and beside  that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else. Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy. I personally think the best  would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for authopraps. Like in the zoo. The biggest commercial gain in history I believe, but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way. On the other hand, they must have done something to become famous. It may in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it. To sum up, I believe that everyone has the right to keep  privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life. Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers, journalists and photographers, famous people will just have to get use to this living ""under a microscope"".

427," To the Manager of the theatre Dear Sir/Madam I am writing in order to tell your  some things that happened to me at the theatre, at that moment I felt astonish thinking about: ""How  an important theatre have problems like this."" But, Yes. First the starring was going to be Danny Brook, but then another man took his place, I couldn't believe it, you couldn't change Danny Brook, a very important artist, and put a begginer one . It was very disappointing. Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. Yes, 45 minutes, I want to see you in that case. What would you do? I felt like a dumb, and all the people felt like me. And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist. More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was on repairing. At end, I could see that the advertisement said ""Your perfect evening out"", it wasn't the perfect evening, now I'm looking for a layer, because I want my money back, if don't well you know the end of this story. Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to the school, a car stopped at her and a man said ""I know who is your love, it's Peter"". Maria passed all the day thinking about who told them that, there were two posibilities: one her best friend Becca or his sister Pat. But the problem began to increase because all her friends knew her secret. It was like a ""chain reaction"", until Maria didn't want to go to school any more, her mother talked to her, but there was no case, she was very angry and hurt. One day, at his house, she listened  Pat talking with a friend and Maria realised that Pat said everything, because they were talking about a secret of another friend. But there was a problem, how to said it to Pat, in a good or in a bad way, she decided for the good one. Obviously, Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologyse  Maria, after then Pat never again talked about someone within his or her permission. The End. ",21
553," Dear Mrs Ryan: Thank's for accept me in the competition. I hear that the competition there are very good, and the Camp California is very famous for his competitions. I would like to travel on July because before  it's impossible for me and in July it's my birthday and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full. Another thing is my accommodation I prefer to have log cabins because it's easyeast for me. I will choose for  activities tennis and swimming, I'm good on tennis because I play since 1990 and I loved it and  swimming because I like to swim and I've been  two competition and I won both. I would like to ask you for money and clothes because my parents are travelling and it is impossible for me to have  money because my sister doesn't want me to go because I'm only 14, but when I get there I promise to return  you all the money because I don't have  cash at this moment. Thanks for all, and I will be there the next month. Your sincerely Lola Villanueva.  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable."" For me went to shop it's not the best thing I can do. Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping  they don't realised that they are outside in the real world  poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things, you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. At the rest of you who don't understand this it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need. And sometimes I get bored when I'm shopping because now I don't really enjoy it. Bye and think on this. Your Friend Lola Villanueva J. ",21
864," Dear Ms Helen Ryan I write to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the travel that I have won in your competition. First of all, I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July. Because, I am a student and in June, I will still have school. Also, in Augost I will be studying a summer English course. In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent. Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every days comforts, in these two weeks. However, in your letter  is written some activities. I would choose Basketball and Tennis. Basketball I have been playing in a team, of my town for ten years. Also Tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice every week with my friends. Finally, I would be grateful to you, if you  told me about clothes and money. Will we need any special clothes and How much you would suggest me to carry for these two weeks? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Dear Kim How are you? I am very well I'm writing to explain my experience with the pop concert; last month. First of all, I think that I help them. Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert. I was going to markets  to schools and I was giving  information  when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or book a ticket for this concert. I know, It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed  a lot. Firstly, it was a good break from the  routine. Because I did it for  first time. Also, I felt wonderful when I saw, that the concert had  succesed and every day  was croweded. Because I believed that this was a result which came  with my help. I would like to do again it in the future. It was a fantastic experience. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes ",28
91," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writting to you to complain about a theatre play I have seen, called: ""Over the rainbow"". This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons: First of all, I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons  to book a sit. Also, I'm unhappy about the bad informations of your advertisement, which clearly says, the play begins at 19.30 instead of 20.15 as my evening' show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the others spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons  and nobody went to us to apologise or advice us for an other restaurant opened late in the night. That's why, in return of all those problems, I'm asking you to give back some money. I'm looking forward to have an answer from you. Yours faithfully. BOUCHER Jean-Pierre.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry against him and let him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show to his friend that they can believe in him thrutly. For those next  days, Pat will do his best to be the most sympathic as possible. To beginning, every morning Pat says a pleasant ""hello"" in adding to that a big smail. His mother always says: ""If you are smailing and are nice with the people, the poeple would be nice and would smail to you"". As Pat does always what his mother says his friends began to play again with him, but not just his old friends, every body wanted to play with me. The morality of the story is here very clear: be nice with the people and the people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend. ",22
1097,"  Mr Robertson; I am glad about  three days trip to London. I have seen your organasation for the trip. That is really intresting. Me and my class friends have seen ad advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really want to see that. This is the reason that I'm writing to you. The show is in 14th March on tuesday. It means on  second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning  untill 19.00. My friends told me that if we wake up early on tuesday we can go to  Science Museum  about 8.00 in the morning. Your afternoon plan is  shopping but we can do our shopping on Wednesday afternoon because we will have got  free time on Wednesday. I'd like to tell you something about the show. It is in  Central Exhibition Hall and it is free to students. It is  great opportunity for us because when we go there we will be aware of about  latest fashions news, we will see leisure and sports wear, all new make up designers (especially for girls) and different hairstyles. We are also enthusiastic about your sightseing in bus and  River trip to Greenwich on Monday and visiting to  National Art Gallery on Wednesday. I hope you will consider our suggestion about your trip. Your student  [SEP]  Futuristic Designs Of People's Homes Technology has been improved by human being rapidly. This technologic improvement is changing people's lifes, behaviours even their homes. Can you imagine? What people's homes will it be like in fifty years time? I guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier. Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no. Of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but otherwise we will get lazy, we will lose our abilities that we have now. Now IT (information technology) is in our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order from to  computer and someone will bring . It means we'll lose our social lifes. But we can't stop to  technologic improvement. We should use it in positif ways. When people use to the technology they should know that  is not everything. They should seek to other lifes outside their homes. I guess that with technology people will spend their life much more in their homes. It doesn't seem to me alright. Our homes should just protect us  dangeres from outside. But I believe human will never forget what they used to be. Mankind has been always seeking different things. We'are learning a lot of things about life. and we are practicing these . In the future life will be more artifitual than I had been before. Probably our homes will be smaller than now. Because  human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay  big cities (like London, New York, Paris). It means there will be too many people in small areas. Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all. That areas will just use for agriculture. Beyond the near future may be our homes will be  outer space it will be a spaceship. We'll travel around to space. It is just an imagination. We live in  changeable world. Like everything our homes will change as well. ",25
1231," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter. I am sorry about Richard Brown. And I understand that you need help, so that I will help you as far as I can.

Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined. People do not have the impression on important inventions any more, because they have been getting more popular and common. However, there is something  which  is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention. This is electricity invented by Edison. From my point of view, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines, appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity, which makes people not to too much phisical labour. What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity. In my life, I use electricity in many different ways. At night, I can study because of it. and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry, cleaning rooms and ironing. It makes my life more convenient than that without it. To sum up, although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more, the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed. ",37

472," Dear Sir or Madam! I'm writing to you because of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre. There are several points I have to complain  wich made the evening  not nice at all. At first the show started much later than it was written out. Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons, the first one is that there was no information  how much time the start of the show is going to be late . The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month. After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor, who couldn't sing as half as good then Brook. On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available, when I ask at the ticket reception I couldn't get any discount for beeng  student. To make an result the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like  promised. For these reasons I want to ask you to get my money of £25 back. reasently Miss. Winkler  [SEP]  What is the prize? Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He didn't want to say what Sarah just had told him, it just came over  his mouth, when he talked to James. ""Sarah has won in a quiz show?"" James was more than just interested, he wanted to know what she had won. But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he already had told enough. After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah's secret. Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told in a secret to them. Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around a talking and wispering started. Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him did you tell anybody about our secret. Pat told her everything. Sarah looked at him for a while, than she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others, that she won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the sea of southern France and everybody of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",32
156," 17/06/00 Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw at your theatre two weeks ago; as a matter of fact our evening turned out to be very disappointing. First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook, but sadly he wasn't there, he was filled in by a different actor, who was instead rather disappointing. Furthermore the show should have started at 19.30 but instead it began at 20:15 which was really unpleasant. At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this wasn't possible, instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available! At the end of the show I was so tired that I decided to eat something at your restaurant, but surprisingly it was closed due to some unreasonable technical problems! The advertisment assured us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate  if you could refund completely our tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets: he always wanted to know everything about everybody and after, of course, he would give away all he knew, but one day he had some problems... His best friend Paul couldn't put up anymore with Pat always revealing his secrets, so  decided to play a trick on him. Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new misterious lover. Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially to the press. Pat obviously couldn't help being silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the story! On Sunday all the english press was waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all an invention, they got so angry that they wrote on every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!! ",33
357," Dear director of the Circle Theater! Last week I was in London. On Friday we, my friend and I visited your Theater to see 'Over the rainbow'. It should has been my best evening that week, unfortunatly it wasn't. The first thing that happen was that the show didn't start on time. Instead of 730 am as your advertisment said, it started  815 am. In the meantime we tried to get our money back to do something else, but that was impossible. When the show started Danny Brook was not acting, witch was a great dissapointment for us both. We are both big faan of him When the show was finished we went to the resturant to have something to eat. But then it was cloesed because of reparations. Due to all this troubel I think we should have our money back. We both have £15 tickets. And to an other time, make soure that your advertisment is correkt! Yours Mrs Anna Schulsson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was my best friend for several years as a child. But I haven't seen her since we were 10 years old. When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a 'House' where we used to play all afternones. In fact it wasn't a realy house, it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house. But we used to call it 'Our House'. It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it. Useally we were cooking flower-soup, and talking secrets. One day when I were there alone, I heard some other kids aproting, I sat down behind one of the stones so they shoulden't see me. One minute later, Pat and half our classe stod in 'the House' looking and laufing at me and my flower soup. Maby she did it to get friends. But in fact that day she had loosed my friendship. ",23
681," Dear Sir/Madam I am so pleased to know that I have won such  amazing prize in your competition. I  like to answer the questions you request from me. Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because of this is the month wich I could more likely have off at work for going on holiday. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at  log cabins rather than  tents. That is because I do not want to seem fuzy but I like to have some comodities when I am going on holiday and I think slepping over the floor without electricity it may annoy me. Finally, I  like to choose swimming as  activity in the Camp. I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing that for  long time. On the contrary, painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before, so that I have not any skill in drawing but I  like start doing that know when I have the chance. So that is my second choice. On the other hand, I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful in my holiday like: which type of clothes could be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring something else? If is so, please let me know as soon as possible. to look forward to getting your Reply Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear friend. I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert, where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer of the place. That was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona, Julio Iglesias, and people like them That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA. My job it was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre. Of course those places were reserved just for people well-knowed who wanted to help by joined the concert. So I had to ask them for their identifications and for their invitations. After that, I have to take them to their respective sit. At first, I was a bit scare, I mean I was afraid  not be good enough to have a good performance as  assistant; but finally every thing went well. I should say that it was the easiest and more interesting job that I have ever done. I really enjoyed it and also I did not miss the opportunity to ask the artist to take a photho with me. So, I hope to see you earliest to show  all my phothos. I think, it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget, and that was the think that I more liked of that experience. Looking forward to getting your reply and to seeing you soon lots of love ",26
969," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very pleased to hear that I have won first prize in your competition and  writing to you to offer additional information, as requested. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August. I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents. I have once experienced to have been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago. Once more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming  for a long time. How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf since I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have  chance to play golf at camp. Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano. In fact I have been playing the piano for  children's choir for 5 years. Additionally I would like to know which kind of clothes I should prepare. What's the weather like in California? How much money should I bring with me for  two week stay? I would be really greateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are things these days? Sorry not to write  you for a long time. I've been busy preparing  English exams. You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful chance. As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of  electric shock on his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accident so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon! I hope you can go  the next concert with me. Longing for hearing from you. Love, ",39
905," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for the letter which I have received with a great delight and excitement. I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have required. First of all, I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and I believe the weather would be best for camping in July. And if it is possible I would like to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I find tents uncomfortable to sleep in. The two activities I would like to do at the Camp are Tennis and surfing. I have been playing Tennis for many years and it is my favourite sport. However, I have never done surfing before but I have always wanted to learn how to do it and I believe this would be my best chance to do so. Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies. Also the amount of money I need to bring (is there any shops). And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like. Thank you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who does art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school. When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert. We were all given different sort of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers. It was the best day of my life and certainly for others, too. I wish you were there. It was fantastic. I will be looking forward to your reply. Love from ",40
231," DEAR ""CIRCLE THEATRE"" MANAGER, I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRIME MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS  DIFFERENT  , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15! AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE WHOLE PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I HAD INTENTION TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. EVENTUALLY, YOU PROMISED ON YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT HAD NOT BEEN SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.

I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE ACCORDING TO VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE YET NOW, OR A MORE FANTASCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV, AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCALIZED ON COMFORTABILITY MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIOUS  CATHEGORY. ",31

Please noted that I can only travel in July because of  summer holiday shut down. It would be any day but please let me know nearner the time. I would prefer the log cabins than tents. I think the log cabin is more fun & exciting. The activities that I would like to do are painting and playing a Golf. I have won a first prize for painting when I was at High School, and won a third prize of playing Golf for a Charity.

We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruits, milk and etc. At least most people will do their shopping twice a week for a fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it  always enjoyable. You have to try to park your cark first which sometime the space are fulled and after you have parked your car and went in the supermarket the product you wanted have run out so you have to changes your plan for dinner or going to another supermarket to facing a long queue. that make you whole day for shopping which was not fun at all.

384," Circle Theater To Mr. Smith, Circle Theater's manager 20th June 2000 Dear Mr Smith, By the following, I would like to inform you that I've assisted your new musical show,  which name is ""Over the rainbow"", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing  you to make a complaint on your advertisement, which I consider like a lying advertisement. Let me explain  you why I'm now so disappointed. I've spent one week holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had preparred  quiet a long time ago, this travel to the capital and spared a lot of money as well. We are both very keen on musical shows. We've already attended ""Cats"", the ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""les Miserables"", ""Grease"", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet  mentionned ""London's newest and best musical show"", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets. On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found  very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more  that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To International Post magazine Application for the shopping trip to New York Dear Sir or Madam, Please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner actually how the people are dressing to see how it's going to be developped into the future. Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday  was wearing broken-jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models,  medias, or new collection, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive that's  maybe not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex everything possible, in a way to create  own clothes. In my opinion, I think that people will wear no clothes anymore, just being natural,  nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity. I wish that my article comes in your magazine. With Best regards. ",24
440," Dear Mr. Smith My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' to the Circle theatre. Firstly I want to tell you how disappointing was that night. Everything in the advertisement for the show was wrong. The actors I saw in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I went at 19.30 and the show didn't begin until 20:15 so I had to wait a lot and I arrived late to a meeting I had after the show. There were not discounts available for the tickets and the theatre's restaurant was closed after the show because it was too late. So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent night. I hope you can understand me. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So in  very few days all the College knew that me and my friends were  who had crashed  headmaster's car. The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to close him in a little house, we had twenty kilometers far from the village until we could change his opinion. Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost his conscience. We put him in my car and we left him inside a closed room. When he woke up he started shouting and we had to make him calm. We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell this anybody because if he does we will hang the photos all arround the village. He accepted  and we left him  free. Everything began because he is a nasty person and he forced us to clean the college every day, for not paying a cleaning assistant. We need to do something like that to make him change. ",26
490," 17/6/2000 Saturday  Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to inform you about my disappointing evening  I spent at the play ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by The Circle Theatre. The problems started at the beginning. Although it was written 19.30 in the advertisement, the play began at 20.15. In addition, a different actor was starring instead of Danny Brooks and this was the most disappointing thing that evening for me and my friends. I was told  to be able to get discounts, however, I could not get any. I also went to your theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. As a result, I could not have my perfect evening out. For all the reasons I have mentioned above, I would like to get at least half of my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  17/6/2000 SECRETS' DAMAGE Unfortunately, Pam wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and this made her lose her friends, her job and everything she had. From the time she began the university, the problems began. She was telling  secrets of her friends to the others. One day, her friends got fed up with this and ended their friendship. Pam was sorry but there was nothing she could do about this. Then she began to work at a company. One day, she again told the secret formula or a production to a friend of hers. Unfortunately, this friend told this to some other people and when it was understood that Pam was guilty, she was fired. Life and harder than anytime for Pam then. She had no friends. Nobody wanted to talk to her either. One day, she moved to a farm and nobody has heard from her since then. ",28
353," Dear Sir, Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show. Firstly, I would like to tell you I had unfortunately a very bad evening. Indeed, I was very surprise to ear when I asked for a discount that it was not possible to have one. In spite of that, I finally decided to take one ticket. The other bad point was the time when the show started, it was already 20:15 when the first star entred on the scene, but your advertisement sayed 19.30! The worst was when the actors were presented to us and the starring names were completely different than I expected. Finaly, I didn't understand why you pushed people to visit your restaurant if you don't open it after the show! This is why for all of those good reasons I am asking for some money back. I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending of . I look forward to earing from you . Your faithfully.  [SEP]  Our century is a century of changes, of evolution. Since the end of the 40's which is the period where the technology started , nobody can say that nothing has changed. Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent of the technology. In fact our life style is based on the technology, now, if we want to stay at home without having contact with other people, we can do it, we just need a computer and a modem and that's it. If I want to discuss  with friends or order a Pizza, I can do it  easely as I want, when it want. In spite of that, I think the technology is improving my quality of life. A good example is the celular phone, I can contact my family without  problem, I can inform my company if I had an accident with my car. If I compare my life now with the life of my grand parents, I think both are comparable, I say that because without knowing  the technology, it's difficult to imagine a best life, in fact, you leave with your time. Even if the technology is important for my quality of life, I am not able to say if it will continue to be the case in 10 years. ",27
857," Dear Ms Ryan, I am the person who won your competition and I am writing in reply to your letter. First of all, I can travel only in july because that is the only time when I am free from my examinations. I prefer staying in a tent as I am used to it and find it more comfortable. The two activities I would like to do in the camp are swimming and photography. I am a good swimmer and I had some expirience in photography however I have very much to learn. Finally, I have got two questions to ask you. How much money and  clothes should I take with me? I am very grateful for your prize and looking forward to visiting the camp. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that bits from the whole school day should be filmed. This will show how the school lives. In the morning prefects make sure that everybody is awake and already up. At the assembly students are told about changes in the timetable and activities for the whole day. In the computing department student learn about informational technologies. The main job of the head of the computing department is not to teach but to keep the computers working properly. Maths is the most popular subject in the school. Mathematics teachers do  great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons. In the chemistry lab experiments are often set up. The teacher looks after the pupil while they are investigating the topic of the lesson. Meals are very important. Kitchen staff works hard to provide students with  variety of food. The video can be finished with a view of the school from outside. ",35
724," Dear Helen, I am writing to answer your letter, which I have recieved yesterday. First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very appreciate that all costs are paid for. I could travel only in July because my exam will be finished in the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off  my journey on 15th July. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years in which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf by the professional coaches. I'm enjoy playing both of them regularly. In addition, it would be nice if you could send me an address  which I am going to stay, so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family. Finally, thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I think this statement is true. In my opinion, shopping is not suitable for children whose age is under 18! This is quite a strong opinion , but I know it from my real-life experiences of shopping. When I was 15, I was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything I could find now unneccessary. I'm not dare to culculate how much I have spent for those things without thinking. However, it was not bad, my mom always told me that I hadn't have earned enough money so that I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way. Therefore, people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children  for shopping and buying such tempting objects. To sum up, shopping is not a wrong thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what you are spending it for! ",31
885," Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for informing me that I have won  first prize in your competition  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I will be pleased to send  more further information which you need. In addition, I would like to travel on july because my school will have finished that month so I will be able to go on holiday. And if it is possible, I would rather be accommadated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities  someone who I do not know well. Thank you for asking me to choose  the list of the activities. Either I am in the school swimming team and I am intered in photography professionally. Therefore I would like to improve my skills and knowledge about the subjects during my holiday. Could I please know which kind of clothes I should bring with me and  the company offers us some expensise money to spend? Once again, thank you for sending me  information. I feel, it will be the best holiday, I have ever had. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Who does not like shopping? Perhaps  just men or anybody who has  lack of time or if you are looking for something to buy particular and  shop has not range of variety. Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping. Although I am the one who loves shopping, I can not stand on the Easters, the Christmas and Sundays, because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food, buy some presents etc. However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and  the same time. it causes over crowded shops, high-pitch noise,  lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole  matters just  enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special service such as sending your order with the post or  on  telephone. It could be the solution, avoid busy hours or days, do not bring your child with you, choose the right shop which has  park. ",27
327," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow. My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook. We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor. The show should have started at half past seven but we had to wait for forty-five minutes without any kind of explanation. Not only was the show late and awful but it was expensive too. The advertisement said there were discounts available but when we arrived there the woman who sells the tickets told us the discounts were only available on Monday evenings. Despite the terrible evening we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to relax and have dinner, but we found it was closed because its floor was being repaired. As you can see it wasn't a perfect evening at all! That is why I am writing to you. I want you to give  our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true. There should be no problem as I still have the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Matt: It's been a long time since I last wrote  you! I'm always very busy traveling from one country to another, you know. I'm writing to you now because I've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christie. It will be the following Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening. It's a story titled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it. The story is about the life in a small village. The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman. That woman is supposed to have killed her husbands (at least two), because she wanted their money. The policeman lets her know he has discovered her and he won't allow another crime. He threatens to tell her husband what she had done. However, she's a very clever woman and she doesn't look worried. In the end, the three of them are having a cup of coffee and one of the cups contains a terrible poison. There will be a horrible accident in a few seconds. Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends. Drop me a line and let me know what do you make of the story. Best wishes, ",35
895," Thomas West 24 Kingsberry place CS4 1XD Tuesday 13th june to Helen Ryan Competition Organiser at Camp California Dear Madame, thank you for your letter, I've been so happy to receave such a good news that I can't already believe it. To answer your first question, I would like to travel on july if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at this time of the year. In the accomodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, he is going to be more funny, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question. I can see in the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quiet good. I finished 5th at the England Golf tour junior  in 1999, and basketball, because I would like to discover this sport I only used to play at school. I've got other questions: wich type of clothes do I have to bring? Can I change money on the campus? Are some party organized during the holidays? Is there only one teatcher for each sport, and how many are we in each group of activities? Thank you for all  informations you could give me. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report about which lessons and activities we should film. First, I think we can't shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks, because this two elements are representative of a daily life at school aren't they? First, we should film some lessons because everybody know (or remember for the growns up) that it is the activity that to be the most of a student time at school. Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily school! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free,  there are no teatchers, it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons. To come back to a strict (a little beat less) subject, I suggest that we film the sport lesson , doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups. Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchers, we mustn't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchers.

1075," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the three day trip in London. Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting. Especially,  sightseeing by bus must be enjoyable. However, my classmates and I also found another fascinating thing about the trip. It is 'The London Fashion and Leisure Show' at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on  14th of March, which shows the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all found it exciting and exhilarating. It must be a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes. In addition, students can go without paying any fees. Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March. We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping. We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon at the free time. I would be grateful, if you could understand our concern and change the programme on 14th of March. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are always followed by journalists. Do they have to give up their private lives? First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well-known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others. Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandales usually increase their fame, even if they did anything wrong. On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded , as they are the same as us, human beings. It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life. To sum up, although I think they ought to abondone their lives partly when they entre the world of fame, they should take some actions against journalists in order to protect their human rights. ",30
1134," Dear Mr. Robertson. I and all of my college have read your programme, which you organised for us, for our three days trip to London. We all think the programme is organised well, especially we're so keen on the idea  to go to the National Art Gallery, to see  work of the bigest painters on the world. I'm writing to you, because we saw a great advetisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show. The show will be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday,  14th of March between 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm. I think it's a great opportunity because, we will have a chance to se the latest fashion, leisure and sport wear, and as well the way to do the perfect make up and hairstyl. In my opinion, we can have a great time there, and entrence is free of charge for students, what is very important as well. I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go on that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to  next day. I hope you'll think about our proposition and consider to change the programme. Your faithfully  [SEP]  'My perfect holiday' 'It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it' My story began on my holiday. It was  nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine have decided to go for holiday this year to the see side. We thought  with that beutiful weather the seeside is just perfect for relax, sunbathing and joy. However the truth was a little bit diffrent. The things started happening from the first day we arrived. The weather had changed suttendly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and  rain. Despide of that we were still thinking optimisticly. We were thinking is so many other activites to relax and enjoy ourself then sunbathing on the beach. We went to  few Exhibitions, night clubs,  restaurants around  area and we really had a fun. In the end, the weather got better, so we decided to go to the beach. Everything was showing, today was going to be a good, sunny day. We went for swimming. Then again in a few minutes the weather changed and  strong storm begun. The sky went completly black, so at first it was difficult to see, where everybody is. I look around and I relised one friend of mine is still in the see, and fighting with  storm, trying to get to the side. I didn't think just went  to save my friend. Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunetly  ended good. That was the end of our holiday, and next year for sure we won't be going to the see side. ",25
1103," Dear Mr. Robertson, As you are probably aware of our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have made us a very nice schedule. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but due to the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class asked me to propose a change in our schedule. This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases on sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would be having fun, meeting the locals and practising our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school. The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show. Our free time on Wednesday could be spent in the Museum. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Sarah, I'm sorry it took me so long to write you back, but I have being very busy lately: Anyway, on your last letter you asked me whether. Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie would be or not a good present for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea! You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones  you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Specially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published. Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holidays. My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go into College. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time! I think that's all about it. Write soon. Merry Xmas and Great New Year! Love ",35
567," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am replying to your letter for the first prize of the competition, that I won and there are a number of thinks I would like to make clear. You asked me in your last letter when I would like to travel. I think the best time is the first two weeks of July, because I will be free then. I cannot travel earlier because I take an examination and I have to study for it. In addition, I would prefer to have a log cabin, because I am not used to sleeping in a tent, so it would be very difficult for me. at the beginning You state in your last letter that I will have the chance to do two activities. I would prefer basketball and swimming. When I was younger I attend I local basketball team and we became local champions, so I am good at basketball and have a lot of experience. I am also good at swimming. Last year I entered a swimming championship and won the silver medal. Finally, there is one think I would like to ask. Could you tell me what sort of clothes and how much money I should have with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you again. As you know, I helped  at a pop concert last month. and I must say it was fantastic. Let's start from the beginning. First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars. I had to iron them,  put them in order, so that the pop stars, who will sing at the concert,  look impressive. and handsome. The most exciting things happened later. I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful. I had a lot of things to do during the concert. I had to look after the tone that nothing goes wrong. That was very responsible but fortunately I had help from other person. I must say that being in a concert is very nice. But helping in a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all your need is co-operation and  don't think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Pantelis ",33
1084," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising  good programme,  especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days. I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give  the information of 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go  and to huggest our opinion. We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday 'The Times' edition of the show. It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall, London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. Firstly, it will introduce  latest fashions connecting Millenium. Secondly, we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year. It would be  fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion. Finally, we can see how to  make up and make better hairstyle in the show. Most of all, It is free for students to enter. We would like to know if it is possible to change your programme. We would be grateful if we could go there in the afternoon on 14 March because we are able to go shopping. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Whenever I recollet it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go to  Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going to  Army, I was able to apply to  Korea Auxiliary Police. One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul. Suddenly, the theft signal came into. So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly. When we arrived at the place which it happened, one man started running away. Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow. Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg. He fell down and we had to stare at each other. After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him. As a result, I could go on vacation. When I said to my mother, she asked me not to do it again. But, I was a police-man. Therefore, I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous. ",23
235," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW. I saw the show on  17th of July. Firstly, the advertisement claimed  discount ticket was available. Although I have a student card for discounts I could not get any discount. So I had to buy a normal ticket. Secondly, I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. As a result, I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00. Thirdly, your advertisement misled I could see Danny Brook in the show who I adore. When I turned up  the show, there was another actor instead of him. Fourthly, after the show the theatre restaurant was closed because of it's problems. But I could go evening out. To sum up, I believe your advertisement completely misled . So I am fully entitled to ask for  refund except for evening out. I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention. yours faithfully BO-PHAT SUN (MS)  [SEP]  Nowadays, mordern technology has increasingly been developing. We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily, on the other hands, we get also many disadvantages which could harm us. In my opinion, the main advantage is  developing of medical technology. For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting  leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body. Another advantage is sharing information. The more developing the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is. So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country. In contrast, the technology can cause a pollution. By developing of transport, we can get wherever you want to go easily, however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog. Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology. In conculsion, I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two way. One is  advantage and the other is  disadvantage. And it will change our lives, also in the future. ",23
708," Dir Madam! I'm realy enjoyed I won your competition! I'll give you  nessesserly information about me. The most suitable time for me is Jule because in August I intend to go in the countryside, where I have a small farm. In September my school starts a new study year. So, because of that I can only  then. I'd like to stay in the log cabins, because I don't like wet places like tends after rain. You ofer me a lot of activities. I play basketball and tennis very well. I went to try surfing and climbing because I've never done it. I've got also two questions. How much money  I need to stay at Camp California and what kind of clothes I should take with me? Please let me know! Regards!  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Thank you for your letter, which arrived this morning. I'm glad you're doing well. You'd like to know how was the Top-Pop Concert, which I helped to organise last month. It was absolutlly great! I was responsible about a security of one of the sectors. I gave information about correct ways to another places like tooletes and medical points. I was also asked about a timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, knifes and so on in bags. Although I worked I watched the concert. I was big fun! People danced, screamed and sung with a singer. I looked very carefully at  organisation of the event, you know I'm interestsing in it. OK. I'd better stop now because I'm going to go to a library. I look forward to hear some news from you! Take care! ",25
141," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" performed at ""The Circle Theatre"" on the 20th of May. To begin with, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but, due to a ""technical problem"", as they said, it started at 20:15. However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show on the proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the first actor was not Danny Brook as we expected but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas. What is more, there were no discounts available for the ticket fees nor we had the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons. I am not satisfied with the service we received, I am therefore writing for a full refund and I expect to receive by post a cheque for £20. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  LIKE BLIND SHEEP In the 21st century, people will all the wearing the same clothes, the same shoes, they will be buying the same accessories. We'll get out in the morning and find out that our neighbour wears our same jacket and he's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours. The thing is we are too fashion conscious, too fussy about our appearance and we'll end up forking out for smart clothes only because the people next door are doing so!! The reason why we'll do this is that we need to be accepted by the elite group that decide who you must be and how you must behave. They make you think there's noting left to do but to surrender and do what you've been told to, like blind sheep. Anyway, I don't really mind what people will be wearing in 100 years' time. As for me the only thing I care for in the morning is that I don't have my socks mismatched! ",29
467," Saturday, June 17th, 2000. Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" that has been presented in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre in the last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with that. First of all, I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced  to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and the principal point: it started forty five minutes later. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder  you could explain  me why. Due to my huge dissatisfaction, I would like my money back, as you do not make what was advertised. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, MANUELA REVES RAVERNO  [SEP]  The influence of modern technology Every day, the growth of the modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life. Today, almost no one can live without, for example, a television, a radio or electricity in their homes. The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good aspects to my life, like the facility to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image in my cab TV and in my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of comodity can led us, in the future, to a completely ""cold"" world, because of the distance between people that can be caused. Another bad points can be mentioned, like the polution for example. Despite the bad aspects that the modern technology can bring, in my opinion, if the governments tryed to do the best, and if everybody contribute with a little bit, we can solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lifes. ",26
323," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about your musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", which I recently saw at the Circle Theatre. It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several points didn't worked out as promised in your advertisement. First of all, there were no discounts available, and having payed £20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30. As a second point, the actor was not Danny Brook, as displayed, but someone else I've never had heard of before. His acting and singing was horrible. At last, after all these disadvantages, I was not able to have diner in your theatre restaurant. It was closed of some reason I still don't know. You see, it was not the ""perfect evening out"", as you had promised in the advertisement. Therefor, I would like to ask for at least half of my money back. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, Yours faithfully, Ewe P Meier  [SEP]  The pressure of secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And if he had been able to keep one, the following story wouldn't have happened. Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance. And always, every body made it surprisingly well. What was the reason? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick, when he had finished it to get his opinion. Nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it. And the girlfriend of Nick happened to be in Pat's class. She was quite clever and had known everything about this, so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared. You see, each little secret is a kind of pressure to Pat, and he only feels free if he can tell someone about it. And this is the same for everybody, isn't it? Or can you keep a secret? ",27
139," Mr Soren: Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad. I would never expected that I could be so decepted. This is not the firt time I have been in your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure ""Over the rainbow"" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of the most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or shoudn't be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourites singers, whose career I have been following since the begining, and  never appear, and nobody give any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one can do instead. Even listening some music to help us take it easy would had been better than nothing! None an announcement, not an invitation...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment  that point. That terrible place definitively needed a renewal. Well, this is not my idea of a perfect evening out, as you can realise. Each time I see the advertising I get mad. Of course, you shoud make a refund of the money , not only to me but to all the public. But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least till you continue as its manager. Expecting your news,  [SEP]  It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kind of accesories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, like always, just some weeks. All  in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again. Fashion is a part of our lives, even for those who will never reconize it. Have you notice that all the classic gentlemen wear  same tipe of suit? And what about this kind of intellectual and progressive people, don't they wear all the same model of ugly but confortable shoes? I am sure that fashion will survive for ages, even it will change to become easier to use and clean, because we all need to feel a part of our society, comunicate our way of living and thinking, be part of a group and, at the same time be different. The future will bring to us new concepts, adapted to our lives. ",24
760," Dear Madam, First, I would like to thank you for offering me this wonderful prize. For a long time I wish I came to Camp California, and now my dream is about to become true. There is no much time left in my timetable in August since I will have to work then, so I would rather come in July. Concerning the accomodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather... Since this stay at Camp California is a good occasion to discover new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner in both activities. Then, I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need there, and if I have to bring a lot of money. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Richard Amelin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably now, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert. What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons. The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: ""You know. I already know them, I have even helped them at one of their concert."" Moreover, the work I've had to do, apart from carrying material, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them. Even though my entire body aches ( material was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it a work! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Richard Amelin ",31
475," 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam: Or to whom it main concern: I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre. Well I seems to me that you should know what had happened there. First of all, I read your advertisement where it was written that the musical show started at 19.30, but do you know at what hour it started? It started at 20:15! Don't you think it is a lack of respect? Really it was. I forgot to tell you that there were no available discounts. And  tickets were too expensive! Most people couldn't afford them. As a matter of fact, when the musical show was over, I was really hungry. But as I had read your advertisement I knew there was a restaurant. So I went there in order to have something to eat. But can you believed it, it was closed. Absolutely closed. So I asked someone who seemed to be in charge, and he told me that it was too late to have a meal. This really disappoint me. I was both hungry and angry. Well I think that is all, but I will ask you to give  my money back. Looking forward  hearing from you. yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Maybe this is how my story begins. Well first of all Pat was a very  friend of mine. He was really a good friend, until something had happened. I was attending college, as I normally do. With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn from. I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loves. Yes, I think this was the only reason. His name was Cody. He was a very handsome and good looking boy. But far from that, he was a very kind person. Pat told me that he was also in love with me. He told me that it was nessary to do something about . But I didn't know what to do. Pat suggested me to talk to him. But I really didn't managed to do so. As Pat was lossing his patience, he decided to talk to him. I can say that I was very nervious or anxious about what was going to happen. He didn't kept my secret. Pat told him that I was in love with him. This was my secret and now it was not. But  so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me. But on the other hand I will never trust in Pat.

1236," Dear Mrs Smith: My name is Juniper, I am helping to organise the conference in the college. I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions. The group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held. You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference, it only takes ten minutes approximately. As for the end-of-conference party, it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9:00. All the students and staffs will join together in the hall. They can play games and talk about  personal experience. The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world. So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart. I have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you. If you are free I will show you arround our college. You can visit our newly-built science lab as well. I'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Best wishes.  [SEP]  Best choice Welcome to London. You asked me for an interesting building to visit. In my opinion, I'll recommend  British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there. The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge white round building which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library before! The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson! Apart from the national history, there are more content about the past of the world. You can go to many sections such as  Asia Hall, Egypt Hall, Europe Hall and so on. Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate. After a visit to  British Museum, you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away! Also you don't have to pay any money for it, and the transport is extremely convenient, therefore  British Museum is your best choice. Don't be hesitant any more! ",34
1212," Dear Mrs Smith, I have just read your letter and I am happy to help with giving you some further information. According to your first question, for the time of  conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel, where the reservation has been already made. It is situated near to our college, about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station, which is South Wimbledon. As you were informed, there will be a party for all attendants of the conference, which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant. Minding the fact that it will be  entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event. Finally, answering your last question about  student's day-out, I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and  Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions. If you have any further questione, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TO: Leader of the group of American students FROM: DATE: 12.06.2001. SUBJECT: Recomnendations of a place to visit INTRODUCTION: The aim of this report is to give  description and  recommendation of the most interesting building in the town.

456," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about The Circle Theatre which is very different from what it have shown. I will let you know about what I have in mind. I went to your theatre last saturday,  about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts. But a clerk said that  time for discounts had been finished. I did not care about  money and I rushed into  and then took a seat with some food. I was waiting for the show that was supposed to start at 7.30 p.m. But it started at 8.15. I felt nervous. When I saw an actor, he was a different actor. I was very upset and disappointed. After the show ended, I was on the way to the theatre restaurant. What was more, it closed because of refurishing. If you were me, how would you feel? So, I could not help to writing to you and would like to take money back. I enclosed the receipt of theatre. Yours faithfully, Bying Kak  [SEP]  - How has modern technology changed your daily life? I was born in 1973. At this time, our nation was under a developing country. Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our county very quickly. As I growed up, T.V was one of the mysteriest things like a telephone and a bus. When it comes to modern technology, I grately appreciate it. First thing is a computer. When I was a university student, I had to find out some imformation about my homework. I could not get them. but a computer made me get them from  internet. Second thing is an airplane. I have been imagining where another contries are like England. Now I am in England. I know a ship but an airplane made an arrival to here be quick. Third thing is a telephone. It saves time. Whenever I do not know about something, I phone  and ask  it. All in all, I have been having many benefits from modern technology which is very useful. But it might be a problem, making me lazy. Now, the world is one end and I have to take advantage of modern technology for my future. ",20
537," Dear Mr./Mrs: I have just received your letter in which you inform  that I won  first prize of two weeks at Camp California. I am very excited about it! I would like to travel on July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have for vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that  weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in  tents because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case. I would love to participate in the singing and photography activities. Singing is something I have enjoyed since I was a little child. In fact, I took some singing lessons. I am not very good at photography but I want to make an album to share it with my family when I come home. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes do you recommend for the camping? How much money will I need? Is it better to take cash or a credit card? Thanks for your attention. Cordially yours,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The best way to go shopping is when you think in advance  what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought. Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking. The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!! Recommendations? Wait for a sunny day, take a look into your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping ! ",33
570," Helen Ryan Competition Organiser. Dear Madame, I have received your good news and I'm very happy because I have always wished go to California and now it's real , so, thank you very much about that. First at all, I would like to give you some further information from me and secondly, I'll  ask you for some doubts that I have. About, when I would like to travel I think that my answer will be easy for you, because, I have two months off those are July and August so, my travel should be in between,  my accomodation I would like to stay in  tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru,  long time ago, it was wonderful. With regard to the activities at the Camp, I would like to choose basketball and photography, because I think that basketball is  very complete sport for training your muscles and I used to play in a league in my country, it's hard but at the same time lovely. The other selection has been done because I like to much discover different places and with a camera  is possible to do it easily. If it  possible for you to help me in some doubts I have, I'll be really greatful. One  is with regard to how much additional money you believe will be enough to enjoy the holiday? Another thing  is if the meals are include or  I have to paid for them? Once again, thanks. Waiting for your reply, best wishes. Your faitfull. Daniel Ortiz  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have heard from you recently and I'm really happy, I hope you and your family are well. I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much. Besides, she told me that you are very keen to know how was my experience, so I'll give you some information in this letter that I'm sure you will be glad , even  you have not been in the concert. First at all, I'll tell you that in the day  concert I woke up at 6:30 A.M, very early for me, you know me I'm lazzy, the work began around 8:30,  was very hard but when the band come for training, since this moment I was enjoining to work until the concert had finished, the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind with every one who was working because they understood that  a concert is a job to be done by a team. During the concert I listened  the band like everybody , besides I earned money so,  was a wonderful experience. Looking forward to hear from you. You Sincerely. ",21
828," Dear Miss Ryan, I have safely received your letter bringing the good news. I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found  that I won the competition. Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received. I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience. Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember. Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons. Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just stay in Camp California all the time? I hope that I haven't taken up too much time. Thank you for this exciting news. I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime! Yours sincerely, (Au Kwan Ming)  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience. The concert was held at our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result. Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements. I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall. I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular. It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers. I really enjoyed myself and I hope that you can have the chance to experience this too. I hope that you can write to me soon. I look forward to reading what you have to say. Bye for now! Yours faithfully, (Au Kwan Ming)  ",40
442," Mr. Manager: The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", wich really disapointed me. First of all, there were no diccounts avaible  as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich wasn't cheap at all. Then, I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started, I was really disapointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement. Finally, when the show finished, I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed for repairs. So, as you can see, it wasn't my perfect evening out at all that's why I demand you to send me my money back. Your really unsatisfied costomer  [SEP]  How has modern technology afected my daily life? Since the begining of human life, people have invented ways to make their life easier. That is not difference from now. We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day. From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night, we constantly depends on these inventions to be able to make the things we have to do. That's why modern technology is so important in our daily life, because it helps to make our life easiest and to do what we have to do faster so then we can use better our time. ",27
333," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement of The Circle theater said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there. First of all, the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I don't have the chance to enjoy his excellent performance. Another actor standed  for him, without any advice. Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show which it started forty-five minutes later without any factual reason . In addition to all this, there was no discount in the price of the tickets, for students either, contrary to what I was told by  phone when I asked for more information. Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater's restaurant. But for our surprise, it was out of order. At the end of all these circumstances we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint. So, due to the things I have mentioned, I think I shoul be given some money back. I look forward to recieving  information from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" Owing to the great speed of technological development, people need to lead a faster life. When this technological aspect changes so quickly, I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields. I would say that the worst thing of this development for me is that more and more I experience stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is no enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life passes devoted in my duties without  time to pleasures. Apart from this, another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities, being able to breath fresh air several days a month when we go to the country. In addition to this, there is less comunication between members of my family, because when we arrive at home after an exhausted day racing with the time, the only thing we want to do is lying in the sofa while watching television. Apart from this, computer's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to, while five years ago when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people. On the other hand and as a conclusion, I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions. ",31
1056," Dear Mr Robertson, You may be surprised to receive a letter from us. All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey, to visit London for three days. This trip would gives us the change to see London and to improve the english language. We all agree to the daily programme during the three days. In the morning, we will have the change, to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus, For example the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery. In the afternoon, the River trip to Greenwich would also be a fantastic experience for us. The reason I write to you, is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, for a fiew days. It would be exciting, if we had the possibility, to go to the show. The show includes the latest fashions in the sports clothing and the most fashionable make up and hairstyles. We all think that the London fashion and Leisure show will be a great opportunity for us. The show is free for students and we can see the show instat of having free time  Wednesday in the afternoon. We all thank you for your help. We send you our regards. The student  [SEP]  Ourdays, with the help of the media famous people, like a politician or filmstars, plays an important rule in our community. It is also normally,  that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially from their private . Who got married, who got divorsed or who had a remarkeable changing of his complexion, these are questions, who most journalists are interested in. But what  life is it, when you even can't go to a restaurant  being afraid of, the journalists,  will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people diserve also to have a private life. It is a right like everybody from us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. Is it normally when you are a star, that everybody wants to know all about you. We shoudn't forget, that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media! I think nobody have forgotten, where  curiosity from the journalists end. For example  the hunting about Princess Diana and his friend. I hope that they will  punished for what they done! ",25
513," Dear Sir: How are you? I have been  the musical show ""over the rainbow"" in your theatre last week. I have got a few things to complain about  your theart. The first thing is in your note  says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show. But in the show, there was a another actor. I was so disappointing, because I came  far away to see Danny Broke. In the note  also says that the show start at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25. The show was started at 20:15, which means it has wasted one hour of my time. Note says that tickets has discounts available, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for  thicket. When the show is finished. I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant, But I went there and it is closed for some reasons. I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can. The note says that your perfect evening out, I thought I could get my money back, with your poor service and all my reasons, But it was not ask for money back. I was really disappointed about your threat and service, I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it. Than you for reading .   [SEP]  Today, science and technology help us a lot. For example. In the pass, people have to go and get wood, make a fire and cook, but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work. Science and technology can give us a better live style or better food. For example, before people have to walk from a place to the other, but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrel transport and we can transport with them faster. We also can produce more and better food or using science and technology. e.g.  use science to put all the good part of two plants into one plant. We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster. Science and technology can also used for some material e.g. steel or iron, which use for our building, it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy. Science and technology can give us a lot of good thing for our daily life, make us easy to do thing or work. ",20
534," Dear Helen Ryan: I am writing to answer to the questions I have been asked in your previous letter. I have decided I would like to visit Camp California only in July because I have already organized an other trip for the month of august. I would rather prefer sleeping in  log cabins if its possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground. I have also chosen as activities the ones of Golf and tennis. I am rather good at these sports because I have practised them since I was a little girl. I am better at tennis that at golf but anyway I have experience in both these sports. I have also several simple questions. I would like to know how much money I have to take and what type of clothes I need. Do I have to take with me my tennis raquet and my golf bag? I would be very thankful to recieve answers to my questions. thank you. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: How are you? I'm fine. I finish school next week. I have to tell you all about the pop concert I helped to organize last month. it was really cool. I got the chance to meet Ricky Martin. Boy, He's really really handsom! I was in charge of the lights of the stage, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage. It was hard work because I have been practising for several weeks. I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lightened with a blue light or a green one. Even though I ended  terribly tired I really enjoyed myself. It was a strange experience because its something new for me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!! Well, its an experience I'll never forget as long as I live. Write to me as soon as possible, please! yours friend, ",33

482," June 17, 2000 Dear Manager, As for the ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems. Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned on the advertisement for this musical show as ""Danny Brook"". As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny's stage, I was very disappointed. I think you should have informed us of  changing  starring before starting of the show. In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was changed. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30  mentioned on the advertisement. As the third point, our tickets were not discounted at all! The Ad. says that TICKETS: Discounts Available. Lastly, your theatre restaurant had been closed already when the show was finished, because the time of begining of the show was late. As above mentioned, it can not be a ""perfect evening"". There are lots of reasons why I was so disappointed, and could not enjoy the show, you see!! Therefore,  would be grateful if you could give me back some money.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told about our plan, indeed our ""secret plan"", to Sally! How foolish! But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday-party for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been ""surprising"". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents already died when she was in the high-school. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children. In spite of such difficulties, she always shows a pretty charming smile to us. On June 2, because of Pat's fault, Sally already knew our plan. We were enjoying  at  home celebrating her birthday. Suddenly, the door was opened. ""Good Evening!"" ""Oh! You came back for me! Nigel"" Sally cried with pleasure. Nigel himself was a big ""surprising"" present for Sally. I never forget her happy face ..... We spent a brilliant night. ",25
1117," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing in the name of the whole class. First of al, I want to thank you for the interesting programme, which you already have organised. It is very good, especially the Sightseeing tour by bus. However, we have seen an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London. There we can see everything about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. The entrance for student is free. This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education. Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon. The shopping could be done after the river trip to Greenwich but only if we have enough time. I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Will the home of the future really look different? It's quite difficult to say, but of course there will be a change. For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home  with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern, especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom. in the future it could be that you don't have to prepare your breakfast by your own, perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone . In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table, tidying up the house,  doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners. The place to spend the night will still be the bed. The livingroom won't get any big changes although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult. In general we can say the huge change we already had, but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us? Let's have a surprise? ",32
697," Dear Sir/ Madame, Today a recived your letter, it is the most wonderful news I here in a long time. I am so please that I won this prize, that I can not explain how greateful I am. I wasen't expecting this prize because  was to good to be true. My family decide to visit my grandmother in Orlando, because she got some problems with the swiming-pool, she ask my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building. Because  this situation I  be very busy on the first week of july, and I  apreciate  if you can give me the choice to start my ""Camp California""  from July 10th. About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents, because I never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins. Because I seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very kind on this sport, and also I love photography because I got a great Camara. I am really looking forward to see you soon.  [SEP]  When I was a child I never like to go shopping because my Mum spend so much time on the shops that I remember  going shopping with her, was a nigthmare. It is ameaising how people change during the years, for example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something. I enjoy so much fashion that my life change completely since I start to study clothes designer and I discover that fabrics,  colors, are really enjoyable. But in this days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer  and you pay  full price, on the end of the season it is half price, I find  very anfair for people who pay a lot of money on their clothes. Anyway, shopping is allways a satisfation for rich people, because they can afforded  and they don't main to spend  full price on their clothes. ",18
87," Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to complain about my deceiveful experience at your theatre last Saturday night. What I thought it was going to be a wonderful night became into the worst night at the theatre I've ever had. Firstly, I must admit that when we realised the main character had been changed we felt really disappointed. This is because I had been waiting to enjoy Danny Brook's performance since I saw him the first time on television. Secondly, despite of your advertisement of the possibility of discounts, when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole prize. Moreover, not only had the actor been changed but also the musical show started forty five minutes late. In my opinion you ought to be more serious because of the commitent you have  with the people who comes to your theatre. Finally, at the end of the night we felt a bit hungry but we couldn't eat until  arriving home due to your restaurant new cooker illness. The truth is the night wasn't my perfect night out as you have announced so I would appreciate  if you could give  my money back. I wait to receiving a prompt answer from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had always thought that I could rely on her whatever my problem was. Yet, one extremly hot day while I was pacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems I discovered my elder brother's girlfriend with another boy. At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen. Nevertheless, when I found him studying harder for his final exams I realised I would rather her girlfriend explained my poor brother the truth. But the thing is I needed to speak to someone about the fact so I could feel more relaxed. I didn't know who explain it to but actually I decided that if I needed to tell someone a secret I would trust an my best friend Pat. So, the next day, I nervously came to Pat's appartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen. After that, she felt completely sad because of the love she had been feeling for my brother for several years and she swore  me that she was going to tell it to nobody. However, the truth was that not sooner had I arrived home than my brother asked me crying why I had told his girlfriend's affair to Pat instead of discovering him the truth. ",31
220," Dear manager, Last week I went to the Circle theatre, of which you are responsable, to se the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had joined the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you have changed the program. Moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19.30; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket's price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner. So it was not ""my perfect evening out"" and because of my disappointment I am here to ask you  some money back.  [SEP]  I think modern technology has changed human's life a lot, expecially starting with the last century. The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out: I live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so I cannot go to the city using a bycicle. Because of my ""isolation""  telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and  internet so study or do researches, because there are not  book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like very much play guitar, and in my free time I prefer play electric, than acoustic or classic guitar using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible. ",25
875," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy for win the competition. I believe I have the appropriate qualification to stay two weeks at camp California. It could be wonderful to see you as soon as possible. First of all, I will be able to travel in July  because I have not finished school. Althoug I wich that my accommodation at Camp California it must be in  tents. I get experience in the last summer. Secondly, I am very keen at sports. Specially at sailing and swimming. Anyway I am hard working for the word cup at sailing. Finally, I would like to know how is the weather in July? Because I have to prepare all my staf and I am sure it would be a great experience despite the cost of living. I look forward to hearing for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you for my birthday's present. Sorry about my last mail but I've been traveled. I didn't tell you about my last job, you remember last moth I've helped at a pop concert. Anyway, it was fantastic you can't imagine how was the concert like? However, I was responsible for check in for the entrance then I must gave a sit to everyone. Anyway I enjoed  so much. I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphier was really good. I shouldn't forgot my experience in my  life. Did you remember the computer curse that we took together it was very useful to clasifay each person in the concert. So keep in touch. A lot of love, ",22
463," Dear Manager, I have recently seen ""Over the rainbow"" and I must tell you that I'm really disappointed! I found the advertisement about this show in a newspaper and thought it would be fun. I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring, I booked the ticket imagetly. But, instead there was a different actor, who I never heard about before! The show should start at 19.30, but it didn't start until 20.15! So, because of that, I missed my last bus home! While we were waiting for the show to start, we were thinking of going to the restaurant. In fact, it was closed the whole evening, because of some work . As I'm a student, I usually get discounts on different things, so I was so disappointed when I couldn't get it here! I'm really upset and disappointed after all this and at least I want my money back! It could have been a perfect evening out, but it wasn't! yours sincerely Karol Johannes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? I belong to this generation who had grown up with a lot of different technolgy. For example TV, telephone, micrown etc. But  the last few years, it has change and so many new important things had been discovered. What I'm talking about are the computer, which now can be found in almost every home and of course, the mobile phone! I tought I would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I can't live without it! But the discovery that I'm most thankful to is the computor and the Internet! Thanks to it, I can easy communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England. It's so quick and not too expensive either. To use the mobile phone by the way, is very expensive. I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends. So, I start every day,  swiching on my mobile phone, to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e-mail and that's just the begining of the day... Karol Johannes ",33
465," Dear Sir, My name is Yakimo Nashoto, I study in France and I went to London just to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because all my friends told me that it was ""great"". However, when I saw it, I was really disapointed and I  ask you  some money back. The reasons why I was disappointed were : First of all, Danny Brook was not there, I was very upset because he is my favorite singer and it was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show. Then, the show started t 20.15 pm instead of 19.30. My Euro Star was at 22 pm. As you can see, I missed my train to go back to Paris. On the developpement, they also said that they will be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but it was totally wrong because I paid the full price which was £20. Finally, I wanted to buy something to drink,  the restaurant was closed because it was on a bank holiday! As a conclusion, it was the worse evening I have ever had in my life so I  ask you for  money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my daily life a lot. First of all,  Internet makes my life easier. Some of my friends live in overseas, we keep in touch by e-mails, it is a very good way for communicating because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read mails and keep them forever. Then, nine persons out of ten have a mobile phone in our society. I have one too! It is very useful for several reasons: when I want to call someone, I don't need to look after a phone box. people can phone me at anytime they want from everywhere when I go out, sometimes my parents are worried so they phone to me  if everything is going alright. Finally, there is a TV in my parent's car. We can watch TV, there is also a map so when we get lost, it is very east to find out the place. As a conclusion, I agree that modern technology has changed my daily life but I am sure that in the future, my life will not be the same as now because more modern technology will appear.  ",29
822," Dear Helen, Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize. It seems so exciting. I really look forward to taking part at Camp California. I would like to travel in July because my examination will be finished on June 15th. And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August. So, I think July is the best time to go for the Camp. In addition, the weather may be nice at that period of time. For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I get used to it. Because I'm not good at sporting, so I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying in the university I joined the Photo Club where I got the knowledge a well as a wide variety of knowhow in taking photo. As I love singing and always spend my free time in Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad. I also have a couple of things to ask you. What type of clothes and how much money do I need to prepare? I would be delightful if you could recommend me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to do shopping a lot when I was in the university. I was 19 years old but I spend over 200 pounds in some weeks just to make myself up-to-date all the time. I bought lots of new fashion clothes, bags and shoes. Four years in the university I never had  saving money. Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young as mentioned so it came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money. I found that it's not worth when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They are very poor. The money that I spent on shopping can help them a lot if I would not do it before. Little grandson tried to help his grandfather who was 70 years old by hiring himself out as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing tell me shopping is not enjoyable any more. ",31
597," Dear Helen, Thank you very much for your letter which said I had won first prize in your competition. I was really surprise to hear that. I am afraid I can only make it on July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University on August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July. The accommodation I prefer is  tent. I haven't tied it before. I would like to know how interesting it is to live in tents. If I can only choose two activities while I am at the Camp, I would like climbing and Basketball. I started climbing since I was a child. I love it very much. About the Basketball, I have been played it for seven years. I would like to play basketball with local people at the Camp to see how good they are, if I can. Finally, may I ask  some more informations. What kinds of clothes shall I take? how about the weather there? Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip. Also, may I take a friend with me, how much will she pay? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, JIA LI LO  [SEP]  To: Teacher Cheng From: Jia Lo Date: 13/06/00 Subject: a short video about daily life at school As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions of this short video. I found that most of them had suggested that four lessons should be filmed which  as follow: 1. Grammer, which is the base of learning English. 2. Speaking, it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper. Let you do more pratices. 3. Listening, it  really helpful for improving your listening and understanding. 4. Writing, this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write. Also, there are two activities  should be filmed. 1. Students are talking to each other when they are having  break. It is important to pratise your English after lessons. 2. Teacher are helping students with their problems. If you have  problem on studing,  asking  teachers  is the best way . In Conclusion, the short video is only 60 minutes. It must show the daily lifes of the English students at the school. It should include all those points lists above. ",25
136," Dear Sir/Madam, I was to  Circle Theatre to watch  'Over the rainbow' musical show, recently. I was trully dissapointed by it. My expectations were high after I've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as 'London's newest and best musical show'. Now, I can assure you it wasn't. Firstly, it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star. The substitute was far worse. Secondly, I had to wait fourty-five minutes before the show finally began. Another unkept promise are the discounts. There weren't any! Lastly, when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed. You can believe me it wasn't 'my perfect evening out' and I have no other choice than asking  to give  my money back. I paid for something I didn't get so it is obvious that I want my money back. I got the £15 ticket. I'd like you to send the money to this adress; ul Taklowa 10 Skoclow 43-430 POLAND Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days the whole school knew. When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh. Paul couldn't stand it. He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind. He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do. Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him. They were no longer friends. 'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'. As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him. He turned around and saw... Jean. 'What are you dong here, why aren't you at school?' she asked. Paul was like paralyzed. He couldn't reply. 'I had heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'. Paul couldn't believe his ears. While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school. When they entered everyone became silent. All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat isn't that bad at all. ",30
985," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in order to give you some further information that you enquired for the Camp California. First of all, I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment. I am allowed to take holiday only in July. Concerning accommodation, I would prefer to stay in log cabins. Log cabins are bigger, more stable and usually more comfortable than tents. As requested, I have choosed two activities - sailing and surfing. I am quite experienced in surfing - I have participated  some competitions - whereas  not at all experienced in sailing. I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp. Also, I would like to know if there is going to be  qualified instructor for activities since I am a beginning in sailing as mentioned before. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Kan Seo  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? Thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you. I'm sorry I haven't written before, but as you know, I've been very busy because I was helping at a pop concert last month. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I helped people setting  and decorating the concert hall which was great help for my major subject - You know that my subject is design. I also had to distribute the flyers. What I particularly enjoyed was meeting the famous musicians I have been dreaming  to see. The day I shaked their hands, I though I was over the moon! I will never forget that day. Write son and let me know what you have been doing. Lots and lots of kisses, ",32
370," Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called ""Over the rainbow"" with my wife and children. We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one. First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people  came to see him. However the man who took his place made a good performance, we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing. The times were not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold. As it started later, it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take. Furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual! In my opinion, the tickets were a little bit expensive and not many people could afford the price. We did not see any discounts! Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came before. I understand them. After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place. For these reasons I would like to have my money back because it was not a ""perfect evening"" as you said. But I think that if you take care more of the public, your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology is everywhere in our society. We use it daily and sometimes don't realize that things are changing in our daily life. The ways of transport are improving a lot this times. The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling. But cars created pollution: for exemple the green house effect. But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport  as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities. Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in  sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older. I think there is a link between technology and  sciences because they need each other:  sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches in  sciences. Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with  Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations I need for my studies. In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary because it's faster and you really find what you need. Furthermore we can find everything all the time. Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could be also dangerous if we don't use it in the good way.  ",30
90," Mr Manager: A few days ago I went to London to have a nice holiday. I was expecting to have fun, so I decided to go to the play ""Over the Rainbow"", thats now presenting in your theatre. I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent evening. From the beggining it was all a disappointment. When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card, but that was not posible. I let this pass and I bought it anyway, thinking that  was posible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement. But the play started fourty-five minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan an who was the mainly reason of why I decided to see the play, was changed for another actor, how turned out to be really bad. You will understand how upseting all this was, and I decided to visit your restaurant, thinking that could save my visit to the theatre, but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry. I think you realized why I'm writting this letter to ask you to give  my money back. All the thing that were promised in your advertisement were not true, and it was definitly NOT the perfect evening out. Specting that you will solve this misunderstanding.  [SEP]  There's no doubt that modern tecnology has changed our lives, but how? I think that some of the changes had been very good, like the impruvement to the medical science, that now can saved millions of persons that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives. It has changed the ways in how people comunicate. First the telegraph and the radio an now TV, the telephone and the Internet allowed people be in contact with others really quickly and distances arent now so difficult of overcome. But tecnology had not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us thing that can make our lives more confortable, it had also  thing that arent bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world. The weapons and the factories are destroing our planet and we need to realized that we have to use tecnology to impruve our lives, but always triying to respect nature. ",26
204," Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening to your theatre. and I would like to explain what the problems were. Firstly, as I read at the advertisment,  the actor would be Danny Brook and this is one of the reasons why I came to the theatre. But at  big suprise  I saw that the actor was different and I was very disappointed. Secondly, on the article the times were 14:30 and 19:30. I prefered to come at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the theatre started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting  to start. Another reason why I was disappointed was that you said there would be  discount available but there wasn't. At last I was waiting to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken. This was very disappointing. As you can see there were many problems with the theatre and I would like to ask for some money back as an alternative Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The next morning at school everybody was looking at me with a strange way. Nobody was talking to me except the ten persons who I invited to my party. At first I didn't know why but after a few seconds I realised that telling Pat about my party wasn't a good idea. I was very ungry with her, I didn't know what to do I was afraid that I would have lost all my friends. After a few seconds of thoughts I went straigh to Pat. ""Why, why did you do that?"" I said she looked as if she didn't want to talk to me. I ignored her I couldn't do anything now. Everybody knew about my party and I had invited only ten persons. I was confused. I wondered why I made the mistake  to invite Pat. I guess I didn't know that she would have said it. After a big confusion I decided not to make a party for my birthday so I could had all my friends back. And that's what I had exactly done even if I stayed alone at my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back. With this story I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends and who you can trust. ",33

However, I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful. the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is  Palace Hotel, to get there you must go to the centre of town, all  buses are going there, Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office.

Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Chairs are not only part of the forniture, they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols. Who could have invented such a useful item? In fact, nobody has got this clue, but it must have been the most clever person on earth! the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs, from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices. From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented. Some people use them in their work, others are wishing to get  one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement. Although  is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us. ",25
901," Mrs Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize of the competition of which I need more information. To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to travell. Well, I would be only available in July, because at that time I would be in  winter holidays. Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent than  in a long cabin because it is easier to clean. You mentioned the chance to choose two activities from you list. I would like to do tennis, because I used to play when I was at school and swiming because I like water sports and because I am good at it. Could you also let me know what kind of clothes and how much money I would have to take. Thanking you in anticipation for your help, I look forward to hearin from you. Yours sincerely, KA. FELIPA MUNOZ  [SEP]  To: The Teacher From: Ka. Felipa Munoz Subject: Suggest lessons and activities to be film.

GYM There is a well equipated gym where students of all ages can practise any kind of sport in their free time. theater This is an extra activity where you can take part in a play. You can sing, act or just help with the backstage. CONCLUSION To sum up, it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optionaly activities to do in your free time. ",32
882," Dear Sir/Madam I am glad to hear from you recently and I really appreciate your invitation to California. I would like to tell you about my preference. To start with I would rather stay in a log cabin because two weeks might be too long to stay in a tent and a log cabin would be more convenient for me. When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident with this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym would retrieve my concerning. In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular especially in California. And I also have to ask you what kinds of clothes will be suitable there. Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy surveniers because this will be  first time for me to visit Carifolnia. Finaly, I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work. Thank you very much for your time and I am looking forward to visiting there. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Needless to say, shopping can cause you a waste of time and money. However some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable. Those who love shopping are usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping. However, things which you can get by money  necessarily fill your unsatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be bigger. And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners. What you want is often different from what your friend wants. Unless either you or your partner is really tolerant, shopping could result in another stress. So it is advisable not to make a friend whose hobby is shopping. In addition to these, everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you how  silly decision you had done at the moment. On the whole, shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh be extravacant, lose your friends and have what you don't need. ",28
419," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to express how I was dissatisfied with OVER THE RAINBOW which was presented by the Circle Theatre. First of all, the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook, who is my favorite star, and was going to play for the show. However, there was a different actor instead of him, and this was most my disappointment. Moreover, as your advertisement, we would get  discount price for the ticket, but it was not available. Although the show was supposed to start at 19=30, it started at 20=15, so I had to wait for an hour. To make matters worse, because of the late starting, the theatre restaurant had already closed after the show finished. I wonder if you could give me a refund for that, because the show was extremely different  which I was expected. I hope you would take immediate action for that. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Our daily life with modern technology Science and technology are necessary for our life. I could say that we can not servive without them. Nowadays,  especially computer technology is improving, therefore, we can get any kinds of information as much as we require. It is getting more convinient and useful than our past life. Further more, it is possible to cure many patients who have serious desease more effectively, if we use modern technology for medical science. However, if we rely on modern technology too much, it is difficult to be independent, otherwise we will tend to not consider or solve a problem by ourselves. From my point of view, it is great that science and technology improve for our life. Because of convinience, we can spend  time more effectively, but we should not be rely on these  too much. ",25
1201," Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information. We have already booked a 4 stars hotel -  Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames. It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train. The end-of-conference party will be held in an India restaurant, that is next to the hotel. It is surposed to be held during 7 pm to 11 pm. Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and  disco is also provided. You can wear anything you like, we would like you to be just yourself and have fun. As you know, our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year. There are so many things to do, unfortunately, there is just 3 hours. I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping. So you can buy gifts for your friends or families. I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts, please do not hestitate to contact us. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, our lives is becoming better and better. Lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely. If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television. ""Televisions is just an amazing invention."" My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are the other countries like, or even what language they speak unless we go to that country. Secondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as ""Learn follow me"" and ""Be good to others"". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child. The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't. If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, that's easy,  just turn on the television and enjoy myself. However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I do think televisions is the most important invention. ",32
116," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain some aspects about your show. It was a desaster and I am  telling you why. I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, but I had a bad surprise; he was not in the show! How could you change the actors without saying something to the visitors. The show was supposed to start at half past seven and started a quarter past eight. Forty-five minutes later! It was incredible. Apart from that, the advertisement mention that there were discounts available, and there were not. It mention that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show, too, and we could not because it was closed, and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us. I am very disappointed, and if it is possible, I want you to return my money back. I hope that the next time you will do a better show than the last one. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For me technology affects me a lot may be more than science, because my daily life is plenty of objects with technology, such us television, radio, transports, etc. But it has advantatges as   disadvantatges. On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watching television or listening to music. Or if I want to go shopping or to another city, it is necessary to use the car or the public transport. On the other hand there are disadvatatges, too. Firstly, the enviroment is polluted because of technology, although  is our fault. Secondly for us  is a disadvantatge because the pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watching television, and it isn't very good at all. And finally, because I spend a lot of money buying games for the computer, that it's a very good technology, too. To sum up, technology it's the best thing around the world, apart from T.V. ",27
279," Dear Sirs, Two weeks ago, I came to London for a week's holiday. During my stay in your city, I had the opportunity to assist to your show named 'Over the rainbow' after having read an advertisement in the magazine 'Going-out' of the 1st of June . I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay  full price. Then, even if we could enter in the room, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expects. Indeed, we are still waiting on Danny Brook who was not in the piece. And last, at the end of the program, we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance. As this evening was for my family and I a wasted one, I permit myself to ask you for  refund. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully JANN BRUL  [SEP]  There is no need to be a genious to notice that technology has evoluated so considerably during the last  decades that our everyday life has changed. From my point of view, modern technology has first permit to me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer. In this domain, you have to afford everyday the development of new technology. And as new discoveries bring new discoveries, progress is going faster and faster. The advantage of this is that you need to   interest yourself in all if you don't want to be put on the side. And so, your life is not boring at all as you learn new things everyday. In the other hand, you cannot stay quiet for 2 week as some new inventions come out every day. Finally, new technology have a great influence on my life as it permits me to live on. But, who knows, may be one day I will develop  technology that will send me right to the unemployment office!

769," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition. It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it. I am writing this as a reply for you request to provide you with some information about my preferencies. First off all I'll prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free. I'll have to pass several exams in June, in August my family going to visit our relatives in Austria. I am not so keen about  accomotation but would rather stay in tents than cabins. It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and a company of your friends. It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I am really enjoying swimming. We live near the sea shore and swimming is the sport activitie I am really good in. Far the best swimmer in my school. The other subject is photography. I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more then just good. Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be better to take with me, what I'll need at Camp? How much money should I take, will it be any guided tours? And how many will be in  Camp in July? Hope to hear from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. My best friend is crazy about shopping. She will prefer shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant  spending of time, when you going from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Somitimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a sense of living. And it's so many people like her. Lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center, and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping. Not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more. They forgot how beautiful could be the countryside, and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums. People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied. People are not smiling to each other, not talking to each other at the shops. They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy. In my opinion shopping is just  to cover our basic needs. Shops are not for spending our lifes in them. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together. It feels much more better. You'll have happy memories and  a good mood. ",27
25," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about the International Arts Festival which has just finished. I congratulated with you because it has been a great idea since the town needed a cultural event. I especially appreciate the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford, also students like me. However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances. You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have appreciate seeing more of them. For next year's edition, you could possibly add some foreign films, like the Chinese ones, which I most like. Finally, in order to make  a really international festival, I think you should invite artists from all over the world, not just from six countries like this year. I hope that you will appreciate my opinions and suggestions, which I have shared with my friends.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Simply a good idea and that's enough Are you young and full of life but you don't have enough money to enjoy your spare time? Simply let your brain work and you could find out wonderful ideas to earn money enjoying yourself. Are you fed up of looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend. Are you keen on music and you love going to disco? With a short training  you'll be able to mix songs at parties. You won't dance but the earning is guarantee! Do you like do-it-yourself and your house is full of marvellous but unuseful things? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room!  So, what are  waiting for? Work out your own idea and realise it: money won't be a problem for you anymore! ",34
457," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to the musical show I saw last week in your theatre. I hoped that it would be the most excited evening during my week's holiday in London. Unfortunately it wasn't. I wouldn't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information. First of all, when I had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available. Secondly, I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone didn't excuse. Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook, which is my favourite actor, didn't play in the show. Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed. Finally, I must say that I had a very disappointing evening and I would like to get my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I wish I had know it two days ago... Exacly on 15th June we were at the birthday party. Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him. I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea. I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin. It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us. Yesterday I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony. I really regret that I was so foolish. The most horrible  is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I don't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties. ",33
149," 17 May 2000 Dear Sir or Mam, Last weak, I went to London to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". I was realy happy to see the ""Best Musical Show"" in London. But what I saw was exactly the opposite  I expected. In other words, it was a disaster. Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why  were no discounts avaivable? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors  which were not very good in acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed. It wasn't realy a perfect evening like you promised on your flyer. I was very disapointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was. Yours faithfully, Franz Morell Hand  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Unfortunately, modern technology made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for  holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need. Every production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for  worker anymore. Every thing is controlled and produced by machines. This also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to. You never get bored. ",28
549," Dear Sir/madam, Thank you for your letter and your congratulations. I never thought that I would win the competition. It is really wonderful. I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right for that time. And for my accommodation. I  prefer live in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I  like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I live in. I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming. Before I came  England, I swam every weekend in my country even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp. Actually, my mind has already gone there, I can't wait even for a minute. I want to go there now. By the way, I would like to know  the shopping especially for clothes, I want to buy some for myself. And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there? I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  To: Mr Ted From: Meng Subject: About daily life at our school Introduction This report is aim to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestion about it. What do students do now? Lots of student normally have classes in the morning. And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon. For instance, reading, looking for some information or using  computer. What do they think about it? The arts students want to learn another foreign language. Moreover, some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that aim to the examination. Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon. Recommendations Open some foreign language classes at part-time for the students who is interested in it. Let foreign students do more excises about English to help them pass the exam. Using the equipment and area what we have to organise some activities. ",26
30," Ideas to improve the Festival Dear Jane Clark, I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I write to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not. Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is International. But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all  the world and I saw only six nationalities. Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent and the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year. Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. It attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that. Finally, the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind of people an afford to buy it. I also think that you should put a Snack-Bar or a little restaurant so as the people are not too hangry and morever you can realise big benefits In conclusion, in the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve . I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Home and school rules Dear Andrew, I receive your letter and thank you for it. I am very happy to hearing from you and I hope that you are fit. As expected, I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home. As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000. In our class, we don't have  problem with students who dislike to work, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there  years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long. In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons. It is the same in our family and for example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that I let dust everywhere. When I go out, they don't give me an hour to be at home, because I don't exagerate. In conclusion, I don't want to change something in my house or at school, because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have. I hope these few  information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you Best wishes ",26
514," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to a musical show I saw recently in your theatre. The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star Danny Brook, but there was an other actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook In addition, the performance started 45 minutes later, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it had been closed already. More over, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and me are both on  pension. As a result our evening was completely spoiled. So I am sure you will understand why I  so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partly refund. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce, Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it  herself. Her father had met another woman who had not been as pretty as Maria's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary. One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter. All  fathers things were missing. They could not believ their eyes. They read the letter and slowly went onto the kitchen. Maria bought his favorite food and she throw it away into the bin. How he could have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years. They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot. Now everything was over. She went to skool, but she could not pick the material up as easy as she used to. So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat. She was so understanding. Now everyone knows about her sad story  that makes her feel even more worse. ",30
84," Dear Mrs. Clark, The International Arts Festival was very interesting including the fact that Stars and artists had also come from around the world.   I enjoyed it tremendously.  Later I found out that the stars and artists had only come from six countries. Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were clasics as well.  The only thing that distracted me was the size of the concert halls.   They were very small and I was pushed by everyone. There were wonderful plays and films which I hope that there would have been more .  All the other shows such as dance shows, art exhibition and talks by writers were very amusing. I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably-priced for all events.  I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days in the Arts Festival at the end. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Once upon a time there was a widow and a widower.  They treated each other as if they were husband and wife. Around two years later there was a meeting.  By that time the widow could not walk and the widower could not see.  When the widower sensed that the widow badly wanted to go, the widow clung on the widower's back and set off telling him where to go. On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.  The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.  They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.  He came and said to the widower that he was to bring him on his back.  The widow who was afaid told the man of the gold. When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.  He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake into half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle. The man went back to the widower and kicked him.  The widower was confused and they went to the lake.  They were very surprised when they found out the gold was cut in half.  They lived happily ever after.   This story happened a long time ago. ",32
824," Dear Mrs Ryan I am writing in connection with the competition I entered a month ago. I received your letter, and I was delighted to know that I won it. As requested, below are some further information and some enquiries. I would be able to travel only after the end of my exams which are taking place in June. So, I think that July would suit me best. As far as accomodation is concerned, I would prefer sleeping in a tents. I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accomodation is part of the ritual. I would enjoy a lot playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good in it. In addition I would love to follow the photography classes eventhough I have never tried to take a picture before. I hope I gave you all the information you needed. From my part, I would just like to know what sort of clothes should I bring with me and also how much money. Thanking you in advance, I am looking forward to your prompt respons to my enquiries Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I got your letter yesterday and I was really glad to hear from you... it's been ages since you last wrote to me! I've done so many thinks and between them I went to Glastonbery (as you know)! It lasted three days and I've had the best fun of my life. I went as a voluntier staff in order to go for free. I had to help the Green Peace teems to recycle everything we could. We were more or less two hundred students doing the same job. Our duty was to work eight ours each day and then we were free to enjoy the rest of the day as we liked. The accomodation and the food were part of the contract... everything free. They provided us  tents and also a VIP pass in order to get food. Oh my God!!! It has been the best experience you can Imagine. I met lots of nice and cool people, and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmospher of the hole thing. No matter how hard we had to work, everyone had always humor and  a positive mood. So, I'll sign off now and I hope you'll write soon. Lots of love Irene ",28
110," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about the show, that I have recently attended to at your theatre. During my visit there occurred some problems, that made my evening completely disappointing. Firstly, as I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. Not only the play started 45 minutes after it was planned, but as the actors eventually appeared at the stage, have I also seen, that Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information  given about the reason of it's closure. As you see, my evening in your theatre absolutely wasn't perfect. I hope I will get a full refund. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Have you ever thought of a year 2100? Do you think, that  world will be different from  current world then? I would answer ""yes"" for both questions. And if I were asked, what will be completely different in  year 2100, I would say: clothes. Most of the scientists, when asked about the Earth in a hundred years claim, that it is going to be absolutely scorching here then. In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more,  ground will be so hot, that going will only be possible in huge shoes, which should be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be, that people won't be allowed to get out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials, that aren't known yet. On the whole, we can only predict what clothes will be like in  year 2100. But in case my predictions are right, maybe you should buy a new pair of shorts? ",31
70," Dear Sir, First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea. I enjoyed it and found  worthy to visit. The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with the stars and artist coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get used to more cultures by inviting  from some other countries too. The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in. So I could hardly participated in all of the concerts. The organisation was very good I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year. It was really a reasonably-priced weekend for me, but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs,  drawing a portrate next year. Then it would be excellent. Thanks for everything. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, I have received your letter. It is nice to hear from you again. I'm in a hurry, so I will directly come to the point. Everywhere and  everytime in our lives we face with the rules. Some find them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them. For me they are both. At schools we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk. I think these are international rules which help things to go in order. Contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and  feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in   wearing. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study  or if we are ill. At homes we have again rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to  dining table, respectful, do your home works and watch TV less and not too loud. I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power. They are against democracy I think. Anyway hope to hear from you soon. With all my love, ",33
715," Dear Helene Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am glad to know that I have won first prize in your competition. Now, I am writing to you to ask  some details about these two weeks at Camp California and giving  some answers to your questions. First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am in holidays. About the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  tents as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club for five years and earned a few competitions. Secondly, I am very interesting in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time each other. We had a lot of fun during our last holidays and we took a lot of pictures. As the instructions about clothes and money were not enclosed in your letter, I request about it and ask you to include in it. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A lot of people like doing shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes  is not always enjoyable. And nowadays people must do shopping either they like it or not. For people who used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and  they are always looking for fashioned-clothes. But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like  the sales period, I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring. In my opinion, I think people have to do shopping even though they don't appreciate it very much. If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people. And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety. ",28
133," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show I saw in your theatre a week ago. Although the show was supposed to be the London's newest and best musical show, I am rather disappointed with it. Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage. However, you changed actors without informing  viewers. As if this were not enough, the show was forty five minutes late. Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject. According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused being given a discount. On top of everything, the theatre restaurant was closed. You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening. I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Recently, we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones,  internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through  internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients. However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing  computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon cars from city centres,  closed down factories which produce too much sewage. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably. ",34
444," Dear Sir, Madam, I am writing to complan about your service. Last Sunday I went to the Circle Theatre. I watched a musical show which  called 'Over the Rainbow'. I was very disappointed  it. Because there were other actors  which played too badly. I don't understand why you changed them. I hoped to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove as was presented in an advertisement. You had to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started too late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to people. Why did you put into the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? It wasen't!!! Any kinds of tickets were  original prase. After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed because there someone has fixed something. I had the very disappointing evening so I would like to ask for return my money . I got the ticket for £20. I am hearing to looking fermards from you. Yours faithfully, Ilya V.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I knew that but I needed someone who could understent and support me at that moment. I told to her about my pregnency because she has  friend who works in a hospital as a doctor. I asked her for hepl and she promised me  do everythings what she can and keep my secret. Pat gave same advise for me and I disayded to have an operetion. In a week time my classmates and teachers started to toking from me. I understand who told my secret to everyone. I got the big dipress but my parents supported me. We had a big conversation. They stopped me to do the operetion. Then I was 15 years old. Now I am 16 and I have got  nice baby boy. My family very love him  and support us. I still go to school and I have plan go to a college on next year. I would like to tell to everyone, don't be naive when you share with sameone your big secret or promlem. First tell to your parents. I am sure it is the best way. Ofcoure secrets can be different...

469," Dear Sirs, I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow. On Saturday, June 5th, 2000 my wife and I wanted to spend a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical. When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as  mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones. After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated. So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink. To make the matters worse Danny Brook who was announced as one of the starring person in the musical was not acting this evening. You can imagine how disappointed we were especially  the acting of Danny Brook was the main reason for us  to see the musical. On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities. As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it wasn't a perfect evening out I would like to have 50% of the prize of the tickets back. I am looking forward to your promt reply. yours faithfully, Heine Bitz  [SEP]  What would we wear in 100 years time? Fashion will always be an interesting and important subject for all ages. Today the fashion industrie has a great importance in the commercial market. In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but the fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way. Firstly, the material of which clothes are made has  a wide range. There are the natural material on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produce more and more syntetical clothes, which relay on the production cost. In 100 years most of the clothes are made from syntetical material. Beyond  colours will play an important role in the next century for the fashion. Light and bright colours will be very common. Especially contrast will be attractiv. Furthermore the style of the clothes are going to be more crazy and individuell but there will be still enumerous clothes for the solid people. One balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable and colourful. The fashion industry will deliver a wide range of vararity in style, material and colour. There will be clothes for everyones tast. ",30
1207," Dear Mrs. Smith, In reply to your letter, I would like to answer your questions and give you more information. Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is  'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and  no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party would be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you could wear something quite casual. Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount. I hope this letter should help you with enough information. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Could modern people live without a light bulb? Well, I don't think so. Only people who could live without it, must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation! We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly  happens! Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply. I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in  toilet, all the light was turned off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be, and I was sure I can never, ever live without it. ",34
1242," Neuchâtel, 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I thank you for your recent letter. First, I would like to congratulate  on your new responsability,  because of Mr Brown's illness. I give you with great pleasure all the details needed. Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly in front of the bus station. To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy. You have to take the bus number 1 and get off at ""Black House"", which is the third stop. After the conference, at about 8 pm. a party is organised. During it, everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference. Food and beverages will be available. After the cocktail, the Band ""Zero one"" is playing their famous songs. The clothes, required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women. Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to make a sightseeing tour in our city. I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Report on the ""Paintings Museum"" In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too. Location The museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the ""Delamuraz Hotel"". It is close to the main road, and at 300 meters of the station. Outside The building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to pas through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your swim suit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in  pools. Inside When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. There were all painting during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceilar. Everything in this room is about wine. To learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor. I particularly recommend you to visit the ""blue"" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door. According to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed. Conclusion To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself. You won't be disappointed. The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden. ",34
841," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I'm writing  you in response to your letter, I was delighted to know that I won the first price. With reference to the date, I only can go on July, as I'm going off on holiday on August, and I start university on September. The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more confortable than in a tent. It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities. The ones I'm most keen on are Tennis, in which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and Painting, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems. I think I'm not bad at painting either, at least everyone in my family likes my work, includying myself. Anyway, there are some questions I'd like to ask you: What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer, and how much money do you think I'll need? I'm waiting forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Manela B.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm so sorry I haven't written until now, but you know I'm always very busy. As I told you in my last letter, last month I worked for a pop band, and helped them at a concert in Barcelona. It was such a great experience! Basically my work was carrying the instruments, the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage, which is not an easy work because, as you can imagine, it's not exactly light stuff. But the most exciting part was meeting the band, mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good-looking. Anyway, I had  lot of fun working for them. I hope they call me soon, I'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again... I'd better leave now. I hope you write again soon. Manela B. ",38
486," 17th - June - 2000 Auda. Lolas 44 MADRID 23456 SPAIN Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the rainbow"" taking part  the 15th of June The last week I have been to London for a holiday. There is saw the advertisement for this show and I decided to go there. I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible. In the advertisement you told me I would have  discounts. This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I was waiting fourty five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. When it started the main actor Danny Brook was not in , another worse actor was taken his part. In my opinion when the main actor can not do the show it is better not do the show than do it with a horrible actor. When it finished I arrived at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they are going to do a new better restaurant. In my opinion you should refuse my money because the evening and the show were so terrible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I have fell in love with Paul a friend of us. No one know it else her. The wendsday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also love Paul. I had also told Sally my secret. The thursday Sally phoned me, because we are also friends, but she did not tell me anything about Paul. The weekend started and this Friday we went to the dyscoteque. I spent there a good time but at the end , when we were going to come back home, I saw Sally kissing Paul!! It was terrible!! When Sally came out  the dyscotheque I was very nervous and I started to shout  her. She hit me and I decided in this moment that I never should speak with her . Paul ask Pat what had happened and she told him my secret. One friend of mine told me that Pat had told Paul my secret and I went to speak with her. Now we are friends but I know that I can not tell her any secret. ",23
1050," 12.12.0 Dear Mr Robertson; I am writing in reference to the programme for the English class, that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I agree with that, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to  River trip to Greenwich, Also, they can visit  Science Museum, and they can going to the shopping, on Wednesday 15 March they  going to visit The National Art Gallery, really, I think that is  good programme. However, I think as well, that the class would like to visit ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"",  is on Tuesday from 10.00 AM until 19.00 pm. They don't need to pay. In addition, I think  is a good a idea, because they could go after shopping, when they have a free time, I am sure about that, they will like to visit that place. However, the programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody. Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand  accept you personal opinion as well. I look forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  12.12.00 My personal opinion about famous people, is  good in one way and bad in another way. I think that they live their life like hat, because they want to live this life. They doing everything just for money,  sometimes, they can make theirs life easier than they  normally do. It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalist following them all the time, however this news give them money, and  confortable life. Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, they live happy, because they know that the famous mean to be rich. They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be a very good peaple, because ""the Famous"" is just for a few time, nothing is forever in this world. My personal opinion is that, I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well. I do not really like will be a famous person, because you are not really yourselfh, and for me  is the more important thing. Your faithfully ",23
1223," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning. Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are comeing now. You asked me which hotel the group had been booked . It is the Palace hotel, about a mile away  where the conference will take place. The best way to get there, is to take the bus number 7. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will leave the bus at ,,Royal gardens"". Turn left and go straight to ,,Baker street"" At the need of this street there is the house number 18. This is our college. You wish to know all about ,,the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us by their songs. Moreover you asked what to wear. Do not bother. I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes, like a jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket. Donnot forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have  chance to change it. Finally I give you some advise for what you could do for about three hours. Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum, it is located near the hotel. Furthemore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located to walk within five minutes. Lastly there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows. For further information please call me up. I hope you will have an interesting conference here. I am looking forward  seeing you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The telephone a very important invention In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived. It has been in her parents' appartement. The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls. Todays nobody could imagine such a situation. In every household there is a telephone at least. There are a lot of advantages for it. Firstly people are able to talk to  person on every time. Be it: just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins. Moreover we always can call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor. This could save  life! An other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it. Of course there is also a big disadvantage. All people know this situation; people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone. Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time. Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention. To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things. It is always the same  how to people use it or not and how people handle it. ",23
772," 13 June, 2000 Dear Helen. I've been thrilled eversince I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently. In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choice that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen along with some questions. Firstly, I wish to travel on July as I already have plans for June which is to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacations commences. Secondly, to the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much. Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing. I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort. However, as this will be my first time to go surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners. Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lie to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of  amount of money I will have spend in the camp. I am looking forward in being received in camp California. Thank you in advance. Yours sincerely, Regina Kong   [SEP]  13 June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hi Kim. How are you? I am fine and so is my family. I was glad to receive your letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could. I thin it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band having their concert. At first, they asked me to decorate the stage since I like drawing, but as I wanted to get more involved, they said that I could also help them set up the lights, the microphones and the instruments. I have to admit that it wasn't always easy, but my effort was worth every penny. The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well. I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together. I'm not sure of what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too. If you have any questions, please write to me. I wish you the best of luck and hope you have fun helping the singers as much as I did Lots and lots of kisses, Regina ",37
240," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week. I feel disappointed because it was different to  the advertisement. First of all, the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there were two unknown actors in the show. I feel most disappointed about this. The show was started at 20.15 but actually it should  started at 19.30. Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned  discount is available. And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed because at that day was their day-off. But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you know it would be closed. I am afraid it was not a best musical show because all the things above was not an accurate as what we had been told. On the whole, I feel disappointed about the event and I would  have my money back. I look forward to hearing your reply. Thank you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I say this because of the experience I've had from her. Actually, we were quite good friends before the event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year. She is sitting next to me, we started to chat more and more, then we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually. Suddenly my heart was thumbing so quickly because I saw him? - A boy who is a new student. I know this is one right love, I'm absolutely besorrted of him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossip behind me then everyone would know I fancy him. But the thing which I've never expected is Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always make  joke on it, that makes me feel so embarrised: I was very angry at that time! Now, I don't talk to her anymore because I can't stand a person who I trusted betrayed me. I hope she would know that  was her fault and don't do it anymore. ",21
130," Dear Sir/Madam, Last week, I had a week's holiday in London, where I haven't been for 2 years. I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it, we were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, the last day was the worst thing we have got, which was your musical show. At first, you said that, if we had bought 5 tickets, we would have had a discount, but we didn't have anything. Secondly, we booked  the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15, what's wrong with your clock?. Thirdly, someone on stage was very strenge for me, because I expected to see ""Danny Brook"", but I didn't. The last one, we wanted to have a dinner in your restaurant after a terrible musical show, but we couldn't have it, because a waiter said your chef had gone home. I have no idea what your business is, I have never seen something like this. By the way, I want you to pay  my money back for the waste time, and I think that you understand. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Have you ever been in the Countryside? Try it, it doesn't need to take a long time to live in that place, but it will give you many things, which are different from your lifestyle in  city. Nowadays you wake up in a morning, go to school or work by the sky-train, start your lessons with the computer, go for shopping in a store which has an air-conditioner, watch cartoons on TV, or cook by a microwave oven etc. Do you really enjoy it? Althoug the modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it gives you natural, peace and fresh air? How much the technology gives to you, it take from you more. Have you heard about the environment pollutions, the healthy problems and the moral problems? These all happen from human who want to live with science and technology, not the natural which the world gives it to us.  ",26
1161," Dear Mrs Maria Smith: I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for. the group has been booked into the Harris hotel. this hotel is very good placed. From there you can get a taxi, catch the  buses seven and eleven, wich both have you very close to the conference place, and also you can go by underground to get there. the conference starts at 5:30 pm and it finishes at 8:00PM. Then, after the Conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, wich starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM. this party is a formal one, so you should  be casual dressed. In this area you could visit the central park. It is very beautiful and a very good place to relax. Another place that would be interesting to visit is the old cathedral of the city. I hope these information could be useful for you. Yours Sincerelly  [SEP]  Hampton Court Palace Introduction: I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit. I went to Hampton Court last year, and I think it is a great place to visit. Location: Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court. In addition to that, I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty. transport: to get to Hampton Court palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo train station. From there depart the trains to Hampton Court. Moreover, I think  by train is the best way to get there, because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace. Price: there is a great price for children, students, adults and families. They are between three and six pounds each. Conclusion: Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see. And also it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it. ",24
785," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Thank you very much for your letter. I am so glad to know I won the first prize. Regarding your questions, the following are my answers. The only time available for me to travel is July, any time during the month suits me. I need to insist in it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year. I will love to be in a log cabin. They are more comfortable and really match with the enveiroment. It is not easy to chose from the list of activities, all of them look interesting. Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and Photographe. The first one sounds like a great adventure, while the second will allow me to capture all the unforgettable views. In addition, I would appreciate  if you let me know what is the kind of clothing required for the Camp; if I need some money there and for what; and finally if the prize is just for me or if I can go with somebody else. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Finally I'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life. Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears's Concert? During the day I helped preparing her room, then she arrived, and I was there to continue helping. She was so kind with all of us, of course I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon, I can't wait to show it . The concert was a big success,  lot of excitment. Everybody sang and danced, and I was there to see everything from the best position. Each time, when she comes back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her weight. Then she eat something small and she looks full of energy all night long. At the end, she took the time to say good by to all of the people helping her. I really think she's the best. But now, tell me about you. Don't be lazy and write more often. ",29
450," To the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager: Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your show ""Over the rainbow"" and the conditions in which it is held. I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show. I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor. So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available  as  stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15! No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted. To sum up, it was not the ""perfect evening out!"" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead). Looking forward to receiving your reply very soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's what I learned from my own experience. We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets for each other. At that time, I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money. I had to wait ten days before the lotery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone. But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I find out that I had many unsuspected friends... No longer after, they were asking me to pay a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go shopping, others to go to the cinema and the restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me. Endly came the end of the week and I went to the lotery office to check the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs for many people had found five numbers like me. SO I told my friend Pat how much I had won and the following day at school, everybody were just the same as they ever were with me... ",34
532," Dear Mr Brown, I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I got rather disappointed. First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. What is quite not true because when I asked for it, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding ""no"". When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently from what the advertisement sign says, what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play. But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance  the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing from the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stamped on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"". So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and  given the reasons, I expect   to count with your sense of responsability, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds  spent on that terrible night. yours faithful,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? As we all know, technology had a gigantic improvement over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways. First of all, we all became much more sedentary than in the past. Most of the modern jobs involves computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and  Internet, a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk. Also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, what brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continous replacement of men by machines, the unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who lives in third world country. So, men have invented machines to help him on his tasks, but nowadays, we our becoming slaves of them. The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers since an early age, so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future.

1067," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to you about the trip to London. All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have set, they are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year. So we can walk around and see how it looks like in Greenwich. All of us want to go to this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we all would like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m., it is about the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, all of us are really interesting, and it is free for student to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things in there. So may you please change the visit of the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was two years ago, me and my classmates went to a leadership trip in London. This trip was organised by our form tutor, he wanted to test us if we trust each other and worked in a team, and the trip last for 3 days. The first days was going fine, we just had to do some teamwork things. In the second day, we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and careful, and I climbed about 15 metres quite success, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right feet slipped over, I was nearly fell down, but luckly my hand caught a rock, it was dangerous, but I didn't had any choice, finally I did it. ",31
363," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, the actors who starring was not Dany Brook as it was advertised but one other actor, whose performance was very bad. That made the show disappointing. Secondly, the show should began at half past seven. despite these fact the show began at a quarter to eight. Also, there was not available tickets  and after these bad musical show the restaurant of the theatre was closed. My evening was not very pleasant as you advertised. As a result of that I demand to have some of my money back. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  If I say that technology has not changed my life I would be lying. If fact technology change in a major point my life. Can you imagine your life without a car or a television? I don't. Technology  so much  my life which I could not live without it. But technology doesn't only makes my life better. By the use of  car I do not only get an easy way to move , but I  destroy my enviroment. Also, if I use the car, in small distances when I can go on foot, I destroy my physical situation. Could you imagine your life without a television or a computer? I could not. Althouth with the computer I can contact with my friends and with the television I relax, I could not find another way to relax and contact with others. Technology is very important for my life. It makes my life more easier, and it would be much more difficult to live without it ",22
140," Dear sir, I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday. In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see. First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the brochure. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed. I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even if I had read on the brochure that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed. Thanks to you, I've had the most dreadful experience of my life. If you don't give me back my money I'll never go to your theatre again. Write back soon  [SEP]  As Modern technology is changing the world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it's causing. New technologies have affected people's way of living for ages, by offering them better tools  to survive I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about  Internet. I think that  Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard  Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net. I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I'm really astounded by its way  of changing my daily life. ",34
521," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your music show entitled ""Over the Rainbow"" Which I saw during my holiday in London. Firstly, I expected to see the play by Danny Brook who is my favourite actor. However, without any announcement, a different actor was playing his role. Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show would have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed because of the equipment mentenance. You should have let us know such information in advance. Finally, although I heard the student discount ticket was available, the ticket salesman said I should have bought it at least one day before the show. I was not satisfied with your show at all. Therefore, I think you should pay some money back for me. Please let me know how you think of my complain and request as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Thank you for modern technology. I think modern technology has changed my daily life, especially in communication with my best friend who is studying in Britain. We had seen each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain. I used to think I would miss her. But now I can communicate with her every day by e-mail. Furthermore, we can talk on the phone. I feel no distance as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan. Without a computer and a telephone, I couldn't contact her easily and I may lose touch with her. in addittion, I could go tot Britain to see her by plane. Before the plane was invested, I suppose it might take several months to visit Britain by ship. In present, it takes just 12 hours by plane. Thanks to such modern technology, I can improve the relationship with my friend, even if she is living  away from me. ",27

I like to sleep in a tent under the free sky since I have done the military-service therfore I would prefer a tent as my accomodation. My favourite activity are swimming and singing.

Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable What does  means the world ""shopping""? I live and I need different goods for survive. I need material for drinking and eating, that is the basic fact that  I must go shopping for food. It is not enjoyable to see that the prize for food are going more and more higher. My salary are going lower than lower. When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of goods whitout take care on my money. Despite I have enough money shopping is not always enjoyable too, because I don't know which goods I will buy in the future. Also I will buy goods which I don't need. There are many goods which quality is bad  in this way the environment pollution will be more and more increase. This is the fact that shopping is not enjoyable. ",22
1192," Dear Mrs Smith. I have just received your letter. It was very sorry news to Richard Brown. I have given much information of the international student conference. Firstly, the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus. Number 45 bus runs to there every 5 minutes. It takes 25 minutes that is convenient to us. Secondly, there are some  programme that are very great. First time, the conference's head make a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks. Finally we enjoy a disco party so you  wear a suiteable dress. On the last day I  go to your house and then we think about our's conference plane. I hope it will be a successful conference. See you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Alice knew that it was going to be a very special day for her. Alice and Jane came back her home. Alice is Jane's boy friend. In the morning they have met and then they went to  beach. It was nice weather and   beautiful time. In the evening they were going to the disco party that was Jane's friend's birthday party. Jane suddenly thought about her house key that  left inside her house and Alice could see the her house and he found the bathroom window was opening. So he crimbed on the radder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there ""what happened?"" Jane expained that situations and they under stood him. So they could go to the disco party. It was a very wonderful party and they have never forgot that day. It was a very very special day. ",14
709," Hellow! I'am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because this month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it. So your advice of going to a camp suits me very well. Answering on our first question about where would I prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because it is closer to nature and I like sleepping in sleepping bags (=BV bags). Now let me tell you about my sports preferances. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us went out from  water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am candidat to masters of sports in water polo. And only out of that reason, but also because I like water very much. Also I would like to have a t-shirt with your signature. Yours scinerly Fedor Gapon.  [SEP]  In our lyceum we have  listem of ""double lessons"". It means that every day exept Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for  hour and a half and it means  ""double lesson"". I think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty five minutes. It is convinient, I mean ""double"" lessons because you have more time to understand  matherial what is givven  and because you have to prepare only four subjects for ""tomorrow"" and it is less then seven subjects. As a student of  economical form I think I should tell you about one day in  time table of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have such lessons English, Math, Economics and Phisics. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them. Especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists. Not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, Biology and Phisical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.

633," Dear Ms, I have just received your letter which inform me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA. In this letter you ask me  some further information for my conveniance for this trip. Firstly, I can take my holiday only  the two first week of july because of my work. Secondly, I would prefer sleep in a tent. I am going every year camping in the countryside of France. The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing. I have never sailed but I am a well swimmer. Last summer I took a course of one week in Switzerland of climbing so I have good knowledge of this sport. Finally could you please tell me wich kind of clothes shall I take with me and if the camping furnitures are provided. I  also wondering me how much money I need and if there is a safe place where I can put my money and passport. I look forward to earing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful. Yours sincerely Laura Demoriane  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on saturday because for lots of people they don't go to work  and  is the only day off of the majority of people. If you don't get up enough early you can't find a parking  in the town centre, all of them are full before 11 am. In the street is so crowded that you can't walk like usually and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lost them. In the shops is worth, if you are lucky and you find a clothes with your right size you will wait 20 min. at the fitting room and after that 20 min more at the cash desk. In the supermarket  is the same. When you buy food or drink they give you  plastic bag for carry it  and this bags broke every time. At the end of the month when your husband will receive the bill from you visa card he will have an heart-attack! Why not buy with  internet or if you have a nice mother at home enjoy this time because shopping is like go in the jungle. ",24
390," Dear Sir, I am writting in order to complain about the musical show  which name is Over the Rainbow that I could see in your theatre recently. I like very much this musical and while I was spending some days in London I could see you advertisement so I decided to go to see it. First of all I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement. It was a pitty but it did not annoye me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 . So I entered to the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight (three quarters  delayed). Then I got nervous and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained  us the reasons  . Finally, when the musical started I realized that Danny Brook, my favourite actor, was not there. In your advertisement his name was in main letters and in the musical the actor was different. After the show I decided to go to drink a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete to try calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the free day for the barman. I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you return my money and take notes of all these problems. If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? A long time ago technology wasn't an important element for people because they didn't appreciate it. Change weren't a normal situation and Governments didn't invest enough money on it. Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day. For instance, modern technology is changing the way I work. My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things on that I wasted a lot of time before. Not only are the computers useful for keep information but also computers can give you a lot of information due to  Internet. On the other hand, I realized that modern technology not is as good as people think: I hate mobiles. I know that some people need them to work but I can't understand why teenagers need it. To sum up, modern technology is changing my work, my life, and my friends. Maybe it would be a nice idea to analize these changes and to put limits to technology, because I think that the most important  is  our life and no the ways we  improve it. ",28
838," I am writing to thank  for the letter with the result of the competition and also to ask some questions. Firstly, I would like to inform  that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month. The reason for it, is that, July is the only month in which, I am on holidays so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer stay in  tents rather than stay in  log cabins because I appreciate having straight contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and  climbing I used to climb trees, walls everything in my childhood without falling. Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money would  be adviseable to take and what kind of clothe I should take. I look forward  an answer from you. Yours Faithfully Adriana  [SEP]  I am just writing to tell you about my experience about helping at a pop concert. Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have the unique opportunity to take  pictures  with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay  your ticket it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were not disadvantages. Kim, summing up it was the most interesting experience that I have ever had. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Lots of Love XXXXX Adriana ",34
759," Dears Ms. Helen Ryan, I was really greatful when I recieved your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July. Because my school finishes   end of June and I will have a month break  after that I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for it. Could you possibly tell me, at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins. Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents. I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis. Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them. Maybe I will have time to do enough practise as much as I always wanted to do. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I would need to bring with me and will I need any extra money for this holiday. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I don't know where to start but I can say it was the greatest time I have ever had. As I mentioned  you before  Friend of mine, she is a stage assistant and she needed a help for that pop concert last month. I told her if she need help I would be happy to help her. Next day when I went there I have met lots of people   very famous and very friendly. It took us almost a month to prepare for this concert. You wouldn't believe how hard it was. the stage was covered with all sort of light and we made it look like a waterfall. The waterfall made by real rock so that was the worst bit because they were really heavy and we had to carry them, but  the end of  moth when the concert started, it was all over. I sung and dance all day. I have lots of memory which I could never forget. I wish you were there. I hope you shared my happiness with me. Lots of love, ",25
1210," Dear Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter and I will try to help you. I will remind you that the international student conference will be the next month on the first of July. The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch the bus number 37 which will go to  town center. From there you will walk until the college because it is easier to get there  than to get with another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from  town center. After the conference some drink and food will be available in the sport-center which is well equipped for disco-party. Our party has a special subject 'Western'. So we suggest to wear western clothes. On your last day you could go to the sport-musseum which is grateful and famous around the world or only go for a walk around Reconvillier-Park. I hope that I had answer all of your question and that the conference will be grateful. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  From: To: the group leader Subject: old Roman School. Introduction: I am writing to explain you about the location, the architecture and  the story of the old Roman school from Courtelary. I hope that you will get there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful thing to see. It is the unique old Roman school in the world. Location: Courtelary is situated in Switzerland and the school is on the top of the town's hill. This place is very important because it is there that an Emperor had growing up. Architecture: It is a typical  from this epoque with beautiful draw on the wall and first kind of writing in the sport center. The door is enormous because for them the entry was the most important. History: All began when Ogus Micius said that Roman need to go at school. They decided to build more school specially in Switzerland because the people  were considerated clever. During the Second World War all  school were demolished  only our is left. Conclusion: I gave you a lot of reason to get in this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town. ",25
1031," Dear Mr. Robertson, I was asked by my class to write to you. First of all, we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three days trip to London. Indeed, we are especially interested in the sightseeing  by bus. The river trip to Greenwich is also a marvellous idea! Moreover, we couldn't go there without visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. However, could we make a suggestion? Having seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th, we would particularly like to go and visit it. How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for it! Besides, as there are more girls than boys in the class, they would certainly enjoy attending on live make-up and hairstyles. Lastly, it is free for students, which is fantastic! So, instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, we might go to the Show. We may go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, as we should have had  freetime. What do you think of this suggestion? We are looking forward to receiving your reply. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  For famous people, having a private life is difficult, especially because we are all interested in their lives. On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television. On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what we often forget they are.  ",40

443," 17 June 2000. Dear Sir and Madam I am recently spending a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain with  couple of things. First, I  like to complain about the main features which is an actor, he might have been well known in England, but on the night, he performed abysmally. Secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time, because all of us at least have to wait for almost an hour until the show start. Also, a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement. For example, the discount for the tickets were not available, and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party. Lastly, I think I could not call this as my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as a Manager of London's newest theatre, you would handle the situation favourbly. Yours faithfully. Seung Phittikhun.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, although he's one of my best friend, but sometimes, he's a real pain in a butt. Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I always got on very well. We always go to the same school, and he's often make more friends than I do, and everytime he's always introduce them to me. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secreats for anyone, even himself. Although, we are great friends, but sometimes people can make such a stupid mistake, and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight, it all started when once I accidently, took the wrong bag back to my house, and there was lady's knickers inside, I was so nervous and embarassing, so I tell Pat and there he goes, he tell every single students in the school that I've stolen  girl knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert. So that's when we had a fight. Anyway Pat eventually apologized to me and we still being best mates as ever. ",30
678," Dear Helen: I've recived your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax myself and to leave the city, which is very extressing. I only can travel on July because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the mounth he can give me , so I hope it isn't a problem for you. To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in  tents, that's in my opinion a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals, although I don't mind living in log cabins. In spite of liking all the sports you wrote  in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing, because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child. I have got a doubt, it is not very important, but I would like to know if I need any money or  all is payed , the kind of clothes I should wear, if the weather is good or bad... and all the extra information you can send me. Thank you very much for the prize. Yours faithfully. Eliza Vasquez.  [SEP]  Why  people like so much go shopping? In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family, so for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money. Othrewise, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy hardly ever, only when they need clothes or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as  funny as you want, although if you do it very often, it will be as an obligation in the future. To sum up, all you make in small cuantities is good and funny, but don't encrease them if you don't want to feel uncomfortable. ",28
1003," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter, so I write  you to give you some informations from me. I would like to travel on July because I finish school on June and I go to Great Britain on August for one month. If I can choose my accomodation, I prefer living in  tent. I prefer this accomodation because I think it's more easy to met people when you live in  tent, near them, than when you live in  log cabin. I want playing tennis and  swimming. I didn't play tennis before, so I am not good. I go to  swimming-pool two time by week, so I am good at this sport. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I will have to wear to play tennis? Could you tell me if I will need money for paid my dinners? Yours sincerely. Eric Durand  [SEP]  There is a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to chose some of them. I think the best choice is to show many types of activities. We could show  team spirit of our school with sport activities like soccer, basketball or handball. We could also show cultural activities: there is a lot of clubs of music or painting  in our school. I think it could be interested to show how students work to write the new paper of school. At the end, we can also show where we can be relaxed. We should filmed our pub and  room of students. All this activities which should be filmed, are  our daily life at our school. ",21
1104," Dear Sir, I am writing  you to know about some comments and suggestions from some students about the trip you have already organized to London. First of all, we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show which takes place from Monday 13th to Wednesday 15th. It is opened from 10:00 to 19:00 and it is for free for students. This is a great opportunity because we can know more about leisure and fashion from this city. If you allow us to go we could change the programme in this  way. Firstly, on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing by bus. Secondly, on Tuesday morning we can watch the Leisure  and Sports wear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally, on Wednesday, we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and makes up spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery. We hope you consider our suggestions  letting us know your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The home of the Future If you think in the future you could think in faster and better machines, advanced technology or  better life. All this will happen in the next 50 years, how can we be prepared to receive all these things in our homes? The next 50 years. Nowadays, our home life allow us to have more free time to spend doing leisure activities like practising sports or going out. In the close future we will be able to do nothing because everything will be done by computers and machines, ( washing-up, hovering, ironing, gardening, cooking, etc. ) The question is, will it be  better life? On the one hand, we will be able to spend more time with our family and not to be worried about anything. No more housework, no more stress, nor more illnesses; everything will be perfect. On the other hand, life will be boring, a large amount of workers will be have redundant and housewives will not have anything to do which will be extremely boring and tedious. What do you prefer? Do you enjoy doing nothing or do you really enjoy what you do? It is your desicion. ",26
460," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Having seen with two of my friends your musical show last week-end at The Circle Theatre which  called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", I am writing to complain about our disappointing evening. First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'tickets student price'. Despite being forced to buy adult tickets, we still were excited and took our seat, and waited for the beginning of the show. Usually, the show starts at 19:30, but this time we had to wait until 20:15! In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement , so we were disappointed. Concerning the restaurant, it was closed due to transformations. In the result, I am sure you will understand our annoyed and frustrated, so it was not a perfect evening out that your advertisement stated  was. Finally, I am writing to request a full-refund for my friends and I, because I felt your advertisement was misleading. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, H. Boulard  [SEP]  What do you think about what will clothes be like in the future? I'm sure that anyone has already thought about it, because fashionable clothes have always been really important for almost all of us. Let's have a look at different points. From the past until now, we have  wearing several different  fashionable clothes, but why? From my point of view, almost all humans would like to be more and more attractive, so we always think about it. As a result, clothes are the easiest way to be more attractive. In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever. Furthermore, it's one of the best way to make money. Anyway, don't you think that nowadays, fashionable clothes is quite similar than  20 years ago? It's evident that whatever we wear look like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid. We can't wearing peculiar clothes like in science fiction films. I bet you that in 100 years, humans will  wearing exactly the same clothes as today, because we love the actually fashion of clothes which is wonderful. The last survey about fashion shown that people feel really comfortable with those now! ",28
940," Dear Helen Ryan: My name is Julia Sanches and I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writing to tell you the information you have asked  about me: I would like to travel on July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes. About the activities, I would like to do Basketball and Surfing. I play Basketball at school twice a week and I enjoy it. Although I do not play perfectly, I play quite well, but I would still like to practice. I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice oportunity to practice surfing too. There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe (and quantity) of Clothes I will have to take,  if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff (like raincoates). Well, that would be all. I look forward to receiving your letter. Yours sincerely, Julia Sanches  [SEP]  IS EVIL INTERESTING? Since we are kids people tell us stories with two sides in conflit: the good and the bad side. The good always wins, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting? On the tale ""It's a good life"", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and uningative. He controls the other people using the power of his mind. Although the other people on the story are the good ones and suffer with his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told  us by the author. In conclusion, even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad, sometimes the good ones are quite boring, and we find the bad one much more interesting. ",29
602," 1th, June, 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter and I am so glad to win the prize. Thank you very much! In answer  your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have begun painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will I get any tuition? Finally, I should like to ask some questions. How is the weather like in California in July? What kind of clothes should I pack? If I want to buy some gifts, how much money should I take and can I use traveller's cheques in every place? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our lives are getting better and better, so people began to go shopping more frequently. It's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us  good apart from the temporary satisfaction? Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In  fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under  these tricks. The result,  we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty. Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they? Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out it won't be always enjoyable.  ",37
1233," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, as the leader of the conference-organisation, I'm glad if I can help you. My wish is that nothing goes wrong. So you have to know more details about our conference. Your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is placed in the city centre. As far as I know this hotel is very comfortable. There is also a subway-station near Palace Hotel. Our college is not much far away. You only have to take the subway-train. After three stations you have arrived  Brooklyn street. When you come out of the subway you see our college. The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock. The students have prepared a music program for the end-of-conference party. There will also be an international buffet. So don't eat too much before you come. And please don't worry about clothes. There are not any rules. In our city there is a big adventure swimming park. I think you should visit Water World on your last day. You will have a lot of fund, I can tell you. If you need any further information please call me. My number is: 793354 Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The telephone is a very important invention, which has affected our lives. It is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places. People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life. In my opinion people need a telephone. For example a telephone is very important in job-life. Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone. Also it is god for people's safety. You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured. The people use the telephone also for their personal life. For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away. Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone. They are able to give and receive informations very quickly. This invention has made our lives easier and quickier. The telephone has made my own life also easy and quick. It makes something possible you can not do. Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people. ",29
884," Dear Sir/Madam. Firstly, I would like to say that I am surprise to received the letter from you. I read the information as you gave to me, it is very interesting. It is very good due. According to Camp California in the U.S.A. I expect to traveling on July because I will have a long holiday break on that time and my children have to go to France with student's school on July as well. I think, it will be  very good time to traveling by without worries. How is about an accommodation. I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural. Can you imagine how exsiting  when we stay in the dark and very quite and we can hear a sound of  animal. How's amazing that? When I arrived there, I would  to  painting and take a photography  because both of its was my hobby. I have been doing a lot of them when I have got a free time and when I feel empressted  where I have been. I think I can do it very well. Fainally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how is the weather over there on July because I will prepare the clothes as usedful. By the way I have to say thank you very much for everything that you was offer me and I look forward  the further information from you. your sincerely ZITA ZALAI  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? It was  very long time as I didn't write the letter to you. I hope, you will feel better when you finished my letter. Today I  going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert as I went from last month, it has got a lot of thing to talk about. Firstly it is about the hall which they used for  concert. It is  very big hall including the sound system and the light at the steat. It was brillian. Secondly it is the super star as they came to show at  concert. They are very cool. By the way I had done many thing in that concert. I had to connect with people who  responsible about  ticket. They had to check when people came in the hall and I was the one who checking the tickets as well. You know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't weait to go at  frount and they are try to go over very quickly. So you have to explaining too many time to make people clamed down and standed in the row. It was very hard for me and I won't do it again. In the further more if you want to go there. miss you, ",19
128," Dear Mr James, My name is Paula and I'm one of your latest visitors of your show ""Over the Rainbow'', this is also the reason of my letter. Last week during my holiday in London, I found your advertisment in my newspaper. This looked very good to me, one of my favourite actors, the time did suit me and  for the tickets was a discount available. Everything was just perfect. But, suddenly the whole evening changed into something, we didn't expected at all. The first disappointment confronted us on the main entrance, there was no discount for our ticket available. Despite of this we have still been looking forward to the show and Danny Brook. Your state in your advertisment that he would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up. Actually, this guy was not half as good as Danny Brook. The other thing was the time, the show was supposed to start at half past seven, but we have been waiting for 45 minutes, before the light turned off. Till then we have been very upset about the evening and decided to go for dinner. Eventually, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I really do regret that I told Pat about my feelings for the new girl in class, but who else can I talk to, if it is not your best friend?. Her name is Carla and she just changed school, she is so beautiful, with long legs, blond hair and a voice which makes me melt. I've never been so fascinated by a girl and so I knew it must have been real love. Luckely I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then, it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to. Pat, he was my friend, and he knew girls. I thought he would keep everything like a thing between him and me, but he disappointed me. He actually went to Carla and told her every thing. No doubt she would never ever look at me again. But she did, she asked me out. The horrible thing about this is, I'm still in heaven, but  out with the wrong person, because Pat mixed the persons with their names. There are two Carlas in my class! ",23
745," Dear Sir/Madam. I've just recived your leter, and I must say that I am so surprised, I wasn't expecting to win it. I  still studing at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the begining of July. About the acomodation, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest. I've got some problem to sleep and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a ten. You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot wich are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choise, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather trained in climbing, I have done it once a mounth since I was 17. But in the other hand, I have never done surfing, I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to do it. I've got just one question to do, I know it is all include, but is there anything I will have to pay for? If there is, please let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon, and please let me know if you need any further information. Yours Faithfully:  [SEP]  First of all, I think we should have a protagonist for it. A good idea to start will be a clock alarm ringing close to his bed, because that's the way everyone get up in the morning, (unless the people who don't do anythink) After that, we should have a morning view of one of the most busiest London tube station in order to show stressed people going in and out, Including our protagonist going out peacefully with a couple of books on his hand - then the school's door, and him going in. After all this introduction,  will be the time to show some of the acitivities every one can join in the school, such as lesons or others like the library, our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar, the reception service.. And finally a view of all the students leaving the school would be a nice end. ",16
714," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter with reference to the competition. Here are the information you required. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I am free. Secondly, I prefer cabins. The main reason is that I love wood. In addition, due to my height (185 cm), I think cabins may be a better choice. Thirdly, from the activity list, I chose swimming and tennis as my favourite ones. Although I have played tennis only twice, I really enjoyed it. With contrast to this , I can swim when I was six. Furthermore, I once have been trained in a swimming centre, so I am quite confident with it. Lastly, could you please tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should prepare and do I have to buy insurance myself? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video from my school. In my opinion, maths, politics, chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English  and other foreigners are particularlly curious in. As far as I know, English people are really surprised about  Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as the knowledge in politics. This is a good oppertunate to see how they learn in class. As it is expected, painting lesson is an amazing one. You can find students use traditional chinese ink to draw and write. In spite of lessons, there are all kind of activities such as sports meeting, racing competition, and countryside activities. Some are held once a year and some are held every term. You will experience a different life in them. In conclusion, besides all  mentioned, I highly recommond you video  students' daily life and interview them. That will make it defenitely a successful video. ",26
955," Dear Helen I have just received the letter with the result of your competition. I feel really enthusiastic about spending a couple of weeks at Camp California. Unfortunately, as I will be on traineeship in August, I hope this could occur in July. Besides I would prefer staying in a tent. It provides me a feeling of adventure which is very exciting. I'm also very glad to see such a variety of activities  at the camp. It's quite difficult to say wether I prefer painting or sailing. All in all I have never practised Golf nor surfing, so let's try it! Eventually, I would like to know where the camp is located. Will I have the opportunity to visit San Franscico or Los Angles? I would love it! Moreover, how much money will I need if I want to go out at night? These are some further details I keep wondering about. I'm looking for your answer. Yours Sincerely Ignace Cloutier.  [SEP]  Daily life at school: What should be filmed. First of all, I would like to lay the emphasis on the fact that this report can be seen by the director of the school. Therefore it must be objective. Then it may improve our day life at school. It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at the final examination. Then I would like to film the computer rooms. Sometimes there is so much people that you have to wait half an hour to get one computer. If only we could get some new ones. Eventually, it would be nice to make a sequence with lots of sports activities. It would bring some rhythm to the video. Moreover it will show of  healthy the students are. These are some ideas we could discuss over. ",38
1128," Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I'm writing to thank you  the great opportunity you give us, especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way. I think that this programme has a good organisation, as you know, due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points. But, I was wondering, like a student of this college, if we would change part of this programme ... we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock. In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the, we can go to the show. Front my point of view, we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear, make up, hairstyles, you know ... I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and   best city to appreciate it. Please let me know if you are agree with us! Oh I forgot about it! Besides, this show is gree (another positiu point). Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE? Do you think you've  the future in your hands? Do you think we're living like  old times? Would you like living in a modern way? What do you expect about the future? Can you compare it ...? Are you afraid? Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes,  to cook to be more comfortable, for example the TV, the video recorder, etc. Maybe, in a few years later we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, from my point of view, I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes. We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer's games for example... But not in the strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars by aereoplanes... In this way, you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing  in the same way you'r changing, too. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening  our lifes. So, we have the future in our hands! Think about it. ",24
1204," Dear Mrs Smith, First of all I'm sorry to hear that Richard Brown is ill. As you are the leader of a group instead of him, I'm delighted to give  all the information you have asked for. The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and from there to the conference, we have organized with the hotel's bus service to take the student to the conference. We will meet at the lobby at 9.00 AM. The conference party will last at 1.00 AM, but every body do not need to stay until the end. There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end. The bus will be service at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM then at the end of the party  will be the last one. Everybody are free to dress for the party but be considering  to be appropriate. On the last day at noon, you could go to the craft centre near by the Airport. There are lots of thing there you will enjoy watching or buying for friends. If there is any information you need to know about the conference, please let me know. I look forward to see you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Telephone saved my friendship It's very hard to decide which invention is the best. Because all of them are so important in difference way. As now I'm being away from home,  telephone is very important to me. Having  telephone I can call my mother, my friends which helping me from  home sick, not completely but I think it's better than other ways. To hear the voice from the person you love is the feelling that  hard to describe, it's wonderful and so real, you can imagine their face clearly. I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e-mail. The problem is the language, we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us misunderstand each other. However, the problem solved by a telephone. We are now still friend. Thanks to the invention of the telephone. ",20
596," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter. I'm pleased to that I've won the first prize at camp california in the U.S.A during two weeks. First of all, I would like travel on July because I am going to finish the college at the end of June and I will work  the first of august. Second of all, About the accomodation, I would prefer a log cabin, I think that will be more safety about all my stuff. I'm very keen to have the chance to do some activities, I'm very attracted by the golf. I will be a beginner because I've never done this sport before but I will have a try. Also, I choose surfing, I love this sport. I've been practicing this sport since 5 years, so I'm quiet good. Finally I would like to know if I need a lot of money about this excursion and if we are going to visit some building. I've know idea what kind of weather it is in  USA could you let me know what type of clothes should I bring with me. yours Sincerly  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your last letter, I'm really envy you  holiday under the sun. Last month was amazing for me, I was helping at a pop concert. All right, I wasn't able to do all the stuff like the lights the stereo, the sound but I've been helping to built the stage and the installation of micros. The stage was gigantesque the crowed could be all around. I really enjoyed to be next to the pop stars I got a lot of autographes, that was the first time I've seen  like Jagger a lot of well know pop stars was there. I mean It's still inbelivable, can you imagine that was  like a dream I was  checking their hands. I keep a very good souvenir about this experience. I think I will go back the next year. Do you want join me? I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Love ",26
507," 17/06/2000 Mr Smith, I write  you because last friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre. I went there because I had read a banner about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", but many informations were wrong. Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act. But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the show of 2.30 p.m., we couldn't enter in the theatre because the discounts weren't available. So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show! No only : we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded by another actor! I ask you if is it possible to have my money back, please, because I want to forgot that expense. Thank you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology can't not transforme our daily life. The inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and after  few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band, then I can go back home when I want, listening  the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car. So I have must more interestings things to do in my life. But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer. In everytime of the day I can communicate with people of all nationality of the world, I can have informations about everything, I can buy something which I can't find in the shops of my town, so I can do anything just  clicking on the mouse! Sadly, there is also a negative aspect. Sometimes,  computer substitudes real relationships between people. In fact, many boys pass several hours in front of their computer and the forgive that out of their houses there are their friends.... In conclusion, I think that modern technology get my life more interesting, but I prefer to stay with my friends and with my girlfriend then in front of a computer! ",22
1045," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to say thank you to you Mr Robertson for planning to take us to spend three days in London. Your programme looks very interesting, especially the River Trip to Greenwich, which I always dreamt of. However, we have seen an advertisement on the English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00. The show will have  latest fashions from  top fashion designers in the world. Leisure show will have leisure and sports wear, new make up style and new hair style for next year. The best thing is that it is free because we are students. We would like to ask you whether we can change some  programme. Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show. We won't miss any programme that you have planned and we could also have  great opportunity to see the show. We're looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time"". In my opinion, everybody wants to have a happy life in our own world, we want to do whatever we want, sometimes we do the right things and sometimes we do the wrong things. We are ordinary people, we work and come home to have activities with our family or go out together. The politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. Although, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of  public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their story always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story base on the true story just to get  attraction from people. I think, if the journalist want to publish the politicians and film stars private life, they should have asked for permission. They deserve to have a private life as everybody .  ",28
888," Thank you for that information. I don't expected that I can win in your's competition. I like to travel only  July becouse now I'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I don't have a time for enything else. When I will arrive. I would prefer accommodation in Log cabins. I prefer that becouse I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation. I tell you in sicryt that, I don't know whay she do that. You said that I will have the chance to do two activities, sou I choose swimming and sailing. I Love all kind of water sports. In summer I always goes to  seaside or some kind of lake to swim. I like to catch fisch too. I think that I'm good at swimming. When I was young I had been swimm in many competition. My live record is 27.66 for fivety meters. I would like to ask you about  weather at California's  Julay. What kind of clothes I should bring with me. Are there any discoteks or something I would like to know if my wife can come with me, becouse withou't she I can't be there.  [SEP]  Daily life at my school I'm studying at National Academy of Defense. There is about two thousands students at my school. There are only men. Everybody gets up at six, and  first things they do it is run for about two thousends five houndred meters. Then they take a schower and everybody goes for breakfast. Usually I have eight lessons. Two times a week I have W-F. This is very important, becouse every soldier schould be strong. Today there was the sport competition in Basketball. My group of students won that competition for  second time. I'm not playing basketball well, but my friends do. After this competition there was a mathematic, and two houers of biology. I don't like biology, sow I sleept on the desk in a class-room. I think that competitions should be filmed becouse my school is a kind of sport's school. On video there schould be howe we get's up. Houe we run, houe we eat breakfast. Then you should schow houe ouer school looks from outside. There schould be an intereview witch students and with profesons. Daily life at my school that is not only school and teachers and mathematicas problems. There is a military problems too. We spends a lot of time outside the school during the military things. We must knou haue to use a gun, or have to drive a tank. That kind of thinks should be filmed somehow. ",21
956,"  Mrs Ryan When I received your letter, I was very surprised and happy because I don't remember that I did this competition. First I can travel only in July because, I will finish school at the end of June and I will pass my exam in Septemeber; so I have to repeat  it a lot during the month of August. To answer your second question, I choose the accomodation in  tents because I like to sleep outside. For the activities, I choose the Golf and the Surfing (that wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, cause almost  choice interested me) I tried the golf twice, I'm really bad but I hope to do much progress . I never did surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic. I have just two questions. Can I wash any clothes there? How many money will I have to take with me? Please phone me to answer my two questions. Thanks for all Mar  [SEP]  Hello Kim I'm sorry I can only write now because last week I have too much work. As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert of last month. With my friend Miko we looked for a little job during a week-end and one evening we met a guy who wanted to buy some drinks in the pop concert and so we told him that we were agree to help him at the bar. It was a wonderful week-end: we were opposite to the singers and we have seen every concert without buying any tickets entry! (we were include in the staff of the concert) At the end we have 1200. - of benefice and each  us take 400. - for himself I particulary like seeing all this people, and I meet a lot of new friend there. For next year we search for a new barwoman. Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001. Love Mar ",22
1127," Dear Mr Robertson, I am Margherita X from the class 3C, which is going to spend three days in London. We had the opportunity to read your programme and we are happy because it is very good organized. We especially like  the National Art gallery. Thank you. With this letter I would  ask you if you wuld change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The Show is  Tuesday, March 14th from 10.00-19.00 in the Central Exibition Hall. They  gona show a latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and new hairstyles. We all think that it would be a good opportunity to see this show. We are young and we all are interested in fashion. For the students it is free. We thought that we could change the programme this way: we could go to the Science Museum  Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. I really hope that you  gona consider our request. Yours sincierly,  [SEP]  My dear brother It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a normal Saturday morning. My mam was cooking and my dad was sitting in his chair reading a book. I knew that my brother was at home, althoug I didn't know where . I was doing my homeworks when I heard an explosion. I came out of my room and I saw my brother n fire. He was playing with fire and alcohol in the bathroom. My first reaction was to put him on the floor so that the fire could stop. He was screaming because he had  such a big pain. We were shocked, we all didn't know what to do. I called a taxi because my father wasn't able to drive. We went to the hospital and they cured him. He had to stay there for three long weeks. Since that bad experience he never playied with fire again. I really like my brother and I would do anything possible to save him. ",29
239," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the show which I saw last Friday at your theatre. The show was called 'Over the rainbow' I was not pleased with the way that  was set out. First of all, when I went and bought my ticket, there was no discount but in your advertisement it said clearly that discounts are available and as a result my ticket  was bought  more expensive. Secondly, the show I went  was the evening one, which was supposed to start at 7:30 p.m. but it had a 41 minutes delay and  ended up starting at 8.15 p.m. Furthermore, the original actor was Danny Brook but it changed to a different actor which acted terribly and was very disappointing. Last of all, it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant  after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was redecorating and no annocement was made. I didn't have a perfect evening out and instead I had a awful evening out. Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like a apolygists. Thank you from you Your Sincelery,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think modles will wear in  cat walks? Will they wear anything? Who know? Nowaday, people look at fashion-magesins or get opinions from their friends  to decide what to wear in different occasions Will they still do the same 100 years later? In my opinion, I think clothes will be a lot differente  100 years later compare to now. As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves which leads to changes in fashion but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America. and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material. If you walk out  to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans which is incredibly surprising! From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular. As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings to show off their figure They might as well just wear clothes that are see through to give it a better effect! so if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year later, the only thing you can do is to WAIT! ",26
82," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing with reference to the international arts festival that you organise every year. I would like to express my opinion about it and give you some suggestions that may prove to be useful. First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also refers to the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time. On the other hand, I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made. Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform. Actually, they came from only six countries. What is more, some concert halls were too small. As a result, it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there. Finally, I suggest you should think about giving the audience the opportunity to see more plays and films. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kathy, I'm really happy to hear from you again. I'm sorry for not writing earlier. Unfortunately, I'm quite busy so don't worry if I happen to delay  answer to some of your letters. In your last letter you wondered what the rules of behaviour at school and at home are like in my country, so I'm going to give you some information. In Poland rules that refer to the ways of being dressed at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. We are supposed not to be late for the lessons and, of course, students mustn't smoke at school. At home young people should help their parents do some houseworks. Generally, we are supposed to treat our parents (as well as the teachers at school) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters. What I'd like to change at school is that the breaks are too short! Give my regards to your family, ",35
774," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for the letter which brought me such good news. I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to apreciate the travel I won. Secondly, I will give you with pleasure some information about myself you need to have. To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only in the end of June. As an accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been doing camping for years and enjoy it very much. As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp, I will choose singing which I am very good at and swimming which I am fond of but unfortunately, not a professional. In the end I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also the sum of money I will need... during my vacation. I wish you all the best and look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely yours, Lena Kazanova  [SEP]  A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men of the world would never believe that in my opinion, shopping is really not always enjoyable. Eternal crowds, high prices, long hours of choosing a suitable thing, that is what shopping means to me. Especially, I can't support to do shopping with my mother: it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with . When I am on my own, everything is fine: I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours to choose what I really want either for myself or someone else. Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way  to do it. Some go just to kill the time others - to look at something new, I am in the third group - previously I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need. But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day looking for my mother in a huge department-store. ",32
547," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July, because I will work in August in a web designer studio. So I am unable to go on holiday to another time. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like camping very much. I think it's more exciting to be in a tent than in a log cabin. I was very surprised that you offer such a great variety of sports and courses. I would like to do Basketball and Painting. I played Basketball at school for about two years. I am rather good in it. I also had Painting as  main subject at school for five years. I like painting very much, and I think I am good in Painting. I paint a lot in my free time. I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy-pictures. I would like to ask you, how much money will we need? Which clothes should we take with us? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  First I would like to point out, that this was a good idea to present our school in a short film. I think first of all we should film an english lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information-boards. I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson, maybe the pupils could write ""offers and orders"" or enquiries on the blackboard. Next I would film a BWPM lesson. This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations. They go together in groups, then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers. It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake. The smokers in the school yard, the buffett and the other pupils, who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework. I think then we should film an informatic-lesson. It would be funny to present the computers, which are often overcharged, or often the netserver is spinning. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text, while the computers do not work or brake down. I think that would be all for our video. In my opinion this are the most interesting things in our school. ",29
1175," Dear Mrs. Smith Thank you very much for your letter, which I received yesterday. I am sure,  together we can spent a good student conference in my college. I will give you now some useful information. First of all, we come to some important points for the organisation. The group has been booked into a comfortabel and well situatet hotel, whose name is  ,,Palace Hotel"". The hotel is on the right hand side of the Parker Piece, which you can find on the map, which I will send you. The ,,Palace Hotel"" is 5 minutes walking from the station. The conference is situatet in the building opposite the bus stop. After a short speech from our director, the evening entertainment will be begin. In a well know and enjoyable pub in the city centre we consume same food and drinks. Furthermore there will be a very famous life band. You do not have to wear some speciall clothes. You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoon. Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but some thing  specially is our cathedrale. The architecture bring you back into the old time.  as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing. We have also an interesting museum and a modern theatre. Finally, I am sure you and your group will spent some funny realaxing days . Please do not hesitate to contact me for some more information. I look forward to meeting each other soon. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Inventions have affected all our lives! What is it what we use every day  many hours? Sometime's  early in the morning until late in the evening. Yes it is the TV. It is well know in almost all family,  often with a lot of different cannels. First of all, the TV can tell us news in a short time,  what happened all over the world. Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is, that they telling about interesting reports, for instance about animals or  different culture from other countrys. Furthermore they have a lot of different programme, usually something for everybody. It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work. Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can watching the weather  and all of them were present in wonderful colour. To sum up, in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention. However, they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children. I can not imagine to live without televison, it is something what we need for our education,  for getting news and other helpful information. ",26
198," Dear Sir, I have read your advertisement for the show  and I went to the theatre to see it but I had a very disappointing evening. In your advertisement,  said that one of the actor was Danny Brook but it was a different actor. This was very disappointing and I believe that all the people there, were angry. The musical show must have been started at half past seven but it started at quarter past eight. About the tickets, I the advertisement said that discounts would be available but it would not. Also the theatre restaurant was closed and I do not know why. When I read the advertisement, it said that the restaurand would be opened. Lastly, I want to tell you that I had not  a perfect evening and I would be grateful if you could send me my money back. I am looking forward to your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my best friend. She lived next to my house and we went to the same school. I told her all my problems and I could rely on her. One day I heard my mother to tell my father that she want to divorce because she can't live with him any more. When I heard it, I went to my room and I was crying. I called Pat to come to my house because I was not very good and  to tell her what had happened. Few minutes later Pat came to my house and I told her that my parents are going to divorce. Pat did not believe me and she started to ask why. I told her that I did not know. She helped me to forget it for a few minutes, she made me to laugh and the she left. But before she left I begged her not to tell anybody. The other morning I went to school and all the students came next to me and told me not to be mad because of my parents. Then I realised that Pat told  my secret and I felt very angry, that's why I said at the beginning that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. ",28
919," Hi Helen, Im very excited because I won the first prize and my family is very proud of me. about the things you asked me in your letter I would like to go to camp California on july because that's the month when I go out from school and I have my vacations and I think it would be much easier that month. About my acommodations in the camp I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more confortable. The activities that I would like to do are signing because my friend told me that im good at it. and the other activitie that I would like to do is climbing because I thing it  very exciting although I have never tried climbing. because in my city there are no mountains. I just want to ask you for something else. How many jeans, Pants, sweater etc... do I have to take? and how much money would I need to bring in my pocket? I appreciate that opportuniti that you are giving to me and Im very thankful to you guys. atte. Henrique Aguilar  [SEP]  Dear Kim Im having a great time here in brazil, I have been going out with some friends an now I have a girlfriend. Shes very nice and very Pretty too., Well on march 11th there was  group here in brazil named ""Los Jagoares"" they sing pop music. and its one of my favorites and as you know I have a cousin that works as a organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and told me that if I would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and I said ""sureman"".

598," 13th June 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam, I am writing in response to your letter, in which you told me I am the winner in your competition, and my intention is to try to give you all the information you may need according to your letter. I would like to travel in July because I had another trip to Spain in August, that is the perfect month for me, otherwise I would not travel to Spain. About accommodation, I would prefer  tents instead of  log cabins and the reason is I have never used tents and this could be a very exciting experience for me. The two activities which I find  better for me are swimming and sailing. I love the sea, that is why I became interested in those activities since I was ten, therefore I have a lot of experience in both. Could you give me some advice about the weather in California? Thank you very much for everything. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, ION GAYARRE  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Thank you for asking about my latest good experience, I  let you know what the important details were. As you know I helped at a pop concert last month, I did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments, organise people, and also look after the clothes of the artists. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only wait there and give them what they asked for. Organise people involved, just a couple of things, say to people how to do the same as me and when. The most exciting thing was to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to the listen to the Concert in the very first position. All that I can say now is that I would do it again, I will never forget that day. Looking forward to seeing you, Best Wishes ",25
903," Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I would like to travel only in July because at that time I am going to be free to travel because of my holidays in the school. I would rather to stay in  tents, because I have stayed in tents before and I liked , it is more pleasent than stay in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience. Refering about sports I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions. About basketball, I would say I like it to play as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool, I was not as good  as in swimming but I like it. I think I do not have anything to ask you, I just want to thank you for everything. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I agree that shopping is not always ejoyable because a lot of things could occur  you. I remember when I was younger I used to go with my mom shopping to the stores but I did not like it, because I found  boring to buy clothes spending a lot of hours in a commercial centre. Another bad thing could be the enormous queues in the supermarkets, it is incredible how many time you can spend in there. The last month  was a robbery in a commercial centre next to my house, somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identifications, credit cards and cash, even more her flight ticket. Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancell their credit cards and to change her flight ticket. Unlucky lady. To sum up I would say that even when shopping is not always enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option. ",26
925," Dear Sir or Madam, I am glad to hear that I have won first prize, two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July because I will have my off in July. I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent. I think it would be more comfortable than a tent. I want to join swimming and tennis courses. I have been swimming from my  five years of age  until 1993  as a member of  school team. I am good at timing on swim. I am also good at playing tennis. I won a prize in a competition in 1999. I would like to ask about the money. Is everything free? Do I need to bring money for anything extra? but also I would like to learn about clothes. Do I need any special clothe? Will you provide it? and Do I have to pay for clothes? If you  reply  my letter until  28th of June I'll be pleased with it because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  - SHOPPING - Who doesn't like shopping? Everybody likes  from a child to an old lady in  sixties but it is not always enjoyable. When you get home tired after spending all your morning and afternoon at shopping you'll want to go to bed because you were looking for only a suit during all day and you couldn't find the perfect one. The only thing is we need to know what kind of thing do we want to buy and where could we buy cheaper and more quality stuff. We have  few possibilities. We can look up a magazine or a booklet which deliver with  newspaper weekly. We can order a free book from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is the internet shops recently so you don't need to see long-face staffs in the shops. You won't wait in the quee. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer. I think you won't be tired and bored   end of your shopping on the computer. Think about  that way for enjoyable shopping. ",29
501," Dear Sir I am writing to complain about a terrible performance in your theatre. I had expected to see the fantastic musical show. However, everything was not performed as you had advertised. Firstly, there was a different actor/actress who I have never heard their name before. Even though they performed their parts excellently I was very disappointed about your incorrect advertisement. Secondly, the musical was not started on time. It was going to start  19.30. However, It was started 45 minutes later. Afterall, I lost my find return train after  show. thirdly, there was no discount about my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired. Finally. It was  perfectly terrible evening out. So, I want you to give my money back to me. If you don't do that, I will tell  public what you are wrong in your advertisement. Your sincerely. Yeung  [SEP]  When I was a yong child, I used to be interested in reading a scientific fiction. Interestingly, nowadays, I live in the scientific world which I read  in the book. Probably, I started useing  mobile-phone 5 years ago. Before using  mobile-phone, if someone wanted to talk to me immediately, they couldn't find me where I was. However, nowadays, it is easy to find me because of  mobile-phone. I used to write a letter to my friends. However, After  appearing   Internet, I've sent e-mail to my friends. It takes just a few minutes to send e-mail to some one. I just check my e-mail before going to bed everyday. In conclusion, Because of modern technology, I'm very comfortable and  do something effectively with  computer and mobile phone. ",30

1226," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing to you to give you the information about the conference. The hotel your group has been booked into is called  Palace Hotel. It is simple to find the way from this hotel to the conference. You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel. There you will find a modern building with two different doors a red  and a blue one. You are asked to take the blue door. After entering you will see the signed conference room. We organized a end-of-conference party on the day before your departure. Everyone is welcome to join   this party   to get to know each other in a good atmosphere. You should wear nice and comfortable cloth. This is an informal party. I suggest you visiting the old part of Zurich or going to the zoo before your departure. I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference. If there is any question left, please contact me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Most Important Invention I love baking cakes, cockies and breads. Baking is  passion and in the town  I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area. It doesn't matter in what kind of mood I am, I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good. But I couldn't bake without an oven. I'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion. I think the oven is one of the most important inventions. If there is someone who doesn't agree with me, he or she should try to live  one month without using the oven. Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys. I'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes. I'm thanking the person who invented the oven. Thank you! ",36
1119," Dear Mr. Robertson, As we have seen the advertisment of the programmed the school set for us as a farewell activities, we are very appreciate and would like to thank  for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class which we hardly done it before. However, on the March 14, there is the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is also interesting for us. As you know all of us in this class are preparing to go in for the art & design school in the next semester. So this is a great oppotunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will have a fashion show, a demonstation from make up artists, and a contest for hair stylist. Furthermore, most of the famouse brand of sport were companies will join in this exhibition with their new product for the coming season. We would like to know if all of us can join in this event. We all agree that we are going to join the school trip to  Science Museum, which is the most interesting trip for us. Anyway, intstead of go shopping in the afternoon session, we will attend the show. This is the solution that we all think it will be the less effected to the other students, as the school do not need to re-arrange all the trip just because of our special interesting. We hope  much that you understand, and would like to thank  in advance for your cooperation. We looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I had never wanted to be a hero It was dangerous, but I know I had to do it. Even though all of my friends who were with me in that day all said ""Just let it go, it's just only a puppy. Why do you have to take a risk?"" It seemed that all of them didn't have any sympathy to that lovely blue eyes puppy that somebody who have no mercy just left it there, in a highway. If you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got off  the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side. It was true that small dog were in danger, but your life was in that situation as well once you decide to do that brave thing. All my body was shaking, and I would almost have turned back to my car if I didn't here that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner. So I just crossed the road, and jumped, picked him up. I feel like I was a hero at that moment, even though I'd never though of it before. ",24
32," 2 Desember 2000 Dear Mrs Clark: I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added in next year's International Arts Festival, wich in my opinion has been a great idea to create. Although I have read that Starts and Artists came frome around the world, I have realised that they only came from only six countries. I spent a good time in the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personaly think that It would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films. The rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive, I think that  ticket was exellent for us because of its price. I look forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  2 Desember 2000 Dear Andy: I'm sorry I haven't written for so long, but I have been very busy with my exams. It's good to hear that you have passed all of them. In your letter you told me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion for your homework ?Don't you? You know that I'm studing in a hard school, and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework everyday. The other day I arrived five minutes late and the teacher ordered me to go home. ?Do you understand this? She might be crazy I have friends that are studing in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom. At home it's very different, as you know I have a very good parents that let me do a lot of things. they let me go out with my friends every day, but they make me do homework and I hate this!! I hope that it is what you wanted from me. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours ",34
217," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre yesterday. I had really expected the show because it was the first time I had seen it in London and I was attracted by your advertisement which looked very exciting. However, I found it very disappointing. Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes on the seat so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not  actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all. Finally, to make matters worse, your restaurant had already closed after finishing the show so I could not eat anything. You mentioned that ""Your perfect evening out!"" in your advert. but it was not absolutely true! So I must insist that I want to have a full refund. I look forward to receiving your cheque as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For many years scientific and technological break throughs have changed our lives. I think that the more technological developments we have the more comfortable lives we enjoy. Amaisingly, we can find that computer users are getting more and more. So the life is much faster and more convenient than before. My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computer or mordern technology. First of all, using  computer is the most important  for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad. I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E-mail is brilliant for my life. In addition to this, doing  internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world. Before I go on holiday I use  internet to book or get details from  travel agency, which means I could save my time and physical energy. In conclusion, in my opinion, there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say ""Enjoy your lives"". ",31
12," Dear Mrs Clark, The discovery of the ôInternational Arts Festivalö was a pleasure for me because it gave me the opportunity to enjoy onto a really nice environment. The proposal of reasonably-piced package including tickets and accomodations, well supported my personal organization: comfortable rooms  easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide  at  last minute. As far as the Festival itself is concerned some small improvements could let it works better.  Different kinds of music is a good idea but some of them need special features. Larger concert halls can allow people to better enjoy the quality of  performances. Also the introduction of different cultural experiences is a good idea but six countries can't be really considered as world wide representative. The aim to satisfy different interests should not let the quality decrease. Just a final note: why not  more plays and films for the next year? Thanks in advance for your attention Regards  [SEP]  Are you young, are you a student? Do you want to earn money? You are not alone! There are ôseveralö opportunities for you: - ask for money to your parents (mum is better), is the most traditional way but also the safest one - emprove your kindness and ask for works in restaurants or pubs,  is a good training period for real life too (be patient with demanding people is always required) - test your health and ask for an outdoor activity (seting as  sandwich-man can also hep to test your pride) - check your pal wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Phili, Cuba, Zambania,  Morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer small wages for ôsmallö jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö Anyway, the best suggestion is always the ôbest ideaö, the famous ôsuch a good ideaö that might change your lifeà. O'm still looking for it. Good luck! ",30
355," Sir Manager, My name is Sandre Atos, I am writting to you because this last weekend I went to the theatre, you manage, to see what was called ""London's newest and best musical show"". However, I must say, it was quite the opposite. First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced for a disappointing actor. Besides  the spectacle was setted up to   19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe in that, everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud. I was told that I would have a perfect evening, though instead of that I had a terrible one. That's why I am writting to ask for some money back, I believe I have this right.  [SEP]  Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing  could ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day  television came to my house, I was only seven, everybody was exciting about the new ""toy"", however what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned  to rule our lives. Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights, playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to science development, I am getting better, recovering from ahsma. In addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat, thanks for the microwaves invention. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological facilities, but a very happy and united family. ",30
1098," Dear Mister Robertson Thank you very much for organising the programme of our three days visit to London. The programme looks very good, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme of our trip. We have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go to the show. We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest to replace the shopping part on Tuesday afternoon by the visit of the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometimes later. Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change of the programme. We are sure this is suitable to all of us. Thank you very much. Best regards  [SEP]  The home of the future The view from outside will mainly be the same. The houses will look like the houses  today. A simple and well-proofen architecture. The difference will be inside the buildings. The doors would be the entrance to another world.... The fridge, the television, the stove and the Hi-Fi equipment will be attached to a computer network. Every electronic gadget in the futur home will be able to comunicate with other machines or computers. It will be possible to connect to the Internet from nearly everywhere in the house or flat. I'm sure all the things which are based on electronic parts will totally change. Also the aspects of security within people's homes. But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes. All the big and small things which are defining people's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture, the pictures on the wall.... I suppose our future homes will be a mix of new technologies and good old tradition. It has always been like that. ",32
1121," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing about our class trip to London. First of all, I appreciate you well-organised programme, especially,  ""River Trip to Greenwich"" which we requested. It would be the most excising activity in this trip. However, I saw the advertisement of ""THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW"" in the newspaper today, and told all  classmates about it. We are very interested in going  this show. So I would like to suggest you to change the part of  programme for visiting this show. This show is held in  Central Exhibition Hall, London on Tue. 14, March, and  open from 10:00 to 19:00. We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles which we will learn  next term. Therefore, I think it is  great idea to visit the show for our knowledgement. Furthermore, the addmission is free for students. Unfortunately, our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme. For example, ""shopping on 14, March' can be changed to 15, March instead of ""Free time"". So we will be able to use the time at the afternoon on 14, March for visiting the show. I hope that you would give us an opportunity to visit the show. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people said that famous people such as politicians, and film stars, needs to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. I strongly agree with this. Firstly, most people might remember the sad story of ""Princess Diana"" she died in Paris  few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called ""Paparach"". If she was not followed by journalists, she wouldn't die. So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without  private life could be the victim. But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion. Moreover, people are interested in their life style. I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after ""Princess Diana's"" accident. However, secondly, famous people are not ""ailen"" so that they might do something, for example, ashame things in  public space or argument with  partner or family even put on  swimming costume like us. So they can be just ordinaly people like us. We have to think about  this way. Overall, people should think  if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need  private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life. ",27
930," Helen Ryan Competitor Organiser Dear Helen, I am writing to you in replay to the letter I have recently recived, to inform you about some details that I am concerned about. First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and, afterwards, I will start my university studies in September which means  lots of things to be sorted out. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easyer for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants. In your letter you settled the possibility  to choose two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join to basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them due to I've played  in my secondary scholl as leader of my team and due to my long training periods in lifting weights. Lastly, do I need to take with me any special staff of clothes? Do I need some money? and if it is so, how much? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory. There is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like. All this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half  price in another shop. ",30
53," Dear Mr/Mrs, I've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to it. I must say that  International Arts Festival is really  great idea. And your last festival was very intresting too. But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful. First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there are people only from six countries. I think it can make your festival more popular. Jazz, rock and classical concerts are amazing, but I think that some concert halls are too small, so not everybody can come. Your dance shows are very beautiful,  art exhibitions is something original and exciting. And also it is very interesting to talk with writers. I think that one reasonably-priced weekend  for all events is  exellent idea because it isn't so Expensive as buying  ticket to each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue to making your festivals. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tom, How are you? Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting. The question you asked me in it is very original too. I must say that  rules aren't  same in  schools of our country. Every school has it's own rules. I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students. We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem. So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers. I'm allowed to do many things at home. My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right. And the main reason Why our family is so friendly, it's because we haven't go many rules. So, I think there isn't something I'd like to change. I hope everything is good in your family and your school. Take care, ",23
1043," To Mr. Robertson I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London. I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking  and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum. This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down. I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on. I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time. Please give this your careful consideration.. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In a country like the UK, we are all bound to have houses. We either own it, or we simply borrow it from other people. We take our homes for granted. Think about the people in the poor countries! They struggle to survive. However, as we approach the future, our homes will start to change. Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives? I doubt it. There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homes might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and  risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery. The future homes will also have many similarities, such as having a separate bathroom, and not having one in a bedroom, or having two floors or having garages. It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. What do you think will happen in the future? ",32
1041," Dear Mr Robertson, I'd like thank you  to take us on a trip to London and have made such a good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich. It also will be ""The London fashion and leisure show"" on the 14th of March, which consist on an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Indeed it will be free for us as we are students. As you know we are in England to learn your language and also  your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country! May I suggest an alternative ? We could go to  science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery . We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would leave us go to  show on tuesday, because we can use the wednesday's free time to do our shopping. I hope that my idea sweet you and you'll agree. Sincerely,  [SEP]  Tuesday, 12th December Dear Annette, Thank you for your letter, like usual, it's a pleisure to receive a word from you. I understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present, and you'd like give to him a book, which, I think, it's a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastique book, which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories. It's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties. I recone that it's quite not an easy reading, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's such good in litteracy, that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personnality. It'll be a good point for her general culture, Wuthering Heights it's a classic, which everybody knows about it, even if they didn't have read it, they, at liest, know the story. Let me know what would be your choice. Love from, ",24
94," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I have recently been in London for spending a week's holiday. As I am an enthusiasmic of musicals I went to see this musical show. I am very disappointed because the things that were writen on the advertisment were not really true. It was writen that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there was playing another one. I felt abosolutly disapointed. The musical should have begun at 19:30, but it started at 20:15; it is inacceptable! It was writen too that there were discounts available and I asked for them and they said me that they weren't allow to do any discount. After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks. As you say in your advertisment it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Ms MARIA AROZ  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life. On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day. Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone, if you get lost somebody could find you. I think that the most important  modern technology in these days is  internet. With  internet you can do whatever you want without going out home (shoping, speaking with a friend, working, putting your money aside....) On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies. To sum up modern technology has change a lot our daily life and this is going to increase. ",24
33," Dear Jane Clark With attendance to the annual international arts festival which you took place on 21 and 22th November 2000, I spend  tremendous two days enjoying some features. Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations. Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there were some variety of features in it. Next, One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also  fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket. However, according to my notes, there are some doubt in the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact. The number of plays and films were also very few. In addition to that some concert halls were too small  to enjoy the concerts. On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars  more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place. I would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Albert Thanks for your letter, it was great to hear from you. I know you're fine, but I've been very busy studying because I have to take  exam next month. So this is  quick note to tell you what you want to know, as you asked about school rules and house ones. At school, the most horrible one is  school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes, colourful shoes and colourful socks. We can't also turn our hair colour an have to keep  hair length above  eye blows. Next, we're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we've students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them. However, at home I'm quite free. Just I can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I'm not allowed to play computer games  over two hours. These  are not so strict that I can stand them. I don't think I want to change them. Anyway, that's all about my  information which you want. Write soon, I look forward to hearing from you. Love ",33
461," Dear Manager: I am Angela Ounis and I am writting to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', London's newest and best musical show. I am very disappointing at this evening's show. First of all the starring that was supposed to be  (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there, I was so enthusiastic about your starring, when I realized was a failure, even though they do good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there, at 19:15, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15, it cannot be possible that a schedule for a show  have had a big change. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait forever until  you want. Also  was said that Discounts will be available, but I didn't received any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people, do it. On the other hand, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization. That was so uncomfortable, people was starving. I am so disappointed with this, that I am in all my right to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't   expected. Please let me know . sincerely yours  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I am 17 years old, and my life has been very normal. Since I've got a computer with  Internet, my social life has changed. Now I have more friends and I have more fun. This has helped me a lot, because I can talk with my friends that are living in other countries. Technology has a lot of programs that lead you communicate with others in a more easy way. 'Speak Freely' is fantastic, you don't pay and you can hear the voice of the one you miss. This has opened another world to me, distances aren't so sad, they are more close. I have learned a lot with  Internet, it gaves me the posibility to know more about things I've never knew . It is incredible how it opens  to you another reality, a different view of life. Now I have a different style of life, I am more open to  world's problems and progress. I am interesting in reading articles and developing myself. Technology had gave me another life,  has helped me. My knowledge has been developed and also my life style. I think that modern technology is our future, we don't have to depend on it, but we have to work for a biggest improvement. ",25
1205," 12th June 2001 Dar Mrs. Maria Smith, I am very glad to help you about the International Student Conference. I hope that our friend Richard Brown doesn't have any serious willness. Referent, where is the conference. This will be in the Casino Hotel and we don't need to worry for the best way  because in all the main routes in Devonport have signs with correct way to the popular hotel. After finish the conference, there is a party in  same hotel. In this party there are; some foods, soft drinks, music and a special place for dancing. This party is for the students so the kinds of clouthes won't be so formal. On the day free before catch our plane. We could chouse  two options for spending our free time. One is a guide tour on  center city, and another is visiting the chocolate factory. Please, if you have any more question, please call me at 38755980. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I can live without this. It's true. In our lifes, may be, couldn't be without electricity. Some people can live without this, but I am sure that the world would be very different. When we are using different equipments in our houses, we are using the electricity. Small things but very importants in our lifes. For example: T.V., computer, just light and a long list that now I can not write. I don't like tinking , my house of my life, without all this facilities. In winter when  is dark very early, and after, I need to spent my free time in home. What I can do without my music and my computer. Now, just you need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, aeroplans, shoops, all these things without lights. Finally. I think that everybody know that the electricity is  very important invent and for me it is the best. ",17
147," Sir manager, I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper. I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had, I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there, but when you said that  show was the best I decided to go. When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said. I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality, but that was not all. When the show started the person who was acting  it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor. Really he was bad. Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed. So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had. I am letting down because of your behaviour. You wanted to cheat me, so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back. I am looking forward  your answer. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world. First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too. Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - are making different things. For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone. I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes. A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before  reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven. In my case I dislike computers. I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier. On the other hand what will happen with us in the future? Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs. So, what are we going to do? Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution, so we have to be careful. ",29
1182," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. Surely I'll try to help you as good as I can. First, I  tell you the name of the hotel, it's the Palace Hotel. Fortunately, it is not far from our college. For getting from the hotel to the conference, you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College, where the conference will take place. About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest I still don't know  will be expected. I suggest to wear casual clothes, I think there's no need of school uniforms. To answer your last question, I would propose you to attend the local zoo, because many baby animals were born in the past few days. Dear Mrs Smith, I hope the given information is useful for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone Could you imagine there's no telephone ringing in an office? Or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend? Could you? I can't! The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century. It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in  future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately. When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village. Now I have my own flat, and the first piece of furniture I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home. ",34
473," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to hang me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot  good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late , we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen  and who seemed not to know by heart his role! Shame on you! After that ""show"" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize I want that you hang me my money back and very quickly. Your faithfully..  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology had changed  human being's daily life long before I was born. Nowadays according to me the most important revolution is connected with new technologies. Let's take the mobil phone. Our parents used the phone to make an important appointment. Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is ""mobil"". And I'm not different I've got one and it has changed my everyday life. I always can be reached, I can phone friends when I know I would be late and thanks to that appliance I feel less nervous and now I'm sure I couldn't live without it. It's the same with  Internet and that's a very new thing. I send and receive more mails than letters! I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I'm working because it take up just some minutes. With  Internet and according to me the world is become smaller and bigger at the same time. Smaller because I can visit an American library without leaving my desk and bigger because it seems to be endless. Yes my daily life has been changed and it's a good thing. ",32
64," Dear Jane Clark, I would like to congratulate you on your wonderful ""Arts Festival"". You have a really great idea to create this sort of Festival. I had a lot of fun to go there. I would like to come next year with a great pleasure. I hope you will not  angry if I give you some advice? At first, I would like to talk about your section ""Stars and Artists"". This section is really great and attract a lot of people. From my point of view, it will better if you have some ""Stars and Artists"" from only six countries. Because the spectators will probably  more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities. I also would like to talk about your concerts. The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something for these problems? All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of ""Plays and films"". I love films and Plays also, and I'll hope to have more films or Plays next year. Concerning the tickets, I think your price is reasonable for this festival. It is a good idea to have reasonably-priced  for weekends. I'm looking forward do hearing from you, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Phil, I'm really happy to receive your letter and I hope you are fine. I'm fine but I have a lot of work to do for my school. My exams start the next month that's why I have a lot of work. In your letter, you want to know about my school rules in France and you also want to know what I am or I am not allowed to do at home. Alright, I'm going to answer your questions. At first; . You are not allowed to smoke, drink or to take some drugs in my school. You must to be outside during the break. You must sign your notebook to your parents every week. You are not allowed to argue with your teacher after you receive an exam. You must to be on time at school or you have a punishment. I have so many other rules but these are the most important. At home, I'm not allowed to watch television after 8 p.m. I must do my home work when I come back at home. I also must to help my parents in home activities. For example; to clean my room and the other rooms, or to cook, etc.... I Hope these information will help you, Keep in touch, Love. ",25
483," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show I saw at the Circle Theatre on Wednesday, June, 14th which was titled ""Over the Rainbow"". First of all, the advertisement I got layed emphasis on Danny Brook's starring , but eventually, a disappoint unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills to. To make matters worse, not only was the restaurant closed, without any appearant reason, but also the discounts that were said to be available were not. On top of everything, the performance began forty-five minutes late. I find it unbearable to witness such a lying advertising and to pay even ten pounds to spend such a disappointing evening. Consequently, I ask for  money back, and I will not obviously go back in the Circle Theatre. I join my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she had caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential, Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested in it, and decided to lead her own enquiry about this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story looked very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat reached her purpose by questioning carefully her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to rob this camera unless he wanted to be hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the adults' help. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She  convicted the two criminals, and had the calm gone back within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone  telling a secret, and she realized she had made the good choice. ",26
846," 13rd of June Dear Helen Ryan, I was really happy when your letter arrived and I node that I won the first prize in your competition. I have never been in the U.S.A. Now I will give you the informations which you asked for. For me it is only possible to travel in July. That is the only month where I have time because after July I have to start with the University. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I am used to it. When I was a child my parents and I spent a lot of time at camps. You wrote that I should choose two activities. I have chosen golf because I playing golf sine 1998 and I want to improve it and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start with climbing. I could play in the first week golf and in the second I could start with climbing. What about money and clothes? You know what kind of clothes I need and could you give some advices  how much money I will need? Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it. Honestly I had never a shopping tour which I didn't enjoy when I was alone. I can remember one shopping tour which I had  with a man and it was  nightmare. It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows and it is not easy to buy shoes you have to choose carefully. I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything. We left the shop without  shoes, in  horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour which was not enjoyable. To sum up, my advise is that the women should go alone or with a female friend. ",26
1206," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to you to give you more informations about an international student conference. The group has been booked into  King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is  following the rod in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called  White House. At the end of  conference, we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college. As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country. Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or  do some shopping at High Street. If you want more information, please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mr. Bill, I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit. It is called Penrhyh Castle, as the building will tell you all about Wales. On the positive side, you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall, on the door and some furnitures. The building itself looks splendid and beautiful. On the other hand, you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old wooden floor which causes some noise. And some old toilets might look awlful. But in my recommendation, I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building. Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country. As Wales is not modern like America, so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things. Yours sincerely, ",28
282," Dear Sir, Last Saturday evening me and my family went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. I'm writing this letter to express the reasons of our disappointment about that evening. The advertisement for the show said that there was discounts available for children so we brought them and when we bought the tickets we had to pay the maximum price for everyone. Then, when we got in, we had to wait because the show started forty-five minutes late. By then our children were very bored. My husband was looking for to seeing his favourite actor, Danny Brook, and when the show started he found out that Brook had been changed by a different actor. My husband was really unhappy. When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack to the theatre restaurant and it was closed without  giving any reason for it. As you can see, it wasn't the evening we expected and the result was very different from the promises you made in the advertisement. I think it would be reasonable if we could have our money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as succesful as we thought. My and my friends, including Pat, were preparing a surprise for Sam's birthday. We decided to go to his place (I've got a copy of the key) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch, then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived. Everybody was excited about the idea and we were keeping it in secret in front of Sam. Two days before the event Carol, Albert, Sam and me went to visit Pat in her house and she invited us to stay for dinner. We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answer it. It was her aunt inviting her  for the weekend so Pat said very loudly: ""I'm sorry but I have to go to Sam's flat and decorate it, it's a surprise, don't tell anybody"" Sam look at us surprised and said ""What's going on?"" Everybody had to change  plans and the party became a normal party. We were a bit disappointed but we enjoyed  anyway. ",36
1160," Dear Mrs Smith, Hello Maria. In this letter you will get all the information that you need. The hotel that group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel (In the Victoria road). And you can take the Bus in front of the hotel to go to the College. It is four bus stops . Then walk straight for five minutes, you will see the college. After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds. The rest you already knows. I suggest to wear shirts and jeans. And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the ""Imax"" cinema to watch a 3-D film! After we eat in the KFC. Then we all take you and the students to the airport. That's all. I wait you. Your sincerly  [SEP]  Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places. But the best place for me is ""La Vaguada"". An entertainment and commercial building. In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas, can watch a film and eat all kind of food and have shopping. We can have fun as well. And that's why I recommend this place to you. The building itself is a large building. It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras. The buildings seems to be very new but it is quite old. People love this place and called it ""Madrid-two"". Around it, there are many restaurants and shops as the building bring a lot of people. Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well. And it is easy to come. Just take the bus 83 or the sub-way. In here, you can find everything that you want. Hope you like it. ",26
844," Dear Helen, I learnt from you letter that I've won the first prize. I felt how luck I was. I understood you want to know when am I available to set off and where I'd like to stay. First of all I will be able to go   U.S.A  in July because of my university. I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays. My exams will have finished at the end of June. I will only be able to set off in July and I also will give my thesis to my teacher in August. This holiday will help me to think   and prepare it. I'd prefer staying in  log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study . Basically, I don't like staying in a small tent. When I get  the camp, I'd like to swim and climb. I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing. I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer. I'd like to ask some questions  which I want to know. Is there any toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby? Do I have to bring any special clothes? Do you have any idea what is the weather going to be ? How much mone do you recommend me to bring with me? Is the camp close to  town or city? Will you provide me  an instructor when I climb and swim? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I haven't written  you for ages. I do apologise for this. How are you? How is your new school and  parents? I hope we can catch up with each other's news. Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert. It was unbelievable and tiring as well. I saw all the pop bands and singers. I heard them talking behind the stage. They signed my diary and took a photo with me. Being a security guard was the hardest task. Carrying big speakers  place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh. Believe it or not I put make up on one famous singer's face. I was just walking down by  dressing room   manager said that if I could help them. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was in her room and helping her. Especially I liked that time. I advise you to do something like that. I'm going to help them again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, ",32
305," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the terrible evening I spent in your theatre. Just to remind you of which show I am talking about, it is called ""Over the Rainbow"". There were  couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made  fool of my self by arriving late and  all those people starring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board, it said that they are available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day. The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back. Yours faithfully, Raulet.  [SEP]  Well, for instance people in Roman times (Roman soldiers) didn't have any sort of transport to move them from one place to another. The only way they could move was  their feet. They could walk over 4 km per day without any breaks. But people in nowadays like me can't even walk 1 km. And also what is the point of walking when you have cars and buses or even bikes. Phones also affected my daily routine. If I wanted to find one of my friends, I had to run around our hood finding him but now, I just have to phone  on his mobile phone and just ask him where he is. Computers changed my daily routine because when I was younger, I was spending most of my days outside playing basketball but now, I just play on the computers all day. E-mails are also one of my examples. When e-mails didn't exist, I was writing letters and it took longer to get to the person I am writing to but with e-mails, the person could receive my message within  few seconds and you don't have to count in how many days  he will receive it. So in my opinion, modern technology changed my daily routine quiet a lot. ",30
19," Jane Clark Organizer of  International Arts Festival Dear Sir, Mine name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival. The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event. First, I would like to congratulate you for the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be profitable for next year's Festival. The artists you brought were only from six different countries, so I think you should next time try to offer us people from more different nationalities, to make it more interesting than it is already. Moreover, I have been thinking about changing the location because, as you probably already know, some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go in. Finally, I just would like to recommend you not to give up showing movies, during the Festival because the crowds were amazed with that, and keep on offering the current prices, one of the best deal for us, the spectators. If you would like to talk about my suggestions, please, do not hesitate  and let me know. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Independent Student Magazine Here is my article. There are many ways to earn money, specially in a big city, like the one where we are studing all year around. Some examples could be delivering pizzas or newspapers, working as a bartender throug the nights, cleaning services, etc. I usually call these jobs non- cualified positions. I think, as a consecuence, that there is no difficulty in finding a job for our spare time. What it really makes us, the students, upset, is to find the perfect job. To be more technically and specifically, we need a very flexible job, wich gives  independence and allow us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period. Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us should be a position related with our carreer. Next year I expect myself finishing my studies in LAW. And by that time I will have already some experience, so that I will more easily  able to apply for a really good job. So, Why don't we think more about the future, instead of being upset of how to get some money to spend  next party? ",24
798," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California, so I am writing to you to indicate  my preferences for the travel and the accomodation. I have no particular needs but one: it will be necessary for me to travel in July because my work will keep me very busy in all  other months. About the accomodation, I have no problems, but I would prefer staying in  tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous. During the holiday, I would like playing tennis and golf. I can play tennis quite well, but I have never played golf, so, if it is possible, I would like taking lessons with a teacher. I would like to know also what I will have to pay  with my money and how the climate is at Camp California, because I have to decide which clothes to bring. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely, Clara Mancini  [SEP]  People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes. A man usually is less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay  what his wife has bought. In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the contrary, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when there is a lot of crowd. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend a hour to buy some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other. The better thing to do to skip queues and crowd is not to go shopping on Saturdays, but it is not always possible. ",31
994," Dear Madam: I just receive your letter with the good news. I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June. For the accommodation I would like to have  log cabins rather than  tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy. I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities. I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers. Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget. Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food. On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family. I start thinking  what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost. In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort  choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depends on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested  to please.

215," London, 20th may, 2000 Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam, I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I have seen last Sunday at the evening. Firstly, I become very disappointed because of the actor, who was different from  your advertisement, not Danny Brook was starring. Secondly, I was ready at 19:30 time, as you have announced, and I had to stay waiting in front of the theatre until 20:15, when finally the show began. Besides of all, at the end of the Musical, I went to the your Theatre Restaurant, in order of taking a dinner, because I have leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time. Thus, you cann't believe what was my disappointment when I noted that it was closed, without no explanation. Finally, I would like to say you that I am asking for  money back, because I had an evening totally despleased, completely different  that you have anouced in your advertisement. So, I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all, modern technology have changed my daily life  the last five years more quickly than in the anchient time, or even than a ten years ago. I became to notice the difference in my work, since when all tasks have changed to the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine. In addition, at the University teachers not accepted  more written tasks done by hand, but only they should be written by  computer. Besides, teachers began asking us  a lot of article  to be copied throught the internet. From that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge. Firstly I become to write letters and articles, next I learned several computers plays. When I learned how to use  internet, I didn't stop until now. Nowadays, I cann't stay one day without consulting computers communications throught e-mail or  internet. I change corespondecies with all my family by  internet,  my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and so with a brother who live in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand. On balance, I can affirm that I couldn't  without this modern technology today. My life wouldn't be the same another time without these progress. ",23
693," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to let you know my decision about  your letter, which I have received recently. I would like to thank you for  competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition. I think, I could have an holiday just in July because I will have been working in my previous company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one month holiday period from my company. I would rather prefer to stay in the tent than to stay in the log cabin because the tent is more enjoyable. I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailling because I have been joining these kinds of activities for five year and I had  really good training about sea-sports. Should I take my clothes with me or are they arranged in the camp placement? Also, how much does it cost. I am looking  to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I hope you and all your family are well and everything is ok. I'd like to tell you about what exciting experience I had last month during a pop concert. I wish you were there and saw the concert, it was really brilliant. As you know I'd never been to any activities like to be a valunteer before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an adversitement on the tv. It said, ""be a valunteer for our concert and get a free ticket"". After that I applied and they accepted my application. You should have seen , there was  really terrible rush before  concert and everybody was runing around to do something. I helped to carry huge speakers to the concert venue. Than I was told to stay in front of the entrance door and check the tickets. Some people tried to enter without any ticket but they weren't allowed  by  police. Finally, I helped them,  in return I had  good experience as well as enjoyed listening   music. Love ",28
659," Dear Madame, I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know  to have won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, call the information you need to complete the partecipation procedure. I would like to travel only on July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at the Cornell University: this school is closed on July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the  accomodation I prefer is in tent. there are two main reasons for the choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the relative activities: building-up the tent, cooking on camp and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the camp daily life (the tent, the sleep bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like the water sport and I am a quite good guitar  singer - Some questions: What about the average temperature at the camp on July? What are the better clothes to use at the camp? How much money may be useful at the camp? I will be very glad to partecipate to your camp! Yours faightfully Steve Galliano  [SEP]  Our school, as it is well known, is a technical school and consequently the daily life contains different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, showed to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create the video. The mathematical lessons are divided in two part: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will be surely enclosed in the video. Moreover, many sport activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on. Some parts of the final video may describe these additional features of the school. ",32
1029," 1st. March, 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you for organising the programme about the trip to London. There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and especially they are looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting  National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London. The students in my class have just seen the advertisement for a show in today's edition of The Times. There will be The London Fashion and Leisure Show in Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March. It starts  10:00 am and finishes  9:00 p.m. All of my classmates would like to go there because it is a great chance to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Besides, students don't have to pay  entrance fee because it is free for students. The fashion show is only on the 14th of March, so I would be grateful if you could allow all of my classmates to go there after visiting  Science Museum instead of going shopping. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life. However, in my opinion, famous people, such as politicians and film actors, deserve to have a private life. First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time. Another reason that I agree  famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was  ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death. To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media. ",30
299," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to you in order to describing my last visit in your theater. Unfortunatly I am a very disappointed about  organisation in your company. Firsty the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price  £20 because discounts were not available although on your advertisement there were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the grateful Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and it was singing a mother unknown person. And last but not least I recognised after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come... I don't know  it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatrer that  is promised much more then the people can get for their money, or  it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I am not agree with such  situation and would ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed. I am looking forward for you answering. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously. First of all it changed our life-style. For example ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TV. Because the people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobil and can spend their free-time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more open for the world. Secondely we can do our jobs today more efficient. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our partner faster and better and offer them better service. The ordered goods can be deliver in  shorter time by train, trucks and modern ships.

308," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the show you presented two weeks ago at your theatre. As I was spending a week-end in London I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking  to have it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food . In conclusion, I would like to have the two tickets refunded considering also that there were no discounts available, as instead it was stated in the advertisement. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main cause of Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever teen-ager and while she was attending the Secondary School she had many troubles with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would have never passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year-old but still well-looking and all my girls school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign. The trial was long and had a wide coverage by  media. We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing.

182," 17.06.2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I have recently been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow'. To my regret, the evening totally failed to live up to my expectations. The advertisement provided false information, e.g. the names of the actors were incorrect - Danny Brook was not performing. I have to say, this fact disappointed me very much. Moreover, the show started late: instead of 19.30 ( time in the advertisement) people were allowed in at 20:15, resulting in  waiting time of 45 minutes. There were two other problems: there were no discounts contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repairement works. This evening, as you can see, proved to be far from perfect. Therefore, I would like to have my money back. Please contact me for more details if necessary. Yours faithfully, Miss Nitya Ramel  [SEP]  We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices, which would seem fantastic to our ancestors. My daily life has been changed much by modern technology without me noticing it up to this point. Just looking around, I realise that modern technology has crept into every area of my life. I would rather type some coursework up than hand-write it. This made my life easier, and at the same time saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut . When I am too tied to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with this opportunity. Using the Internet, I can meet people  all around the world not going anywhere. With all the resources on the Net I don't need to go to the library as often as I used to. I guess I haven't realised until now how much my daily life has been changed by modern technology. This leaves me wondering how beneficial its influence is for me. ",39
982," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter of 13 June. I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel only in July, because I have only one month holliday this year. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I think  is a great fun and a bit more adventurous. It is not too much confortable, but it is not a problem for me, I like this kind of holliday. I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity, I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I also will take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good occasion. I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with  and how many money, more or less, do you think I should take. Thank you  to ask me  my taste and to be preoccupated about it. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Audrey Gillett  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Like you know last month, I had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot. Firstly I had to make the decor of the scene, so I made in the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put  some blue lights. furthermore I made some stars in paper in argent color. But that was only the begining of my adventure. The most exiting part was when I had to make up the pop stars ! I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed, but I was too happy to show my shyness. Do you believe that I spoke with Micheal Jackson, my favourite singer? I can't believe it yet! It was a wonderful experience. I will remember that day for the rest of my life. It was like a dream who becomes tru. I wish you had been there with me. I can't explain how supper it was. I stayed with him until the concert begun and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers. Well, I have to leave you now, but I will tell you more details when we next meet each other. See you soon. Love, Audrey ",31
188," 17th December 2000 Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about my awful evening at the Circle Theatre. I am very disappointed. Last week I went to see a musical show called 'OVER THE RAINBOW' at the Circle Theatre. I was first, very excited to see the show, because on the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I can have a perfect evening at there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening. I went to see my favourite actor Danny Brook acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started late then I expected. It should be from 7,30 p.m, but it was from 8.15 p.m.! I want to complain about the ticket. On the advertisement it said that discounts are availble, but when I asked a staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went  the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed early than usual. I think they should keep the times correctly. I am very disappointed with everything what happened last week. I would like a refund. I excpect this will be possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future by XXX 17/6/00 My article is about fashion in.  future Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes. Like wearing T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc. They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes. Like earings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hairbands, hand bags, shoes, watches, etc. They like designers clothes and everyone wear different modern clothes in size, in colour and in shapes. The fashion gradually changed from the old days and it is still changing to the future. Maybe in 100 years from now, fashion will be totally different. Everyone may think that in  future people will wear silver clothes like in space movies. I think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in  future. Every one will wear very colourful balloons on them. With balloon clothes they will be able to fly up in the sky. Everyone will not walk on roads. They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes. In  future they will wear balloon clothes, because to make people fly. They will use a special gas inside  balloons to make them fly. For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will be not dangerous. If we use up carbon dioxide with  balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about Ozone breaking. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in  future. It is to save our Earth. Would you like to wear balloon clothes and bounce around the world? If yes, wait until  2100s! ",28
321," Dear Mister, I am writing from Paris where I live. My wife an I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago. We were really pleased because it was our first time in England. We asked our travel agent to organise our trip. My wife and I are both found of theatre, musical shows especially. It is so rare to see musical in Paris that we decided to book two seats for ""Over the rainbow"". We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly in the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 each seat. The worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really need singing lessons). After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. Perhaps it was a  luck! So we want you to give us our money back, the show didn't worth the price. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  And now, I was wondering if I had not made a mistake. My brother was too talkative! Two days before, I told him that our father was about to buy a brand new car. And he did not want our mother to be informed. It was supposed to be a gift for twenty years of marriage. A car only for her. The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret. And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing. Her reaction was not the one we were expecting. Apparently she was not surprised, but she was surely angry. Really angry!! She thought it was a stupid idea, and also an expensive one. According to her, this car would have been useless. She suspected our father to want to please himself. Then, we decided to offer her a red bicycle. It was the colour my father had chosen for the car! ",30
284," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"", which was played in the ""Circle Theatre"", because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all I would like to say something about the starring: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard about. So the main point of my visit had dissappeared. Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later. A serious theatre can't miss  such an important thing, the starting-time. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was going to pay for the tickets, I found another thing : there were no discounts avaible. In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence. But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed, without  saying the reason. I had to go back to the hotel, because all  restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded. Summing up, you might have noticed that that wasn't ""my perfect evening out"" wich you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back. This might be the only way I keep on relying on your theatre. I hope I will receive an answer. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and because of this Pat caused a big, but stupid problem. It was late in the night, and Pat was thinking about something Nick had told her that afternoon: - ""Don't tell Marie I was here"". Nick was Marie's boyfriend, and Marie  a very good friend of hers. They were in the shopping centre, and the problem was that Nick wasn't alone, he was with a very beautiful girl. What could Pat do? That morning Marie had told her that Nick couldn't go to the cinema with her because he had a lot of work to do in the afternoon so.. what was he doing there with that girl? In the end Pat phoned Marie and told her: she was a very good friend. Marie was so shocked that, as soon as Pat had stopped speaking, she phoned Nick and, without letting him say anything, she broke up their relation. But the truth was very different, because what Nick was doing there was something which had nothing to be with what Pat had thought. Nick was there because the following Sunday would be a very special day for him: he would have been going out with Marie for three years, and he wanted to buy a present for her. But..what about the girl? She was his cousin! She works as a model, and she was advicing him about which clothes, etc,... buy for her. Pat couldn't keep that secret, and in spite of helping Marie, she made a couple disappear. ",30
83," Ireland, 16 December 2000 Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November. I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to. However, I feel that it could be even better next year. Firstly, according to your advertisement, the 'Stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries. I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that ""our"" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented. In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music. I really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so! Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to. However, I think a weekend is really too short. May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Magda, Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some  school and home rules in my country, France. First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me. Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean  the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them. At home  is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay  very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noise""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere. Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon. With lots of love, ",34
124," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about a musical show which I've seen recently at your theatre. There are several reasones why I wasn't satisfied with it. Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor Danny Brook would play in the show. Despite it, a different actor stared in the performance, which was really disappointing. Secondly, the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be. Thirdly, no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets. Lastly, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show. That evening wasn't my perfect one out, although it was promised to be so in the advertisement. This is the main reasone, why I want to ask for a refund. In my opinion, this would be quite fair. I'm going to visit the Circle Theatre this Sunday. I hope I'll get at least a part of the money I've paid back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. During the centuries man's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more common clothes. I think we can make a conclusion: during the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common. People's clothes have been changing from metalwear to shorts and miniskirts. That's why I suppose, that man's clothes will be becoming more and more light. I think, they will be made of universal materials, which will be rather light and thin. People won't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies. Perhaps, clothes will be rather small. I think, that different tops and mini-skirts will become more popular. Maybe, people will create something even smaller than that. Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps, metalwear will become a craze again. ",25
120," Dear Manager A few days ago I went to the Circle theatre to see a musical show which it shows in your theatre now. Also it made me very disappoint. There are several reasons that I was not happy about the musical. The first one I am going to complaint about is the actor. I could not see Danny Brook during the show. There was an different actor instead of him. Secondly, the times, it's available  14.30 and 19.30 so I choose 19.30. However it was deleied  it started  20.15. Also I had a student identification card to discount the ticket price but it was unavilable to discount. The theatre restaurant was closed after the show, they said funds are runn out. Those are totally unexpectable so I presume that I would like to get paid for my ticket cost. I ask you to transfor money into this account. Barclays bank 1010-10 1234567 Jon Sun. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all it's difficult say what exactly modern technology is now but I can say for sure it's keep developing and much better than the past. Think about the conputer, the speed of conputer is much faster than before. I even couldn't imagine our p.c can be that fast. Also T.Vs, I guess that I was not able to watch colour T.V if I was born in 1960. T.V colour only consist of white and black. Nowdays the technology is keep develop and the better technology gives us  easier life. Another example, the internet. This is  revolution which has changed our daily life. You can have a shopping on the internet and it might  the fastest way to gather any information you would like to search. However it also can make our life very lazy. This is one other important thing to remember. People who have their  car, they don't attempt to walk on foot even if it is  short distance. The improvement of technology can makes our life easy and in the other way it also can makes our life lazy. ",23
73," Dear Ms Clark, I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich is a great idea. I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. As I saw on the advertisement, there were stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries . It would be better if there were more than six countries. I noticed that some concert halls were too small. I wonder if you could offer outside concerts. Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films. Don't you think you could create dramatic courses? Visitors could learn plays with professionals. Finally, the idea of a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we pay only once and we can see all the events. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter which I've just received. You ask me to tell you about school rules and what we are allowed to do at home in France. I don't think the rules are so different between England and France but I'm going to try to give you examples. Firstly, at school,  we missed a course, we must bring a medical attestation. Furthermore, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE. At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss  with our family. There are so many rules but it would be too long if I had to explain all of them. l'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, ",31
1209," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I will try my best to answer the questions. First of all, we have already booked the Five-Stars Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenent to come from the airport. You can take both by buses or taxies. The nember 101 bus starts from the airport, than you can get off from  ""city college"" stop. It would be a great chance to tark part in the party for everyone. This is just a relaxing party, just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better to wear a dress. Finally, about the free three hours, my personal prefer  to go shopping. Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England, there gathers so many shops. It  worthes tp spend time and money on that. I look forward to seeing you! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowdays people have become used to watching televesion's programs everyday. The TV is so important that you can see it in every family, and it is a essential equipment for everyone. First of al, in my opinion, TV has a great education functions, and  also makes the world become small. You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment. I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on  radio because the news on TV are vivid. Moreover, the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone. I would like to open  TV when I stay at home. Someone are talking, laughting, crying on there, so join them, you will feel much better than just yourself. Some TV programs are enjouable! However, TV also has some disadvantages. You might just sitting in front of  TV for hours learn nothing, or no more talk with your family. I think this is the badest influence in the society. In clucsion, the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages, but on the whole  advantages is greater than  disadvantages. So, but on the whole, TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world. ",19
223," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, On 14th June 2000 I went to see your ""Over The Rainbow"" musical show and I have a few points which I would like to bring to your attention. Your advertisement was featuring ""Danny Brook and Tina Truelove"" as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening. The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30 however the show started at 20:15. As I came to London on holidays and purchased ""The London City Guide"" I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance. Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were  quotas  available at that price but were already sold out! After the show we tried to go to your restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for renovation! I was very disappointed of my supposed ""perfect evening out"" to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY ""Technology"" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me. From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings to develop positively and negatively. Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc. were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today. Back in the 30's the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies. The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people.  The fast and growing computer industry is giving us less and less physical work due to a mechanical concept. Biotechnology is providing us with the latested discoveries to heal or improve the human body to  its most efficient state. Transport means are also part of the overall technology and allow us to go faster, further than before with less effort. Besides all those improvements and confort I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands. ",36
781," 13th June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan I received your letter and I am writing to give you the information you asked . First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in Aougust to earn money and after  (from September to June) I go to university as usual. About accomodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer of nature. I choose climbing and sailing for the activities. Although I have never climb (so I am a complete beginner). I am very interested in learning Climbing. But I sailed a long time ago so I am quite a beginner  too. Finally I would like to know what sort of clothes I should bring and also if I should bring some money. You can contact me for further information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Astrid de Martel Perrault  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, I was happy to receive your letter and, as you asked me, I will tell you how my experience was and how great it was. The most exciting thing when you help at a pop concert is that you can meet popstars, and, indeed, I met OUR favourite popstar! I talked to him and we ate a sandwich together talking about his album. I will never forget this moment. But don't worry, I thought about you and he signed an autograph for you, you will find it with this letter. On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the room and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are! But I could stand up on the scene and talk with the musicians. When I receive the photos I took, I will write  you again to give them to you. Looking forward to hearing from you Love, Astrid ",35
459," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago. I went to see it on 5th June 2000. First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor. Secondly the show started 45 minutes late. Then at the tickets-office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite  I am a student. Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished, obviously, late. I am really not satisfied with the show-organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different. For this reason I expect to receive my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secret. Last week we had another demostration of this. On Monday we decided to organize a surprise-party for Ted's birthday on Tuesday evening. Each of us had a different task. Anna prepared the cake, Peter organized the music, Heather and I went to buy the present; Pat said: ""OK I'll phone to some of Ted's friends to invite them"". Obviously Ted should  have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice: ""the party is a secret!!"" and she said: ""Yes, it must be a surprise!"" On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details; Pat said: ""I've just phoned to Tommy, Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening: they all have said ok for the party.."" In that moment she understood that something was wrong! ",32
699," Dear Mr Ryan I have just received your letter and I am really delighted and thrilled to win the first prize in your competition. For the trip to California, I can only go in July, I am afraid, because my English course finishes in June and it starts again in August. In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or  log cabin, and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please. Because last time I was in a tent, I found it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I couldn't got to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent. I would like to take part in surfing and swimming please. Although I have never done surfing before, I am a quite advanced swimmer. Finally I would like to ask some questions. What is the weather like over there and what should I wear? How much money would I need? How big is the camp? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Shopping can be very exciting and fun. The feeling of buying new things is wonderful. But it might not be the same everytime. We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying things neccessary is fine I think. But buying things that  do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But after you never eat them and just bin them. I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you don't need or unplanned, might make you feel sad after sometime. ",37
27," Dear Jane Clark, I had a wonderful time at the International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea  to enjoy arts from around the world, but I also have some complaints. First of all, I got disappointed when I found that there were no artists from Indonesia. There were stars and artists from only six countries. Secondly, the concert halls. The performances were great, but some halls were too small to accomodate so many people  there were that day. A crowded hall is not good  to enjoy musics. Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success. I liked  plays and films, and want to see more next year. The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy  arts without worrying about money. So all you need to improve  is to have larger concert halls. I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held using more notice boards. I have no doubt that you will succeed in next year's festival. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I would like to recommend the job, a home teacher. It is a job that you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house. The best advantage of this job is the payment. It is very good considering how less time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home teachers are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it means they take lessons after school, not in a daytime. So, in a daytime, we can focus in our studyings. It is not so easy for every student, though. Because teaching requires a lot of knowledge. You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, for it is your responsibility to provide your student  right information. As you see, teaching is a hard work in some respect. But I am enjoying it and getting a lot out of it. ",30
942," I'm so happy that I've won 2 weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At first I couldn't belive that I was a winer I would like to travel at the Camp in July, if is possible. This is just one months which I've fee.  I'm a student. My school starsts in September and it finishes in June. July is  months when I'm having a rest and I'm doing nothing. In August I'm working in the shop which is my sister. If I could go in July  would be greate. I can sleep in  tent, it would remain me  a good time which I'd spent with my friends a few years ago. I'm not scared of darkness, rain, cold or hot whether. I'm sure  would be good fun; sleep next to each other telling scared story. Is good for make friends, you can know them better doing everything together. Also I know that I have the chance to do two activities while I'm at the Camp. I would like to choose basketball. This is  sport which I ,,love"". I play basketball since I was 12. Some of my friends say that I'm  very good player, but I don't think so. Another sport which I'd like to do is swimming. In swimming I'm not as good as  in basketball, but I'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it. I would like to ask you, what sort of clothes shall I take with me? I don't want take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costium, T-shirt, sports shoes I think should b O.K. Know, I can just wait for July  [SEP]  Hi Kim! How are you? I'm fine. I'm so exited. Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine. It was  Tina Turner concert! To this moment when I'm thinking of it I want shout. At first I was helping to seill the tickets -  wasn't difficult. Anyway, four hours, before  concert had started, I was helping with  lights. We had to check evey plug, switch, lights. I couldn't belive how big the lamp can be. That's why singers are hot. When  concert had started and Tina cam out I forget about lights, just I was looking at her. fortunetly nothing had happend. Every-thing was O.K After  concert we were invited in backstage. then I could see her very, very clear. Just people who was helping and organizating this concert could meet her. Some of them were speaking with her, I wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm happy, that I could be thear. ",23
1," 16.12.00 Dear Jane Firstly I want to tell you that the idea of the ""International Arts Festival"" was a really great idea. I enjoyed the festival pretty much. However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange little details. I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival. This also would take more attraction to the festival. Another point which I think was ennoying, are the concert halls. The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so much people I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall. The plays and the films were really great. I enjoyed all of them. I hope to see much more films next year. The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it made a really big effect on the attraction,  that of course made the festival much more enjoyable. I again want to say that it was really nice to be at the festival. I believe that next year will be better if you consider my ideas. Your Sinccerly  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Andrew, I just received your letter and decided you to write back now; because of your questions which were about the rules. I'm really tired of the rules in school! Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that I'm going  is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearing has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example if you don't come to school  10 days in a year we fail that year. Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to. This is all that I can tell you about my school and family. Rules are every where and you can't change them. So just don't think about them. Your Best Pen friend ",32
1120," Dear Mr. Robertson! Thank you for giving us the chance to visit London. We all are exited about the programm you've prepared for us, especially about the visiting the National Art gallery. We have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show in a newspaper. We think it could be  great opportunity for us because we'll see the fashion show might shop for leisure and sports wear and all  girls in our class are intrested in new styles in make up and hairdressing. And it is free for students! If you don't mind, we'd like to change the programme a little bit. Instead of shopping on Tuesday afternoon we'd like to go to this show, which will continue till 7 o'clock in the evening. We all expect the trip to London to be exiting and hope to get unforgettable memories Best regards your students  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Our life is changing every day. New technological inventions bring us new cars, new planes, new houses. Future is almost unpredictable. But what if we'll try to imagine how our house will look like in the next 50 or 100 years? Will we all live in  countryside in house surrounded by forest full of animal life? Or would be our house itself alive? With new computer technology nothing is impossible. The scintist could invent the 4'th dimention and we'll get unlimited space inside the house. It is already predictable, that very soon all house appliances will be voice controlled. You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you'd like to wear, your hob will cook your preferable meals and your refigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food. Lots of changes could be done in the future, but the main purpose of the house - to keep comfort and safety, to place for you to relax and feel at home, - will remain. ",30
832," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter. I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I can go only on July because I'm a student. It's summer holiday during that time. I want to know if it is avaliabile during that time. First of all I would be pleased if the accommodation is in  log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent. It'll make me like at the village. I like painting, and once I won first prize in the university competition. I think I'll have  chance to draw the pictures, and I'll show  my friends who have never been there before. Another activities I would prefer is sailing. My father was a sailor when I was child. I was draged  to learn sailing. I'm good at it. It would be exciting. Fathermore I would like to ask you which kind  clothes I need to take and how much money I'll spend. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Recently we have a class discussion about shopping. All of the students agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable. Women always enjoy shopping. But a lot of incovenients anoy them. So they said they do not always enjoy shopping. First of all the car parking is not convinent and  expensive. Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car. Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher place then walk to the supermarket. Futhermore when you look aroud the supermarket, you can't easyly find the goods which you want to buy. It's very confusing without  right singho. Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.  Otherwise men always don't like shopping, while their wives are doing  shopping they sit in the car or read  newspaper. They would be happy if there are sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket. They'll change their mind. Instead of hating shopping they will enjoying shopping. In my opinion nowadays shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24
281," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW'. There were some unfortunate incidents. To begin with, according to your advertisement, discount tickets were availabe. However, I could not get them. So I could  get a good seat. In addition to this, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. As a result, I could not visit the restaurant since it had already closed when the show finished. To make matters worse, it was the different actor although Danny Brook should have starred. I was really looking forward to seeing his role, but on starting the show, I found it disappointed. Can you imagine how upset I was? Finally, I would like to ask you to give some money back to me. I look forward to receiving your satisfactory reply by return of post. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life greatly. To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box. When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it with the phone. On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb my time, the phone annoys me. Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention. With  internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad. Since I bought a computer, I have been checking  E-mails from my friend almost every day. Finding them, I feel happy even if there is only one. On balance then, I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it improves too rapidly  to catch up. ",39
1034," Dear Mr Robertson Our class is looking forward to going to London next week. The programme which you've organised we find very interesting especially the river trip to Greenwich. Thank you very much for it. There is only one thing that we'd like to change, if you wouldn't mind. We've read an advertisement about  London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday, March 14 from 10 oo to 19 oo. The latest fashions will be shown there and many useful tips about make-up and hairstyles will be given. According over programme we have a free time on Wednesday, March 15. So we'd like to go to a disco and this fashion show would be a great opportunity for us to learn something about styling. As we are from the small town we don't have any possibility to learn about this. We suggest to visit the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus. We think we'll find one free hour befor the River trip. It would be a good solution. We hope you are agree with us. Your class  [SEP]  In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention. They are always expected to be beautiful, intelligent, good-looking. This is very stressful. That's why it's very important for these people to have a private life without journalists where they can relax and where they don't need to be superstars. To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars or politicians have a right for it. Otherwise they can get soul problems,  fall in deep depressions. I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example all 24 hours in a day, and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is your friend, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with. On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen. I think we should have a little bit  respect for the famous people and let them some time for their private life. ",33
1208," June 12, 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, In replied of your letter, I will try to give you some advices. Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow. For the conference, I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important persons of others colleges. At the end of the conference, all students and leader will have a drink. To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk on the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful. I hope I give you enough details. I look forward to meeting you on the conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The building called in French ""Le Centre Pompidou"" is a very surprising monument. It's a modern building with an architecture that you can't see in  other place. What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building. On the Pompidou's center, there are different expositions on different themes. In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures. This expositions are often very attractive and they change every year. Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view on the city. So if you visit Paris, the Pompidou's center is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many others buildings. ",27
291," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW, and also about the servic. When I went to London, during my holiday, I decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW. During and also after the show lots of disappointing thing turned up. Firstly, it was not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove who acted, it was someone else. Sacondly, in your advertisement I read ""Times 14.30 and 19.30"". In fact the show started  20:15 Thirdly, I also read ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"", but the restaurant was closed because of painting. Last but not least, it also says ""discounts available"", but there was not any staff there who could do it. So I am sure that you will understand why I feel so frustrated and disappointed about the whole thing. I look farward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me the money back. Yours faithfully Maris Svensson  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I was reading when I suddenly hard a big bang. I looked out through the window and saw a big strange ""thing"". It looked like a floating potato, a brown potato. After that a being climed out from the potato. It looked at me and said. ""I am hear to help you. I only need to touch your teacher and you never need to do any homework again."" I could not belive my ears. It was the happiest moment of my life. I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my main-teacher walking through the door with the being after him. The being moved its hand farward and..... Then I felt a big pain in my head and heard ""You can't sleep in the lesson"". I looked up and saw my friend with the coursebook in her hand. Immediantely after I heard ""And don't forget your homework"". I looked at the book and read: ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets"" ",24
1008," Dear Pete, Many thanks for your letter which arrived must when I was thinking of you. I hope you and your family are feeling well. I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday. The only problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation. As you know I'm in Ferndown now spending  last minutes studying for exams. I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you. If not, pleas let me know. I'm sure we will find another solution. It's very kind of you to let me use things in your flat. I'm over the moon! Can I also ""take care"" of your computer and CD player and bicycle? Can you also let me know when you are going to come back on the 20th. Will it be or dinner time maybe? If yes, great! I will be able to see you. You know that helping you it's a real pleasure for me, you really don't have to become flat broke because of buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So  tiny ""Statue of Liberty"" will be nice. I will finish now as I have  mountain of work to do. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Take Care Yours,  [SEP]  ""junk food instead of a carrot"" Young man, are you aware of what you eat and drink? Are you sure that your diet is healthy enough to help you grow up? In today's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home, especially children, parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper. However, students who never have time for  healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or fibre usually finish on ""McDonalds"", hamburgers or Bic Macs. Moreover, very often  school canteen doesn't offer diversified  food like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal  and even if the times were worse, people were more sensible. In my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as they should work on their lifestyles and keep their head. ",34
252," BRASILIA (DF), JUNE 17th 2000 Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to express my disappointment with ""Over the rainbow"", the musical show which I watched last evening. First of all, according to the advertisement, one of the main actors would be DANNY BROOK who I love. Instead of this, I had to watch the performance of a different and unknown actor who wasn't so great as I expected. Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue more than it's necessary. I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressed and very expensive one, too. There wasn't  discount avaiable for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil. In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago. In conclusion, last night definitely was the worst experience about entertainment I've ever had in my life and that's why I ask you  my money back as a compensation. I'm looking forward to your reply faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship   and the ways  to comunicate to other people as well as our life expectancy. With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access  Internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from ourselves. Despite of the distances, we can keep our friendship closely and with a cheaply way. Besides of this, the information goes faster than it used to know and it's avaiable in the same time to every part of the world. On the one hand, our time is taken   to learn how to deal with the new technologies. On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us  support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things. For instance, we can research new manners of improving our quality of life. In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware about how they are introduced in our lives to avoid the dangerous side of the TECHNOLOGY.

840," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition. Here are some further information you need from me: I would like to travel in July. It is the only time of the year I have two weeks holiday. I would be grateful if you could give me a log cabin. It is more secure and there is no problem if it rains. As for the two activities, I would enjoy climbing and playing tennis. I have been climbing for more than 7 years. It should not be a problem. On the other hand, I have never played tennis in my life. But I watch every tournament on television. I like this sport very much. I would like to know if I need  special clothes, extra money or any other things. Could you please send me more details about that... I look forward to hearing from you. Charline Cholmondeley  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. There are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun. You often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress, the most beautiful shoes and so on... They are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to. This is very nice when you can do your shopping like that. The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have taken, you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again. Shopping is annoying but also necessary, it is why it is not always enjoyable. ",36
626," Dear Helen: Thank you for sending me this wonderful news. I was really happy when I knew I won the first prize. I am writing to give you my details and ask  some more information. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I need to stay at home in August. I am a college student and I am going to study in university this year. I will take my exams in June and have the result in August. So I shall stay to prepare for my university. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chance to be with other people, then I can make more friends. During the camp, I will do sing and climbing activities. I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with the others. I also like climbing because I like the view on the top of hills. Finaly, I want to know what the weather is like in California in July. Do I need some special clothes for the camp and how much money shall I bring for other expenses. I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours Sincerely.  [SEP]  To: The teacher of  English class From: Jolin Subject: The lessons  should be filmed Date: 13, June, 00 Instruction:  English class is going to make a short video about  school daily life. The aim of this report is to give the suggestion of which lessons and activities should be filmed. Lessons and Activities  Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students talk about some topics they choose and discuss  with others in order to prove their speaking and listening skills. Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up-dated. The teacher use video,  pictures to show students about festivals, sports, museums, ect. It is popular by the students. Canteen is the place students stay together apart from class. Quite a lot of students spend their free time there for relaxing and talking. Basketball is the most popular activity, whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week. Not only the students who have activity play but also a lot of students watch. Conclusion The lessons and activities above are the suggestion should be filmed. ",27
207," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show I went  last week. I spent a week's holiday in London and I had been looking forward to watching a wonderful show in your theatre. However, I was completely disappointed with that. Firstly, although I bought a ticket for 19:30 the show started at 20:15. It would never happen in my country I must say. Secondly, there was no discounts despite you showed it was available in your advertisement. Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on the strike. On top of everything, the main cast, Danny Brook, did not appear on the show. The actor who played instead of him was terrible. In fact, I expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffured. I trust you will give an immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory responce in return of post within a week. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  When we think about clothes in the future, we should think about the enviroment first. What will it be like in 2100? It is not pleasant to say the earth is now facing some serious problems. But it is the fact. Air-pollution might become more serious than now in the future and  destruction of  ozon-zone could not be stopped in 100 years. Considering these elements, we should wear clothes which can protect us from certain kind of sun rays and air pollution. I suppose they would be like a arm-suits. Of course, technologies will have developped enough  to invent new material for those kind of clothes. So we don't have to worry about how heavey they will be. We will feel as if we put on nothing. In conclusion, clothes after 100 years will not  as fashionable as they are now. We should consider wearing as in more practical way. ",28

First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four weeks vacation on July. I would like to travel on July.

Moreover, I am good at play basketball, in fact, I am the captain in  basketball team which is one of the best teenagers team in my city, and I also like singing. I play piano very well.

1019," Dear Mr Robertson, I was interested in an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I would really love to go to the show. I am writing to appriciate for the good programme. It was so kind of you to have organised the programme. I would enjoy to see the show, especially a fashion show. I am keen on wearing and drawing some clothes. This show starts on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition of London from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Especially, students are free! It will be  great opportunity for me. I feel that it is such a nice experience and worthy. I would like to suggest  idea and change  sightseeing by bus on Monday, because the English weather is so changeable.

I would like to recommend 'The Old Man and The Sea' because I've read it when I was teenager. It was such a wonderful story that I remember the old man speaking about human's life between the sea and the man. It may make him think of his future and this book could be very suitable for him.

649," Dear Helen Ryan I had received your letter, I am very happy to have won the first price. I would like to go in July after taking my examination at the college in the end of June. So it is impossible for me to go before. I would prefer to stay in a tent to  a cabin Because it is something I feel mores familia  I used to go camping with my family every summer. I am quite good at swimming. I won the first price at the Regional Championship six years ago. But I think I'd rather do other activities what you show me in your letter like tennis. I have been playing this game with my friends and I like it. I would be please if you  give me some more information about the accommodation, and some advices about the cloth (shal) I should wear and how much money I should take with me. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable,  even no healthy for your pockets. I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying cloths. Me for example, I don't particularly like shopping, when I go on my own, it can be bored. My sister loves shopping, she could stay trying clothes on all day in a shop. I am agree that the most of the people enjoy buying cloths, food, something for the house presents . Because  is something it goes with their culture. Sometime you can stay all day out just to buy a present for someone, it stard in the morning, and of course you have the breakfast somewhere, and it get later and you  still looking for it so you have the lunch, so finaly you spent more money than you thought  ",19

Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be  the second week of July because I will be very busy in any other date for reasons of work. Secondly I would prefer sleeping in  log cabins because I  fell much more comfortable. One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems in my back. Finally, the two activities I would like to do while I am camping are Singing and Basketball. The first one because I think I am good at it and also I love singing loudly with other people. The last one I have never tried it but I think I can do it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier. I would like to know if I must take some money and what kind of clothes I will need.

Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing. It was a wonderful experience but at the same time I had to work very hard. The things I did were: Prepearing and controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc. The most exciting thing was talking with the band, asking questions to them and of course listening  the music and enjoying the incredible show. It was the most exciting experience I've ever had in my life. Best wishes. ",29

The advertisement said that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor  was different. Who can believe it? You are really a funny theatre. And  the time too. You wrote that at 19.30 the musical started. I was waiting for 45 minute. the show started at 20:15. I paid 20 pounds without any discount. You said that some discouns was available. Nobody took a discount. When I went to the reastaure I was really suprised. It was closed and I steel don't know why? In the advertisemen you wrote ""your perfect evening out"", that's very funny. It was Just a disappointing night and I want you to return to me some of my money, a very angry man  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways. The modern technology help me when I do my homework,  to  some games e.t.c. First of all the computer. It helps me when I studie.

I can go from one place to  other very fast Most of the machines which you have at home help me, too. I can find cold water in the refrigarator but 50 years before the didn't have the refrigarator, so our life is easier, today. When I stay home I can watch  or listen to the radio e.t.c. so the modern technology help me to spend my free time. As you have seen the modern technology has changed my daily life a lot and I believe that it has changed it to the better. ",25
306," Dear Sir, I am writing with reference to an arrangement I made for your theatre show last week. I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't in the scene. Beside this, I had to wait three quarters of  hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was no nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available, so, it was an expensive evening! I know you will understand my frustration and that's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. However, she was a close friend and I couldn't accuse her of nothing else. I won't never forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth of my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to face it at that moment but... I bursted into teas as well as my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely step by step. I got conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell it to Pat. I still remember her words: ""Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed"". I do really trusted her when three days after I went to school and I could appreciate I was catching the eyes of everybody. I couldn't stand being watched and my furious led me straight to Pat. She tried to apologise but it wasn't enough for me. My best friend had let me down. From that moment, I denied being with anyone until I met Cold, a sensitive dog, the one who would keep my secrets forever and would be near me until the end. Sure! ",29
1131," Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for  good programme which provides us  3 days stay in London.  It contains a wide range of activities for example, sightseeing,  river trip, visiting  science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admit for free. All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up, so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like. It would be grateful if you give a little change in  programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many times on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an off the light.  Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary. From my point of view, people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. Computer might know better than  human, but there are many things which it can not replace in our life. ",32
944," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to provide you with the information you require. First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year  is very hot and I prefer going on summer to going on winter or during  other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter  would be impossible to do. Secondly, I would rather be accomodationed in  log cabins than go in  tens. In my opinion staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner. Thirsthly, I would prefer to swimming and playing tennis, because I have been practising them since I was I child, and I think I  very good in each other. Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or  everything is provided for the organisers. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not writing  you before, but I have been so busy, because last weak I went to a pop concert to help the singers. First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they are made-up. There, in the room I had to helped them, I mean the singers, to put on theirs clothes, and I had to  make-up  them. A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage. While they were singing a man told me to clean the room, where the singers get dressed. Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes. Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished. What I really liked doing was to helped them with their clothes and to make-up them, because I learnt how to  make-up a person and I spend a few minutes with the most popular grup of the world. Write  me soon. Love, ",21
3," Dec. 16th, 2000 Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory. First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it. Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition. They were cold and moist, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficient. Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all  events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided. Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dec 16th, 2000 Dear Mary, I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here. Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected. Another thing  different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period. Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m. I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still ones coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules. Take care! ",38
647," Dear Ryan I am writing to reply for your letter about  competition. First of all I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition. Secondly you asked me, when I have time for travel, so I can go only in July, because only in July I have holiday. And I would like to go in the first part of this month,  socond part I spend with my familly. If you do not mind I would prefer  tent, because in  tent I will be along. While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing, because it is my favorite sport. I am good at it - I am sailing from childhood. The second activities which I would like to do is surfing - I have never do it. I would like to know, how much money I must have with me? And what clothes I should take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faitfully Aniela Chmielewski  [SEP]  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" 'This is such a marvellous book you will want to read it again' In my opininion this book 'The Old Man and the sea' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway had writen. Thise book is about  men who know that he will die soon, he know that he didn't made his dream coom tru. So he decidet to go for  last trip in his life. Hes destenation is get  Marlin. He is very old, and he isn't so strong that he should be. He need to rest, but he don't geve up. I the end he make his drems coom tru, he get  vast Marlin. In thise book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it can be deficult and take  long time but we can do it. We must believe in our selfs. People in our ages should think about this. Sometimes they geve up, befor they get something,  To sum up I must say that every-one should read this book. ",23
422," Dear Sir or Madam, Ref: Over the rainbow musical show. I am writing to you to mention some problems about the musical show shown in your theatre. First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show, it wasn't. Because I'm big fan of them, if was pretty much boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing. It didn't start at 19:30 and there was a delay for 45 minutes which was quite a long time and everyone got frustrated. The tickets also caused a problem. Discounts weren't available at all. Moreover the testament was till under the construction so that we couldn't use it when we were extlemely hungry. Finally, I wonder why you didn't ask for the money back if you have guaranteed the perfect evening. I am therefore writing to you to ask for the money back as I didn't get any advantages or services from you. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, L. P. Lou  [SEP]  Technology has been developed extremely fast these days and as it is still going on, it can't help affecting our lives. One of the biggist thing  has changed is a change in a method of communications. People have invented such things like TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us enable to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily. There are also changes in biological areas. Nearly almost of the disease have been found the way to cure except only a few like AIDS. It helped us to live longer and make us stronger against them. I have mentioned  few changes above but there's still a biggist one left which is about computer areas. It helped us to be able to work much more quicker and accurately than before with the help of  Internet. Basically modern technology has changed our life more comfortably but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship, togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for  whole day. But we still have to admit that we can't live without them even  they give us some disadvantages. ",24
49," Dear Ms clark: I am writing to give suggestion for the international art festival, which I have been to one weeks before. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year. Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it is very interesting, especially for the young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time  very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world  on the advertisement, but in fact they are from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls are too small, could you consider making them bigger next year. The plays and films were really wonderful, people liked them very much, so could you play more next year The last thing is about the ticket. It was excellent about one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this. I hope that you can consider my suggestions. I really look forward to going to the festival next year. Yours sincerely:  [SEP]  Dear Jacob: I'm very glad to hear from you. I hope everything is ok. I'm really sorry I didn't write you back immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you. In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet during the lessons, we should go there in the brake. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt, I don't like it. If I can, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success at once, we should give them  second chance to try. Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home,  just don't take trouble to my family, that's all. OK, just here. I look forward to hearing from you soon. All the best wishes and good luck. yours: ",28
238," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you after visiting your theatre. Frankly speaking, I was very disappointed after my visit. I was displeased from the very beginning, because I expected to get a discount as I'm a student. According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all. But nevertheless I decided to go to your show. The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30. I had to wait in  overcrowded hall. When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor. One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook's participance. So, you could understand how disappointed I was. To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed. So I hadn't such  perfect evening, as was promised in your advertisment. In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? In my opinion, modern technologies play the important role in people's life. I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies. Both computer and  Internet influence people's life. I have to use  computer every day. It helps me in preparing my homeworks. Firs of all  Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information. On the one hand  Internet is often used for entertaiment, but on the other hand it's also used in different business and education process! With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me  chance to improve my English. From my point of view,  Internet can be used in education, because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers. Though  Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it. ",27
1221,"  Mrs Smith, I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the Conference. I hope I can answer your questions. At First, this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education. In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can go by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station. The Conference will happen in the Hotel, which is so much easier. The Conference, not being modest, it is a quite well organized. It will starts at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students. I am very happy that you want to know  my area, although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough. However, if you want, you can call me and I can show you some interesting places. I will be very glad. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Affecting Our Lifes Cars, boats, motobikes, airplanes: Who did never use this once? This is a good question. The humans seems always that they are running and the fastest of this inventions is certainly, the airplane. At First, when Santos Dummont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think how the people could transform his creation. In this world, where the nations fight to be the better one couldn't be diferent: the airplane became the most important thing in the war. Unfortunately, it was used to kill a lot of people. However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities. How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definetely, by air. After this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us. So, the airplane is definitely an important invention, because it have changed people's life in wars. Until now, it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world. Let's congratulate Santos Dummont! ",25
565," 13/06/00 Dear Helen Ryan I am really pleased to hear from you  I won first prize in the competition. It is the thing I really want. How I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter. First, I am afraid but I can travel only in July. I've got  three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August. I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee. So July is the only month I can take part in your activities. Second, regarding accomodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer. And I love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely nature in California for me to draw on my canvas. Let me ask a question about clothes and money. What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take. I am really looking forward to going there and  your reply. Yours faithfully Yun Sandra  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable. For example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually  traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment. However, people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service. For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them. Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping. Otherwise they can have lots of problem and  difficult to live. ",27
757," 13 June. 2000 Dear Ryan, I am so marvellous about winning the competition. I am answering what you would like to know some information from me. At first, I am able to travel only in July because I will have on holiday in July, furthermore I have a important exam in November. Secondly I would prefer to stay in  tent as it will be natural life while I am at the Camp. Thirdly I  keen on playing tennis and taking some photography. In spite of the fact that the weathe is bad, I play tennis. I collect strange photography by myself. Finally I am wondering that how much money I need for myself and what kind of clothes I need. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Bae Ki Seul  [SEP]  Title: Speaking activity I like speaking activity while I am in the class. During that time I can talk  some secret things or private with class-mates. After that we know each other more than before. In addition speaking activity include everything  to learn English such as listening, speaking,  grammer as well. Other lesson, the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammer, English culture... etc. It might be good. However all  students are passive. So it can be boring. give a topic and then discussion about it. I know that what my friends think and like. It is real life who we are. Also the film must be funny. If a film is boring, nobody will see it. During speaking, there are lots of  happening such as, some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture. Having fun and knowing new knowledge. It makes us laugh. So I think that speaking activity should be filmed as you can see and know  real us and  funny as well. ",18
522," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London for a holiday, I went to the Circle Theatre to see OVER THE RAINBOW in the evening. That made me feel disappointed. First of all, the actor was different from  your advertisement. I meant he was not Danny Brook. Secondly, it took times to wait about forty five minutes, because it started at 20:15. It should be on time at 19:30. Then it had no discounts, which the advertisement said so. Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount from your ticket  with  ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant was early closed. As soon as the show ended, I went to there for having a dessert. Lastly, I don't think that it was my perfect evening. I would like to get my money back. I look forward to replying from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Griffin, who is a teacher, wasn't surprised at our preparation. It was so close to be on his birthday, so we made a decision to hold a small party for him. She has just learnt with us for three weeks. She is not talkative,  kind, and reserved. However,  this party she took part in, she was responsible for preparing food. As far as we knew, she's good at cooking. While she was choosing vegetables in a market, she came across him. When he asked her 'why do you choose deliberately?', she answered without thinking. That caused the secret  disclosed. We didn't blame her, because we knew that she didn't intend to do like that. Although he wasn't surprised, he was glad and pleased with our party. Anyway, Happy Birthday to Griffin, again. ",23
929," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part of ""Camp California in the USA"". I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July. I am finishing my study in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job. I would prefer to live in a tent during your camp. I have always dreamt about sleeping in a tent, in sleeping bags, but my parent always took me to expensive hotels, so it would be a nice adventure for me. During the camp I would like to pratise my swimming (I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years) and also I would like to learn how to do some good photos. (I have no experience!) I would be really glad if you could tell me something about clothes I should bring with me. (Do I need any special garments?) and could you tell me please, if I need some extra money to pay for anything like trips or photo-paper. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping could be fun! Sometimes I like doing it during long Sundays. I like going between colourful shelfs and picking some nice things for dinner or for decorating our house with. I love talking with my mum during shopping, meeting new people or old friends. Sometimes unfortunatelly shopping could be very annoying, especially at Christmast or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usually. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!) At Christmas or Easter time all shops have usually an unpleasant smell (because of the crowd) and are very noisy! Another period when I don't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then! You cannot breath, you cannot see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper! Next,  not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to. You just cannot refuse buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it. In my opinion, shopping could be really enjoyable! The only advice would be: ""Do not do your shopping at Christmast or Easter time"" - but it will not make any sense, will it? So you just have to get used to it, and enjoy your shopping for the rest time of the year! ",36
335," Dear Sir/Madam My name is Alida Fanetti, and I'm writing  you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently. One evening, while I was walking around the city I saw a very interesting advertisement, which was about a musical show. I'm a fun of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the show. The tickets were a little expensive but I was with other TEN people, so when we read ""Discounts Available"" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for group of numerous people. It wasn't true; there weren't any discounts. The show started at 20.15 and not at 19.30 so we waiting for  long time. Before the show started, a man said that there wasn't Danny Brook because he was ill. It was a disaster. After the show, which wasn't as good as we expected, we decided to go to the theatre restaurant. It was closed because people in the kitchen weren't ready with the food. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and I, would be gratefull if you will give us some money back, if it is possible. I hope to receive an answer. Your faightfully  [SEP]  ""the old man and the sea"" BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY Dear Sandro, I'm Alida, how are you? I'm writing  you because I have an important thing to tell you. I read in the newspaper that in the next  days some book of short stories are going to be read on the radio. A few days ago you told me that you have to read ""the old man and the sea"" by Hemingway for school; well, on friday  is going to be read, on the frequency 96.7, this book. I suggest you to listen to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading for you. I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's a possibility for ""busy people"" to know important and beautiful short stories and books. Well, I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book. I read it two months ago and I liked it very much. It's a sad story but it makes you know  a tipe of life that you can't imagine that really exists. The old man is a sad person but he loves his live and lives on the beach because he can't stay without see the sea for a day. I think you will enjoy it. Now I have to stop writing but I'll write you more letters. I hope you will listen to this book on the radio. Write me back soon and tell me about your impression   (I mean if you enjoyed the story or not!) Love P.S. Remember 96.7 on friday at 15.30 p.m. ",25
582," . I would like to travel only  July because I would be in schools holydays  and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip which is boring?! And when the sun is shining you are relax and you feel good. . I would prefer  tents to sleep  at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents  to compare   in a house. You are in communication with the nature and you can hear the insects. And we only need to sleep and not to cook or watch T.V... It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable. . From the list below, the two activities I will choose are Tennis and sailing. Tennis because I play Tennis and I am classed 15-5. I like very much Tennis because it is a technical and physical sport. And you need  strategie to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside in the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind,  the ball becomes incontrolable!  Windsurfing because I pratise it for a long time. You can do it alone. I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and slide like skiing, surfing. you need technics to move the windsurf. You must know how to use the wind and you have great sensations! I would like to ask you questions: Must I take with me my clothes? Is there a washing machine at Camp California? Do I need some money to pay  the meals!  [SEP]  you have recently had a class discussion about shopping. Now your english teacher has asked you to write a composition, giving your opinions on : ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" In fact, shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you don't have enough money! You don't find anything interesting in the shop. You can hesitate  to choose an article. Which is the best article to take? The seller can be not very nice and watch you all the time. You don't find your size or the good color in the article. The article can be too expensive. It looks fragil and it could break easily. Your must test several shops and compare the price, the quality of the articles. So you must walk all the day or go by car. And the weather must be fine if you walk in the town. Shopping is not always enjoyable if there is a lot of people in the shops because you can't move and choose the article and be cool! ",28
704," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for  letter which I received last week. I was delighted to heard that I won the prize for two week at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would be able to travel in the first week of July 2000, because my college will finished on 28 June 2000. I needed 1 - week to prepare all I needed to take with me, It said that about accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents to log cabins. Staying in tents  more interesting than in log cabins and I always dream of sleeping in tents so my dream  coming true! I  always interested in sport, so I am very happy to do sport activity particularly Basketball and tennis. When I was at secondary school I used to play for a school team and I am very good at them. The last reason  I love to watch basketball and my favourite team was Chicago also my favourite player was Michael Jordan! I would like to know more information about clothes and money. Do I need to take a special clothes such as, warn clothes, jumper. Finally, How much money to I need to take with me? Is there any cash machines nearest where we  staying? It would be very grateful for you  to give me more details as soon as possible. I  looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely, Alak Liyana  [SEP]  Dear, Kim, How are you? I haven't heard from you for such a long time. I hope everything is alright with you. Sorry! I haven't written to you since  last two months, because I have been very busy to helped and organizing the pop concert which took place near my town. Let me tell you more about what I have done last month. I have had a wonderful experienced with helping  pop concert last month. My duty was helped them cooking for all of them during the concert, as you know I'm very good at cook and everybody loved my good I cooked! Secondly, I helped them to prepared the clothes and the custom during the concert, although I never experience about clothes and art before, but I enjoyed it very much. What I liked most about my experienced from the concert was a great atmosphere behind the state and  live music  made me felt great and happy, what's more, I have  opportunity to meet a singer who I loved and I dream about. He also gave me his adress and telephone number if I need help from him in the future. I'll show you when you come around to see me. Anyway, I'd better go now. I have some homework that needs to be done. Write to me soon when you have time. Give my regards to our parents. Take care! Best wishes, ",27
1082," Dear Mr Robertson, With reference to our trip in London, in name of all of us,  English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special atention in have organised a good programme to know  interesting and cultural points in London. We have been very excited about this and coincidentely we have found another option to add in our programme, certainly if your agree with . We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions, Leisure, sports and style of life. However  your decision in changing a little bit our programme, we would suggest just on Tuesday afternoon no doing shop,  everything else could stay the same. We are really satisfied in  sightseeing by bus,  in go to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion  and  will be free. We are looking forward to your answer. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  I knew, I could die. It was dangerous, but I kew I had to do it. This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998,  it wasn't 13th even it look liked , but it was my 25th birthday. Everything was going so bad and I knew, I could die. Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in  dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, in my 25th birthday. I was at home making me up before to go to a restaurant with my friends and, sudenlly, he rang the bell, he was so nervous with a gun in his hands and no longer I could speak he took me out with him. I had tried to think in stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scared me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques. I didn't want ,  I've never approve  his deal with the drug, but I couldn't do it different. The dangerous man who we'd gone to buy drugs  was upset with my brother and had decided to kill him, but I had killed him first. If I didn't do it, I knew I would die, my option was my life, but now I haven't any chance to live because I'm in the prison. ",22
1073," Dear Mr. Robertson I am a student from your class and I would like to thank you first of all. It's a good programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show. That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00. They show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear ands something for the women: make up and hairstyle trends. That show is free for students, so it's also a big advantage. We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing. I know that it is a change. But I have thought about it. On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich. Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime. I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge, as well. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Who would like to be famous? Are you dreaming of being a Star? It must be wonderful when you have a lot of money and everybody seems to know you. Really? I think the main problem is that you would lose your private life. That's the price you have to pay nowadays. But you need all the journalists to become famous so the only way is to accept that there are journalists and that they are just doing their job. No one told you to be famous. If you are famous it was your choice and therefore  is a price  to pay. Of course you have fame and poverty. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on the street. To sum up I think, if you  well-known you have to deal with that. There's no other way. Everone knows you because of the journalists so  can't just ignore them, can you? ",30
57," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing in response to your advertisment in Today's newspaper. I recently spent two days at the International arts festival and I found it very entertaining. It was really a good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows. The idea that I prefered the most was to suggest a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student or unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money. I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, he concert hall was too small. Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries. A friend of mine went to see the play ""Hamlet"" and the film ""Gladiators"". He told me how great it was and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year. In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in  sommer. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Two sisters, Alex and Daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found any present for their mother. Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and  only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister. After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold. In deep of herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it. Unfortuneatly, Daniela fainted. She was so cold that she couldn't move her legs. Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angle appeared. He asked Alex if it was more important to bring back a present at home or to save her sister. The answer was obvious and the angel saved Daniela.. This story happend a long time ago. ",35
293," Sir manager Yesterday I went to ""The Circle Theatre"" to see the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". I'm very disappointed of this evening. The first thing was, that it started 45 minutes late. And when it finaly started, there wasn't Danny Brook who plaied. There was a different actor and he was really bad. You should have informed us before that you've changed the actor. On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't. After the show I wanted to drink somthing in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started to late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday. So I ask you sincearly for my money back becaus it wasn't a perfect evening out.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her that my parents are getting divorsed and that I will move to Chicago with my mother. We are together in High School in California and this is our last year. We wanted to study biology here in Los Angeles with some other friends but now my plans have changed and I have to leave them. One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me, if I will give a party befor I'll go. I had to tell her that I don't have the time to organise anything becaus we, my mother and I, have to get our stuff ready to move. She wasn't very surprised and soon I've forgotten her question. The year was getting to the end. On Monday in our last week Pat asked me if I want to eat supper at her house. I thought it was a good idea and we went home. But when we get into the hous ther were all my friends! We had a great evening becaus Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! ",25
782," Dear Helen Ryan In response to your letter that I received last Saturday I am writting to answer your questions. I am very happy that I won this competition. I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday. My holidays will finish in the begining of September and  will be good to travel during this time. (August-September). The accommodation I would prefer to stay in   tents because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with the nature. For the time that I will spend there I would like to chose more the two activities but I know  is not possible so I chose swimming and singing. I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love  when I sing and about swimming I was champion last year in my city. So, I am quite good. I would like to ask you some questions like which kind of clothes  I have to go with ? Will I need to go with how much money? Is necessery tablets (for headach, insects)? Can I go with a friend? Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Introduction This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed in our daily life at school. Why to film the school? Firstly we should film our school to show how important it is for our growing. Secondly, parts of our life like breaks, lunch time, spending time with friends will be good to make the video interesting. Suggesting places to film. A good place to be filmed is our Geography class. The students in this class have lots of freedom to speak and we can travel around the world in one hour and fifteen minutes. Is wonderfull how the tecnology make things so easy. Also we should film our sports class because with this we will show how important  is to be healthy nowadays. Conclusion To conclude we could film our teachers life too. Will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if are not them we will never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidents and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.

1146," Dear Ms. Belinda Marriott, My name is Akihiro and I'm a member of an English club at West Isle College. I'm writing this letter to invite you to the event which I'm organizing for people who want to improve their English, as our teacher told me that you have come to live in our area. Our English club is not a very big one, with 14 students and a teacher. Most of the students are between 18 and 22 years old, but there are some elder , the eldest is 28 years old. We all love to learn English. At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech. You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice. I'm planning the event on 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you. After the event, I'd like to offer you a dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  I had never taken birthdays serious, both my own and  of others, until I had that really special day on my twenty-fourth birthday. I was born in May, which is the busiest month for school teachers in Japan. Unfortunately, both of my parents are teachers. In my childhood, they were always too busy to remember my birthday and I didn't remember my birthday either. When I was 23, I joined a NGO in Denmark and stared living with other members, most of who are from Europe. On that day, I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday. I had never had a birthday party before and I didn't expect much. The party was far beyound my expectation. 20 people from five different countries celebrated for me. I had never felt happier. I still often forget my birthday, but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago.  ",36
420," Dear Mr. (...), My name is ... Two weeks ago my family and I visited London. During our stay we saw a bright advertisement of your theatre and decided to see this newest and best musical show (as it was said in you advertisement). Actually. I must say that  our perfect evening wasn't out! In your ad  was said that in  main roles  would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny wasn't there! Instead there was a different actor whose play was disappointing. The show had to begin at 19.30, but indeed it started at 20.15 and we had to wait for 45 minutes in a great noise. Some words about  tickets: you ad noticed that discounts were available so we didn't have  money with us. When we came the administration of the theatre said that discounts are not available. Finally, when we decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show it was closed (all the staff went home because the show lasted 45 minutes longer). For all these reasons I would like you to give me at least half of my money back. With hope for a mutual agreement, Mrs. (...).  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was May, 15 - our english teacher's birthday. Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to make a surprise for her. Month ago we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it in a secret. We have been discussing for a long time what to present her. There were a lot of proposals from the students: one proposed a vase, another - a good pen (he said it would be useful for the teacher). But we decided to buy a picture, because she has always told us about art galleries with a great exitement. We have chosen the best one with a beautiful nature  in it. We also decided to arrange a party on her birthday (and it had to be a surprise too). A day before her birthday we had an English lesson, and after the lesson Pat came up to Marion and told her about our surprise. He was bad-tempered and envious and he didn't want everything to be all right, and besides he didn't like Marion. That's why he disappointed Marion and us. ",26
431," Mr. Manager: I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time. Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight I had waitted for fourthey five minutes. Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show. It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too. Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered. And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give  it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I couldn't get my money back.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat. She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good. She said that she wouldn't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute ever second. But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad. I just knew I couldn't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for  meal I was in a schock thinking why isn't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat  for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry. I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and  can't keep any secrets. ",22
489," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you about the differences between the advertisment and the real show. I am also expecting to get some money back. First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason of the delay and excuse about it. If there was someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something. Then, as we were told that the show was begginning, the second shock of the evening faced us. Instead of the famous actor Danny Brook, a very bad and disappointing actor showed up. Watching the show plus the 45 minutes of delay made us hungry of course so we decided to eat at the theatre restaurant. As it was too late, the restaurant was closed and we starved till we got to our homes. We were also disappointed because there were no discounts! (As I mentioned above) I was very disappointed and I am asking for some money back if possible.  [SEP]  PAT AND SECRETS .... Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Knowing that he decided to not to see Alison until the birthday party. Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles. The best bakery was at the other side of the town so there was no danger for him to see Alison and reveal the party. He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery. On his way he saw lots of places he could buy the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which is as  andy as Alison's house he kept on riding. When he reached the bakery, he was quite relieved and he almost forgot that he had a secret to keep.  Picking the best cake he was preparing to go back. He suddenly saw Alison and said ""Did you like the cake, it's for your birthday party"". After the conversation was over Pat still wasn't aware of what he had done, and he didn't find out till the party took place. ",32
632," Dear Mrs Ryan! I'm very happy that I won first prize in your competion. Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing about I dreamed a lot. You asked me few questions in your letter. I would like to answer. The only one term for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA on July becouse on August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights in hol. on July are hot. Tent will be more cooler to sleep  then the cabin. You offer a great veriety of activities. My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball. I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer. Basketball is the game which I love. I always watch the NBA matches on T.V. It will be great for me to train basketball in  USA. I have qustions to. How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are requested Thank You. Yours sincerely K.  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops. We could only buy things from Russia. People alwas queued for stuff from  west. If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night. It was the worst side of shopping in Poland  couple  years ago. Nowadays we have capitalism, free market lots of privete shops, markets and super-markets. We can buy everything what about we imagine. Polish super market are not Polish origin shops. They are imported from enother Western Europe country. I apprieciate this shops for lots of products, cheep prices end big spaces. But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread. On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are crowded. They are filled by people who went buy everything. I do not like crowded places. This is the reason why I do not like shopping. ",27
160," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre. I recently went there to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true. For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and  a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning. All these problems spoiled my evening and frustrated me, since I was expecting to see a good play, so I expect a full refund. By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as it was said in the advertisement? I look forward to hearing from you and having my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The New Modern Life Modern technology and science have changed my life in many ways. The easy access to information and the new ways of communicating with other people help me save time that I can spend doing whatever I want to. Of all the recent technological advances, the one that had the great impact on my life was the Internet. It provides you  all the information you want. I don't watch the news on television anymore, because I can use my computer to read only the things that interest me. Mobile phones are another thing that is making my life much easier. They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are. This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution. All these things save me lots of time. I get to rest more and spend more time at home, and so they make me a happier person. For the next  years, we can expect many more technologies that will continue making our lives easier. ",33
249," Dear Sir/Madam, I have just returned from my holiday in London. During my stay I went to see a musical show in the Circle Theatre and I have  very disappointing evening. Firstly I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw diffrent actors. What is more you advertize there were discounts available but it were not. You said that the musicial show started at 19.30 but recently it began at 20.15. I was very bored because I did not have anything to do when I was waiting for your show. Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why. You promised us a big show and  perfect evening but it was only an average show with unknown actors. In my opinion you are not very respectful and responsible. I will never trust you again. I would like you give me my money back as soon as possible. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As I remember I have known her for ever. She had always been my best friend and I had said her everything. We lived in the same street and the weekends we spent together. When I had 16 years old I fell in love with the most hundsom boy in our school. Paul was older than me and he was playing basketball. Only Pat knew about my lover. One day he invited us for his party. I was very happy and nervous. Everything was great. But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me. Everybody started to laught at me. I was angry and I run away to the forest. 'She was my best friend, how can she do it to me' - - I was crying. When I was walking through the forest I saw a very tall man who was staying in front of me. 'My name is Jon' - he whispered - 'Don't be afraid'. We started to talk. This alien was so intelligent and funny that I forgot about my troubles. We talked for all night and I fall in love with him. We met again and again and now Jon is my husband. Maybe it was good that Pat was so talkative. ",27
968," Dear Sir/Madam, I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised  it. It was  absolutely fantastic prize. I am writting  you about your questions. First, I can come there only  July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new turm will also start in September. I would like to stay at long cabins because I have stayed at tents many times in my childhood. The most exciting offer is your activities. I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing. My grand father used to do it when he was a student. After he has got a job, he became busy. However, he retired  his job last year so he has had his own time. If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my grand father. I would like to ask about my clothes and money. How much do I need to bring them? I wish I could see you soon. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? You want to know about my experience at a pop concert, don't you? It was so exciting! My main working was take people to their seat because of a concert hall, which was the millenium dorm. Do you know it? It's the hottest place in England. Most of  people were first time to come there, so they're lost. I had also never been there before. It's a huge building. I also sold a panfulet of that concert, CD and T-shirts. The most exciting experience was that I could met a lot of people. I told you before that concert was performed by Elton John, so there were a lot of famouse people. When I saw Jullia Roberts, I was socked. She was abusolutelly beautiful. I have never seen that kind of long legs in my life! Did you enjoy my letter? I can't explain  you very well. Anyway, it was a wonderful time. lots of love, ",26

I will be happy to be for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.

To answer your questions, I would like to tell you, what my travel can be possible only on July, because I will have the Cambrigge exam till 1 July. Would it be possible to have accomodation at Camp California in a tent, because I didn't have  chance to sleep into it. And would it be possible to do swimm and surf. I am very good  swimming.

Shopping can't be enjoyable if you don't have money to spend. It is better to stay at home and read a good book. I'm thinking do shopping in the big spaise like Harrodss it's not  plesure. Because it's crowding of people. I'd like to be in small boutiques, and I would rather go to shopping along and during the weekand time. Because I don't like to give some advise it's can be willy boring. And go to shopping at the end of  weekand it's not for me. I don't know what I can tell you more? I'm sorry.

42," Dear Ms. , I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed  the exhibitions of the festival that you had organized. Furthermore, it's  worthful experience for people  to know  the other countries' arts. But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival. Firstly, it is better to invite more artists not only from six countries. For example, the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere. Secondly, some concert halls were too small to enter all of the audience. Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time. I would prefer to be held more performances next year in the bigger halls. Finally, regards to tickets, it is  very wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people. You may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Long long time ago, there were the old man and old woman  lived in a foot of  mountain. One day, when the old man went into the bambo bush, he found one bambo gritted white. He had never seen such bambo before but decided to cut it down. Then there was a lovely baby in it. He was surprised but was pleased because he had no child. He took the baby to his house and explained what had happened in the bush to the old woman. The old woman was glad to have a baby and they decided to bring up the baby. The baby was named 'Kaguya.' She grew very quick and was so beautiful. A lot of men asked her to marry with them but she always refused. One full moon night she said to her parents sadly, 'I have to return to the Moon tonight.' The old man and woman tried to keep her staying  their house, but they couldn't. The servants from the Moon picked her up to the Moon. She gone away. She was the princess of the Moon. This story happened a long time ago. ",23
177," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complain about your theatre and the musical show ,,Over the rainbow"". Firstly, in your advertisement  was said that Danny Brook has a part in the show, but there was a different actor in the play. This fact disappointed me a lot. Secondly, there was written in the advertisement, that the show begins at 19.30, however, it started at 20.15. According to the advertisement, discounts should be available, but, in fact, I was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way. It was very uncamfortable for me. In addition to this, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late (the show did not start on time). Everybody, who came to it's doors, had to go to the other restaurant in  bad mood. I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting. Furthermore, I would like you to return my money. You promised me  perfect evening out, but it was one of the most terrible in my life. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was  25-years-old secretary in one big company. Her boss was  rich man, really rich. His name was Timson White. He was one of the most famous person in his city, but he wasn't honest with his clients. Pat had worked for him for two years. Certainly she knew a lot of secrets. One of them was about her boss' private life: he had got  illegal son. Timson's wife, who was good looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He even couldn't say a word. He tried to make up who could give his wife knows. Of course, only one person had known this except his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check it up. Next day he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed  new secretary. It was the worst weekends in a last few years. On the other hand, now everything is o.k. Timson has a good close family, his son lives with them, his company makes a good profit... Only Pat has problems, she should earn her living in other company again! ",26
46," Dear Jane Clark, The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you for the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there must be some improvements to make this festival better. Firstly, there were stars and artists only from six countries. This number may be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concerts holls were too small for this much people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you are very successful about finding good stars. The films and plays were not so many. As a result of this the kinds of films were not enough. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say with the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted any kind of people. Another paht is the tickets. The weekend ticket is excellent because it is not so expensive and it allows  to see everything. But I was disappointed that there were no competition between the films performed I think there should be an Oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films.  [SEP]  Dear Elinor, I'm so glad to receive your lost letter because I've started to think that you were angry about me for not writing for a long time. I promise I'll write more The school rules are horrible here. We are restricted  to do nearly everything. The school is like a dungeen here. I don't went to be so evel about school but the rules are rules and they are limiting us with the borders of our school. We must wear the uniform-like clothes all the day and  week They don't even let us to wear different sweaters - etc other than dark blue. It is boring. We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase the teachers think that we are chatting. How poor their imagination are!! However we are free at home. You could do anything you like as long as you have good grades. If you don't, you hear the same word every day, ""Study, Study, Study""! Nobody likes to study but we have to. You can't imagine how happy I am and I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon Love, ",30
410," 17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing . I was to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'. There I was  many problems. first of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up  to wait. The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different . They were worst than the previst actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious in spite of that. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am absolutely annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give  back  money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope  your answer soon. Finally, I want to say you this is the last time which I come to your theatre. Thank you. Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE I am going to write about what clothes will be worn in the future. I have gone out to the street and I have asked to people for this question. I have recollected all  answers and I have made this article. Most of people think that character people and clothes are together. They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amused, etc. I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon, very exciting. And people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will be more enjoyable than people  now because they will have many things to do. On the other hand, most of people in the future will wear glasses. It is because sunlight is very bad. At the end all people will be short-sight. In conclusion, I would like living in the future to check which clothes exactly they will wear. It is a point very interesting.  ",23
270," London 17 June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I recently had a week's holiday in London, so I went to the theatre to see a musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at 'The Circle Theatre', where you are the manager. I had a terrible evening, so there were a lot of faults in the event of last Saturday: The first point, the show started at 20:15 (it was too late). The second point, the principal actor was changed. The third point was that the discounts tickets were unavailable and finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because the oven was broken and we couldn't enjoy  there after the musical show. I would be grateful if you could send a money back because it was a horrible evening for my family and it wasn't a perfect evening out. I hope to have news about you as soon as possible Yours faithfully, JUAN SAN SEBASTIAN  [SEP]  The science and technology have changed my life every day. The modern technologies are used all the time at home, at school or  working. When I was a child I didn't use the computer because I didn't know what  is that. Actually, I can work with it in my office and visitting some web-place using the new technologies such as  internet. The live is more comfortable with all the new machines you can use at home,  at the office or it is helful to live with all the new medical machines in the hospitals. The new invents have transformed my life, so it is easier with the modern technologies (the mobile, the car, the plane, the coach, the train, the medical advances and domestic machines), they have done more confortable and pleasure.

591," Dear Sirs, I cannot express how happy I was reading your letter about the prize I won and about 2 wonderful weeks I am going to spend at Camp California in the USA. With regard to your questions. First of all, I would be very happy if you could arrange my trip and stay at the camp for July. I will still be at school in June, and I am going to spend the whole  August on a training camp with my club. July is really the only available time I have. If possible, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin. I spend 3 weeks in a tent last year and it wasn't the best experience of my life. I would like to avoid tents if possible. You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train  it in August as well - I don't want to loose touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still on a beginner level. It seems like a good oportunity to practice it. Finally, I would appreciate  if you could send me some information about the weather in California at this time of year. I am a little concerned about the clothes that I should take. Does it rain a lot there? Another thing is money. How much money do you think I should take with me? Will you arrange a place where I could keep the money secure during my stay at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you and I can't wait going to  USA.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" In my humble opinion, shopping is one of he most stressful and boring activities people do in life. If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on  everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere on  top of the list. If it would be possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me. First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it's own idea of where it want's to go) between other desperate people baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste. Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that? No. Most definitely shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many, nicer ones. ",34
398," Dear Sir or Madame, I was on  week's holiday in London and I went there to the theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"". I must say that your musical show was very disappointing for me. ""Over The Rainbow"" was looking very interesting on your advertisement but  organisation and play was almost terrible. First of all I expected to see Danny Brook, but I saw  different actor and that was  big disappointment for me. Secondly the show started at quarter past eight. This is  fourty-five minutes delay. Moreover there was not any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prizes. Out the end your theatre restaurant was closed from unknown reasons, but on an advertisement  was clearly sign: ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"". That was cruel, because I was very haungry after the show. At the end of this letter I would like to ask if you can refund my money. I will be very pleased if  so. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Twentieth century was a century of inventions. Some of them are big and some of theme are small, but they effect our lives in the same way. Technology maked our life different than  life of people for example living in  nineteenth century. Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better. Often people do not see how it effects our life style. Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers, Hi-Fi stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day. They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant. Transport and communication without cars, trains, planes and telephones will not exist. We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors. Without these, and newspapers of course knowing our world could be hard. On the second hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers. On the end we must mention modern medicine. It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases. To sum up modern technology changed our daily life. Mine too. I think that I could not live  normal life without these inventions. They are like  air I breath. I am questioning myselfs - am I  sick man? ",25
687," Dear Competition Organiser: I'm so happy and exciting to receive this letter about  I've won the first prize in your competition. I've been dreaming  to travel to  U.S.A for so many years. The dream happens to me now. So I shall think about it carefully and make everything ready! I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest. And I'm sure about that the weather in July will be lovely! I prefer living in tents to living in log cabins. I think living in tents is more comfortable for sleeping. Also I am not very keen on sleeping with too many people in the same place. Basket ball is my favourite sporting. It's one of the most popular sports in  U.S.A as well in my opinion. And I was school-team player when I was in High school. So I am good at it. The other thing I would like to do is sailing. But I never try it before. I just think it will be exciting and interesting for me. Maybe I can't manage it! Also I got two questions to ask you. The first one is that shall I take a lot of money or just a little? And the last one is that do I need pillow or blanket or something else? I hope that I will enjoy my journey! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  More and more people like shopping now. You can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time, especially in Oxford Street. Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working express. But is it always enjoyable? Of course not. The most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy, you turn to the people who sell them, but they sometimes ignore you. So you like them but you don't want them any more. It makes you angry! Also for example. you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tell you ""I'm sorry, this one is sold out""! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately. And sometimes for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you were  rich man it doesn't mater, but if you were  poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable at thoese situation! So I think shopping is not always enjoyable! ",27
15," Dear Mrs. Jane Clark, Recently I was at the annual international arts festival, that you organized. I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving  a possibility to know more about modern art. I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries. Unfortunately, only six countries were represented this year at the festival, but I hope that soon there would be much more of them. I extremely liked all  concerts, shows,  exhibitions, but why there weren't any photograph exhibitions? I think, you should make some next year. Then, I want to mark, that  concert halls were too small, that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts. Then, I want to say, that  plays and films were exellent, but it wasn't enough of them for me. May be you should make more next year? And at the end, my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea, because you don't have to stay in queues to buy a ticket for a show, you want to go to. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Lucia, I was very pleased to receive your letter. You asked, if there are some school rules in my country. As you know, I'm studying at the private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes. I'll give you an example. In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke. The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars. So nobody smokes there. I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule. But some of my friends really would like to change it. You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home. Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends. The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day. I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life. Look forward to hearing from you, ",29
878," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you required some additional information. I am very happy to have won a two-week trip at Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work. Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip. As I am an expert camper, I would prefer to be accommodated in  tents  than in  log cabins. What concerns activities at the camp, I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis. The former because I am an excellent basketball-player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport as I am a complete beginner at it. I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions. I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would be suitable to bring with . I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  REPORT ON DAILY LIFE AT MY SCHOOL, FOR MY ENGLISH TEACHER Introduction After our English class' decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed. The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings. Best lessons to film As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to film Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard. Interesting activities One event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent. Conclusion In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video. Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all students. INDIAN DEMURO ",38
1095," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing, on behalf of an advanced class, to you to thank you for having organised our a three-day programme on 13th to 15th March. We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to an advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to know up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students. After consideration, we would like you to reorganise the 2nd day programme. We are politely asking you. It would be grateful if you can reorganise this matter at your earliest convenience. I look forward to meeting you to discuss this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Hide and Seek! Nowaday, a lot of celebrities, such as pop, film and sports stars, suffer from being intruded on the privacy of their lives. Undoubtedly, their the first enemies are ""Journalists"". Some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories. Because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives. Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved. On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely  intrusion on the privacy. What is more, they insist that before celebrities, they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched. In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of covering celebrities. Taking everything  account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and be in celebrities' shoes.  ",33
628," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you Very much for the letter you sent me. I am Very happy in winning this prize and I hope my stay there will be great! First of all, I can only travel in July because I have tests at school and they are Very important to me and I hope you Will understand my problem. And I Will like to be accommodated in a log Cabin, because I do not like sleeping in tents, because of the bugs and insects. For the activities I would like to chose the Tennis activities, which I am not too bad at, and climbing, Which I have never done but  must be interesting. I Would like to Know if I need to take any clothes, and, if yes, What Kind of Clothes? I also Want to Know if I should take any Money, or if all the expences are payed by You. I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Santiago  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything. But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see it, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time. And sometimes the credit card machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of your credit card. Another bad thing is that people want something very badly, and they can't afford it. That makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy theirselves. ",36
614," Dear Helen Ryan I'm writing back to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me. If it's possible I would like to travel on July because of my job. I can't leave it until this month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of the year. As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer. I would like to stay in a tent because I'm used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too. It's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer. It's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography. I have never done noon of them before and as a result I can't be good  but I've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie. I also think that it would be great to learn  photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures. If you don't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the weather of California. And also may I have to bring  money? because I know that all the costs are paid but it could be necessary for other things. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely Luna Juarez.  [SEP]  I completely agree with the following statement: ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" From my point of view a lot of people believe that it's very fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true but in my opinion go shopping can be stressing and disgusting. First of all we usually go to the shops at the same time than the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled and it's impossible to try acurately. Secondly you have to thank before you come in a shop if you're going to have  luck. I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy. Thirdly you have to pray  to find the right size and once you've got it you have to think Does it fits me? And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a big amount of money or you will end  stressed, disgusted, and depressed. At last but not at least let me give you some advice try not to go with that friend of yours that is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will be awful. ",32

Secondly, I would like to choose a tent for accommodation, because I have never spent time in a tent, that's why, I think it is a good oppotunity for me. I would like to choose swimming and photography for activities. I have a planty of experience and knowledge of both aspect of part. Lastly, I would like to ask you two questions. One of them is that what kind of clothes  suitable on this camp. Another one is that how much money I have to prepare. I will be greatfull if you could inform me. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Hi! How are you doing? I had a wonderful time last month. I helped  a pop concert as a charity. My jobs were collecting a ticket, saling goods and refreshment, guiding people to a right seat and cleaning up the concert hole after finish a concert. I wasn't allowed to help  a heavy work, even though I wanted to do, because I'm  woman. What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert had achived by our supports. It seemed that all people,  audience, the band and  stuffs were delightful. If I have  chance, I want to help  a concert again. I have never felt such as satisfaction. I really recomend you to help them, I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you understand my feeling well. I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you . I want to know your openion. If you have time, drop me a line, please. Bye ",23
674," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for the kind letter you have sent me. I am very pleased and very excited that I have won - I can't wait to go to the Camp! At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying. However I will be free in July - but please not that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California. For the accommodation, I would like to stay in tents as I have never slept in one before. It would also be a chance to try it out for the first time in my life. I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never took proper lessons. Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block? Lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet to take? Would there be a bank near the camp? Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, MIDORI FUYU  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter. You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes! Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groups instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as my balloons as we can and sprayed them with gold and silver. The concert went terrific, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having a time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me! At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alread left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night! Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it! Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck! Best wishes, ",37
326," Dear Mr Smith, I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her, after work, a very good evening with your musical show: ""Over the Rainbow"". I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show! What a surprise! Your advertisement was a quite lie and I have to tell you  my disappointment. Every point were wrong. (I wondered if it was a fake!) At first, from your advert  Danny Brook (who is a very good singer I appreciate very much)  was not here. An unknown man was singing, not in tone - awful for my ears - (poor Tina Truelove! such a professional singer with a beginner!) At second, to go on with the beginning, your show started not at 19.30 but nearly one hour later (20.15 to be more precise!) And for the third point, I would hope to offer a good diner to my friend because I knew your restaurant as a famous place but I was still disappointed. It was closed for some improvements! I hope you will understand  my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money. I join  this letter my two tickets. I am looking forward to hearing from you Best wishes  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! Poor of I, I thought it was nice to have a friend and to be able to share lots of things! I was very young when this story happened but though it was a child's adventure I remember it yet. I was just thirteen years old! I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I got a very creative imagination. To make to profit my ideas my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country. Like my heros I would like to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree. The highest tree near a river I have ever seen. Peaceful place and wonderful view. With my friend Pat (I put him in the confidence) I started to work and my idea became real. It was our fortress and every day we could improve it. The tree was our ship and the river the sea. We could play  hours and hours without seeing an adult or  other children from the village. I prefered it. It was our secret Pat and I. Child's secret. But Pat could not keep it too long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told an other friend our story. What a catestrophee! All  children went from the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry against Pat. Our quietness disappeared and very fast everybody wanted to command my ship. A desaster! There was lots of fights between us and we were naughty like child could be with other child. The result was my ship was destroyed and never more I could trust in any friend! ",23
836," DEAR MS. RYAN,  IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT. I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE WONNER OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH. IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA, WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE. ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME, ACCOMMODATION'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO. ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY. THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER. WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY. CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING (ASPECIALLY IN POLAND, WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS, MOTORS OR COMPUTERS. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST). BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR  BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION. PEOPLE, WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD  BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE). ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE. EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY). BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT. IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE-STYLE, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS. ",27
216," To: Manager of the Theatre Few weeks ago, me and my farmily had a hoilday in London, the hoilday wasn't too good! Because... During the week we descide where we want to go, we all agree to listen to music so than we descide to come to your musical show and listen to ""Over the Rainbow"". That evening we don't want to have our supper before the show Anyway I though it will be too early to eat and also because the time table or canidates you give me have say: ""visit our theatre restaurant after the show"". so we did, but unforturnily it was close and I was so dissapointed about it, nor only that we have expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to be the actor of starring. Also I don't really mind that the show start late but the rute of that evening was rucented. And there were no discounts when you say there is! Why is it every thing that on the canidates were wrong and different  what we had. We don't expect much bad to happened in our hoilday, but this was  perfectic show as well, it was the worstest show and theatre I have never been  in my life. P.S. please would you like to explain why ? We would like our money back please because every thing gone wrong, the atmosphere totally chanced! sincinerly from Ki  [SEP]  Modern technology changed our daily life In order to live happily the sciencetist can easily perdict the changes on earth, so than we can have time to perpare or defence our self from the Natural diseasters. Wapons were designed to kill and defences in a fright, in War 1945 so many German were killed, also many people die from other region. e.g. The Englishs. Posin chemical compounds e.g. gases, liquids, are created too, they were use to kill people, most of them give radiration which can disable the person, mostly harm their brain and their bodys and it could also cause deaths.

983," 20 Ibiza Road San Antonio 13/06/2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam: I'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition. First of all I'd like to thank you for the prize, I will enjoy it abosolutly. Your letter encloses an application  I have to fill  with some information for the travel. Well, as you demand, I  tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins, I'm going to be able only  this summer month because  my job responsabilities. Acording to the choice whether I prefer tends or log cabins, I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping the nearest to nature, if it's possible in front of a lake or a river, if you camping has one, so that I will be able to practise my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing. As well as this one I'll take painting, I'm very keen on art and I think I'm good at making portraits. Finally, I'd like to add some further questions: what kind of clothes do I have to bring?, Do I any kind?, and Would it be necessary to bring  money?, how much? Thank you very much, and I hope the information above would be sufficient. I look forward to hearing from you Your faithfully Jose Fernandez  [SEP]  ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than  others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners. It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering  the revenge that Heathcliff  swear,  cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but  the others character make him become thus. This revenge links the story  so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.

780," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you a lot for your letter, I am very happy of having won the competition. I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp. First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to . I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin. I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography, I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before. Finally, I would like to know what sort of clothes do  advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid , do I need to take a lot of money with me? Thank you a lot for all these details. Yours sincerely Jasmine Martin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have a lot of different things to tell you about what happened at the concert. It was really an amazing experience. First, I had to spend all  the day before the concert in the field where it took place, I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments. I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood. I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage. As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group. That was the best. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, Brenda ",34
717," Dear Helen: I have just received your letter, and I am very happy about this. Thanks very much! I think I would like to travel only on July because I've just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holidays in these days. It will be very nice for me. Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place, I think I will choose log cabins, it's sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to tents next time (maybe next year.) When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music, seem like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum liked me singing this song. And I can also make very good photography, because I learned  this in China two years ago. Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about  journey, What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? and how much does it cost per night live in a Hotel? Thanks for your help. Yours  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me too. But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable. Firstly, I am a student, I don't have  job, so, I have to asked  money from my parents. I can't asked  too much that's very bad for my parents. When I go shopping. I alway feel shame because I spend my parents money. (although I got  part-time job, it  just enough to pay my rent.) Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things  always expensive. You should spend more money on buying clothes and food,  you will  very happy when you buy it, but, when you come back home  take out you purse, you must be feel sad, you purse  nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money.) Sometimes, when you shopping on the street, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy it once,  you will feel very sad maybe. And then, you may save money for the things you like, nothing to do, just for the poor things what you like so funny isn't it? Another thing is when you shopping in a busy street, seem like oxford st in London. a lot of thief  there, they will steal you money, that's so dangerous. So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me. It will stop when I get a good job. Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it. ",23
1118," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing on behalf  my English class. We have just known the programme you prepared for our three-day trip to London. Thank you very much for  many interesting positions in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are shure, will be very exciting. I would like to inform you, that we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Laisure Show"" and we have found it very interesting. There will  a lot of show for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be  great opportunity, because the entrance is free for students. The even is planned on  14th of March between 10.00 am and 19.00 p.m. If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme. We will be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday's afternoon. We have checked that it is open every day. As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be  nice prize for our work during this year. I would b grateful if you  consider our suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was night and I was alone in my house. Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it. The outside lights were broken down and I couldn't see anything. My dog was very angry. I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get to my house. After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen's window. I was very frethend, but I knew, that I should do something. I had no time to call someone and I had to go to my kitchen to check what it was. I stood against the window and I started to listen. I was shure there were someone on the other side of the wall. It was terrible, I thought that it was the last day of my life. Suddenly someone broke my window. I had no time to think, I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head. One moment later I called  police. He was a thief, who were looked for for many years. ",31
719," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing  you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have. First of all I want you to know I am really happy about the prize. The only problem is that like I am a student I can travel only during  holidays, in July. Refering to accommodation I would rather to stay in  tents because I have never gone on camping so I would like to have the experience. I am not really keen on art that is why I  prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing. If I have to be honest, I would say I have never practised none of them. Yet, I would like to try them because my city is too far from the sea so I don't have many opportunities of doing them. I would appreciate  if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take. Besides, I wonder if I will share the tend or not and if I have to take it from here or if it will be provided by you. I am looking fordward to hearing from you. Yours Natalia Lorena Kraus  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't told you  the experience of the pop concert in detail in my last letter  was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now. As few months ago I chated, by  internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires, who happened to be one of the member of ""Los Pericos"". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They have to make a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me  where they were preparing the concert. The problem was that one of the technics was from England and nobody there spoke nor a word in English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English. I hope you are not angry any more after this letter. I'm looking fordward to hearing from you. love, ",32
329," Dear Sir, According to the evening I have passed in your theatre, I was supposed to see ""Over the rainbow"" (as you wrote on the publicity paper). However, it was absolutely not like you described! First, there was a big late about the time. The show begun 45 minutes later than supposed! To make matter worse, we have never had the oppurtunity to see Danny Brook because, instead, there was a different actor! How can you explain that big mistake? At the top of everything, you proposed us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. How could we visit this place, if it is not open?! You wrote so persuately that it would be our ""Perfect Evening Out""... I am really disappointed about this experience. I spent £20 - and  not as you wrote  ""discount available"". I will not make troubles but I ask you politely  my money back. I hope, you will agree and share my disappointement. I am looking forward to staying in contact with you. Sincerly yours,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Future, Everybody ask how will our world look like. What's about the fashion in 100 years? I think we have to take in consideration our enviroment: The pollution makes more and more the atmosphere warmer. In fact, winterseason will be rare or will maybe even disappear. The ice will smellt, the weather will be warmer. People won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certenly be sinthetic, because there won't be enough place to cultivite cotton and to let grass sheeps. Community: Another very important point! Electronical community takes more and more pace in our habitual lifestyle. We  see, the objects will come smaller. So small that I can  imagine, they will be introduce (maybe like chips) in our clothes. Our feelings will be transmit electronical through our clothes to other people. I think at  internet. "" Internet on our body"".. I'm shure that is not impossible! Clothes will take a very important place in our future. They will be like a second skin. Or do you think, an icetime will come? ",13
68," 16.12.2000y Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to you in connection with the advertisement in  newspaper. I would like to express a couple of thoughts that I have after the festival that I have recently seen. I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festivel, connected with art and culture. Especially the date was very suitable for me, as I have a lot of free time. What is more there was a wide vareiety of music Although the artists were supposed to be from all counties, there were only six nationalities. I hope that next year there will be much more possibilities to enjoy films or plays and that the halls will be bigger, as they were overcrowded. However I was really suprised that the entrence fee was so low. I have also one suggestion, if I may. Maybe next year the festival could be ended with  fireworks show. Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advices would occur useful. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Tom, Just I got your letter and sat  straight away to write  you a few sentences that will illustrate my opinion. To begin with, I'd like to show you how are my obligations at school. Although we have to change our boots, we don't need to wear special uniforms. Our clothes should be in a good taste. We are also allowed to have jewellery and a make-up, what's especially crucial for girls. When it goes to my home, I think I have  usual duties I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. However my parents aren't demanding, I have to be home at  least at 11 o'clock and tell them where I go out. In my opinion there's nothing special that I'd like to change,  maybe only this, that I wouldn't have to change my boots. I hope that it'll claryfy your questions and doubts. So, that will be everything as for now. I'm looking foreward to hearing from you. Yours ",26
1147," Dear Mrs Smith With reference to the information that you had requested, the hotel that had been booked is the Holiday Inn, in New Port and to get to the University of Wales wich is not far from the hotel, you only need to take a divertion where clearly indicate Carleon and once that you are on the main road all you need to do is to follow the country road which take you direct to the place. Concerning to the Party at the end of the Conference, this will be formal there fore you will need formal clouding as you know there will be Company directors, Managers etc . As for the last day I would suggest you to take a visit to the locall museum and the ruin's   Castle. In the fist you will find a very intresting collection of Roman Vestiges, also you can visit another section wich it supoused to be a Roman cite. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  I always had consider myself been very looky to be born in the  Century because  all the amaizing human inventions. As an example let's have a look and we will see of this nation  how it has developed. We just need to think about the first world wold and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution to these day. However I feel that at the moment there should emerge more grups to control this development because  the industrial polution that it has been created and it seems that its very little what has been done at the moment in relation to our embiroment. I hope in the future there will be more and more people interested in this important issue. ",21
340," Dear Mr Redford, I'm writing to you to complain about the problems which were shown at the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show. In the advertisement I read that Danny Brook started in the show but when I got there I realised there was a different actor in his place whose acting wasn't good enough. I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't. It started at 20:15 leaving us writing for fourty five minutes. You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it. In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening in the show very unpleasant. As you are the manager of the show, you should try to avoid this sort of problems in future shows. I also ask  to return me some of my money for the unpleasant evening I passed at your show.  [SEP]  In the future people will wear clothes made of polyseer and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive. Clothes will be bright coloured and loose. I don't think anyone will wear a suit as it will be old-fashioned. Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong sunrays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will make damage to the human skin. Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm in cold winters' days. As you can realise I think  future's clothes will be adjusted not on only in fashion and the seasons but in the needs of every on as to protect from the earths pollution as well. ",34
256," 17th June 2000 The Manager The Circle Theatre My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially of the funny actor ""Danny Brook"". When we saw your advertisement in the ""Evening Post"" we made a reservation. Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that  actors have been changed at the last minute. In addition, there was no discount available,  the show started at 20:15 and not at 19:30. After that, your restaurant was closed whitout reason. We are very disappointed. It was not a ""perfect evening out"" but ""a dreadful evening out"". It would be nice from you if you could refund us some money or send us two new ticket. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, ",17
1132," Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we write this letter to you, is because we would like to thank you for this short trip in London. We believe that the programme is very cood and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that. The other reason as I mention earlier is because of a request off all the class. We've seen an advertisement in the newspapers, about a Fashion exhibition in London on Tuesday the 14 of March. That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a college. So we had this great idea if it is possible of course to include this exhibition in our programme. The exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it taking place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London From 10.00 till 19.00. The class is very exiting about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make up and hair styles. We believe that  is a great opportunity because  is one of the best shows of the year, also a majority of the class never had the change to visit a show as this and the most important and best part is that the admission is Free for Students. And that we found it very good as otherwise we could not afford it. So please if it is possible  to make a small change to the programme and to move the activities of the Tuesday 14 of March to the 15 of March  as to try to make a combination of the 2 days. We hope we do not cause any problems to your programme and hope that you will except our request. From all your class Thank you  [SEP]  ""FAME"" What a word!! I'm sure that the people that had decided to meet this word they did not realised that there is a price to pay. I believe that any famous people such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for a various reasons. First of all they are humans like everyone else, so yes everyone want privacy in their lifes. is the same right for all of us as a human be. Of course on you are on the public eye, the reasons are different when you want privacy. Becaues if you are a politician as an exmaple, you fear for your life. You need to protect your life of any danger. Becaue  ",25
741," Dear Miss Ryan. I am writing to inform  the further information about myself. I was very glad to hear that I won the competition. First of all, I can only travel in July. I have a summer holiday from at the end of June to at the begging of September as I am a student, but I am planing to work in August as a part-time job. So that's the reason why I can not travel in August. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins, because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents. It was great to have a fun and also it was very good memorise. As you said I will have the opportunity to do two activities. I am quite good at singing and I have a talent about singing that  I can entertain people by singing. In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn swimming but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be  good chance to improve my swimming. In fact, I have some questions that how much money I will need, what else I have to bring with  and if I have a emergency what you can do for. Once again, I am very happy to have such a good opportunity and I hope this letter can bring what you want to know about me. Thank you for your attention. Yours sincerely Lee. Han  [SEP]  These days, there are so many people  like shopping that it is one of the important part in our life. It is not, however, always enjoyable that there are both advantages and disadvantages. First of all, there are quite many advantages of shopping  are that it can be the solvation of our stress and boring. When you are under stress or when you are bored, if you go to shopping, then at least it can be  motive to change your mode. Also shopping makes people happier by using a lot of money and it influnce even  economic situation more flexably. There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time. When we are having a shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired. Also there are plenty of dangerous that lots of people have  wallet stollen because it is a public place and there are too many people. In addition shop owner often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly. The customer can never know what price is the normal  unless they have a same shop or  same thing. To sum up, shopping is  very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we can not find only advantages from it. ",22
1083," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writting this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London. I see that you has already organised the programme. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and they would all like to go to the show. So I'm writting this letter, asking, if you can change the programme. The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is realized once a year, there are the latest Fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles, all things that a young people wants to see. There is a great opportunity to go there because the students need not pay anyting. I'm suggesting how  programme could be changed. The fashion  starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be realized on 14 March, so we can change the shopping with this event that is realized in the afternoon, and put the shopping at night. There will be a great success! Your sincerely, X teacher.  [SEP]  The Dangerous Mission. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it""... That was my situation at the moment. The story had began two days before... ""The Honorable men's group"", Dick, Nick and I, has formed this group. Our mission was, stealing the women's panties, I think that it was very stupid, but it was the most difficult thing that the humanity can do. It prove our bravura to be a man. Our first chalenge was stealing Dick's girlfriend's pantie, but it failed. And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we had a conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult. So we tried to stole adult's panties. Nick and Dick could prove their bravure stealing from their mother's panties. I was the only one that couldn't stole any panties. So I decided to go to my grand mother's house and try to steal some panties. But she was a very angry woman. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it"", to prove my bravure to all. I had quickly, entered in my grandmother's room and started to get some panties. I was very nervous that I forgot my shoes. Next day my Grand mother come and she gave my shoes to my mother. That was the most dangerous mission of my life. ",22
599," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thank you for the letter. It sounds great. I can't believe it but I'm really pleased to hear that I won first prize. Firstly I can travel only in July because I'm studying at college until the end of June and in August I'm travelling  Greece for one months. Secondly I would like to stay in log cabins because it would be more spacious and comfortable than tents. I'll tell you  two activities I chose. I would like to play tennis and swim. I'm belonging to a tennis club and it is the most favourite sports. I sometimes have a match with friends. I go swimming once a week. I like swimming because I can relax in water. Lastly, could I ask you something? How is the weather like in California? Do I need clothes with long sleeves? How much money should I bring? Can I change money for US dollars there? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable.' Is it true or not? Generally women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who  keen on finding stuffs which are good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowdy shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting. For the women, too. If they can't find things which they expected, they go there just only to get tired. Shopping is enjoyable when you find exactly what you want in a calm shop but not always. ",33
206," Dear Mr Manager With reference to the show last week. I am writing to complain about the show, which was very disappointed. In the advertisement, it state that the actor for this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE. As a result I asked my acquintance to come with me to the show. As soon as the show started. I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY. I was very disappointed. In addition the concert didn't start on time. It was  quarter of an hour late. If I knew that the show was going to be late, I would ask my mom to come with me, because her working hour ended at eight o'clock. The restaurant was closed after the show ended. On the other hand there were no discounts available, as a result I had to paid extra money for the tickets. In conclusion it wasn't a perfect evening, I didn't enjoy it at all due to the failure advertisement. I would like to ask for my money back. Your sincerely Thatt Chitchee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As a result Mallory had been arrested by the police two years ago. In addition he had to serve a life sentences. The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat had planned the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. As a result the only way to get into the building was at the top of the build. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in at the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond. He ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him. By the time he got out of the building, the cops was ever where but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his unpredicatable mind. He ran into the old build, and hidden a diamond in there. Unfortunately the building was a police station. ",25
744,"  Misses Helen Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel. You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accomodation I would like to have and so on. Travelling in July, I have to say, would be perfect for me because I have got my birtday the 24th of this month and I wish I could spend my birtday as well as possible, so it means there. I also would prefer to sleep into  tents which are more comfortable and, because I have been doing lots of campings, I am quite used to this kind of accomodation. The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me. Painting and swimming are my way to spend a good time especially on holiday. I may have a question for you to answer, please could you tell my how much money do I need to bring with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. However it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more, it is very fashionable those times. They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do. Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway. Is it enjoyable to walk around shops, looking at nice stuff, without having enough money to spend on it? Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance? Enjoying shopping isn't the reason for doing that. I think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human being. ",25
453," Dear manager I am writing  you because of your new musical show ""Over The Rainbow''. I have spent my holiday in London recently and it is like a tradition, we went to a musical. After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it. But firstly when we bought our tickets, we didn't get any discount, we had to pay the full price. And then the show started at 20:15 p.m., although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m., so we've had to wait quite long in this crowded room. And when the show finally started, I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting, instead there was an unknown, not very talented actor. After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant, because we were very hungry, but then we saw that it was closed, because of staff illness. I would like to ask you to give us our money back, because it has been a very disappointing evening for us. Yours sincerely, Sara Schmidt  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We sometimes tried to make surprise parties, but it never worked because of him. Two weeks before his birthday he started asking us what we were gong to do. That annoyed us so much, that we started making something up. We told Pat we couldn't have a party on his birthday, because everyone except me had something to do. Of course, that wasn't , we had actually organised a party for him with all his friends since a long time go, but he wasn't supposed to know that. On his birthday all our friends were at my place, waiting for Pat. I had invited him to opened the evening with me. But half an hour before he should have been there he phoned me and said he was too tired to come. I couldn't change his mind although I've tried everything. In the end I just told him the truth. He was very sorry that he had not want to come and arrived quite soon then. But I know now, that it is always better not to lie even if it should be for  good . ",33
277," Dear Sir or Madam I'm writting to you to complain about the musical show that I saw when I went to the theatre on my holidays in London. First of all I had read in the advertisement that it would start at 19:30 and that I would have some discount, but it started at 20:15, what means that I had to wait for forthy five minutes, and there wasn't any discount on tickets. For my surprise Danny Brook never apeard. There was a different actor instead and it put me very nervous. He is my favorite actor and I pay to saw him not to saw a different actor. Finally at the end of the sow I decided to went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it wasn't been repeard yet. I think you must told people about this in the advertisement. I was a bit disappointed because you told that it would be a perfect evening and it wasn't. I enclose my postal addresses and I will be looking forward to a completly refound Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future We could see all over the human being How the fashion change in its colours and styles, Since the first men on the earth started to wear  kind of clothes because they were a bit cold Asking people about the Fashion of the Future you realise that there are different opinions. Adults think that  new coloured clothes, that young people wear are horrible an very untraditional. Most of them believe that they are kind of crazy or ievel. They think that in the future they will change and start to wear more formal clothes. On the other hand young people believe that in the Future things'll be very different. Carol,  16 years old girl, said ""I imagine clothes in the future  very strang. May be they would have  many colors and they would be very thight. They would be sinthetic clothes, I think made of plastic or something similar."" Most young people as Carol believe the same and use their minds to imagin the variety of clothes in the future. After wear they'll be the ones that dicide How the Fashion of the Future will be like. ",21
1033," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing  you to thank  for your program which will be for us in the next three days in London. Especially, sightseeing by bus in the morning and  river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities. On your program of Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show which is held once a year. This show  give us a lot of informations about current activities, fashion and what is happened here in London  for example  lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn  london culture. We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion. The admission is free for students. The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon program  to go to the show at  Central Exhibition Hall instead. If you agree, after  Science Museum, we can have lunch at  restaurant near the musuem, then we  go directly from the restaurant to  Central Exhibition Hall. We will be on time for the second show at 13.30 P.M and we can enjoy the show until 19.00 P.M. I'am looking forward to hearing your opinion on my suggestion. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future ""Home"" has so much meaning to the people. It doesn't mater who they are, where they are coming from, which color of their skin they have. Home is  institution that create human and make them as a person and a good member in their communities. When I think of ""the Home of the Future"". I want to have a home which is built with a new material. Home made out of plastic  also windows made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time. The door it is broken, we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic. We have more time to stay together at home, watching TV, playing games, etc.... because we can access to  internet at home we can have all  informations from  internet. I think it is the best way of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home. We have more time for the family who need mostly care and love. It will be a numer of Developments in Technology in the future, which can make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is  feeling of being together and love. This 2 feelings can not be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home of the future. ",26
310,"  Mr/Mrs... manager I am writing to you about your musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". I have come and see  the theatre but I am very disappointed. I have come to see a good theatre but I did not. Danny Brook was going to be the starring actor but he wasn not,  actor took his place. That was very disappointing. The play was going to start at 19.30 but is was very delay It start at 20.15. And this is not all there is more. In the advertisement you write that there is  biscount available but It was not. Also the restaurant was closed because there was not left any food. I think the next time you write an advertiment you  write it with the right information. I did not have a perfect evening with so many proplems. So I am asking  to retern me some money back. I hope to hear from you soon Yours fouthfouly   [SEP]  Techology is a bad or a good efection?

1228,"  Mrs Maria Smith, I'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference. The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc. To get from the hotel to the conference, you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne, and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet, Divonne. When you come out, just go on your right, and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school. The end-of-conference party will take place at the same place. Some musicians will play classical music, and there will be many different drinks and food. you should wear some formal clothes, but not necessary really pretty clothes For three hours, you could visit the museum of the Red Cross, which is very interesting. I hope that these informations will help you Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  The portable phone, a very useful invention! During all mankind history, there were discovers who tried to make human life better, but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made. When the phone without  cable was invented, one wasn't sure if it would be a success or not. But the research went on, and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful. The portable phone is an important invention, because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem. Moreover, some portable phones have a connection to the web, so it is easy to read  newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it. Personally, the portable phone has affected my own life, because when somebody is phoning  at home, I don't have to rush to take the phone, being afraid that it's too late. I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still don't have a portable phone. ",31
318," Dear Sir or madam For weeks I've been planing to go to this threatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster has all of us. To begin with on your advertisment you say that Danny Brooks will be starring  the show but instead their was a different actor which made us very disappointed. Another thing that is written on the advertisment is that the night show will start at 7:30 but instead of that their was  forty five minute delay The crowded got really upset and we were going to leave with the first chanse we had To make matters worse the restaurant of the theatre was closed. You can understand how that made me feel, and when the tickets had no discount To top of it all, this wasn't the perfect evening out. It was the worst night of my life. So I expect nothing less than a full refund of the money I paid to see this so called show. If you don't do as I say an article in the biggest newspaper will deffenetly change your ming Yours sincerely  [SEP]  What are going to look the clothes  in a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to have colours, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxershorts? This is something that has trabled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry. Fashion has made a big progress since the ealary beggining of the world. The variety of new fabrics,  colours and quality,  make new fashions statements every day. Although the clothes are getting more and more smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashing  the women to wear only skirts. Long ones actually and  men to wear trousers. In the sixties people worn clothes with flowers, big glasses,  jeans, and men should have had long painted hair. Nowdays women were really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pearce their bodys just like girls do. and the other way around. If this continues the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (;practically people won't be wearing any clothes) People will were extreme. Clothes which will be really Lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but nowone wears them. ",24
31," Dear Jane Clark, I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you have organized. I enjoyed it very much and I think you have had a great idea. I went to all the events, they were really good. I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world, even if the number of countries was very little, only six. Why don't you let more countries to participate next year? I also liked the concerts. But, can I give you a suggestion for next year? Try to find bigger halls, because this year they were really too small! I enjoyed all the plays and films, but they were fewà why don't you broadcast more at  next Festival? I also went to the dance shows, the art exhibition and the talks by writers, they were really very nice and interesting. I also agree with you about the ticket's prize. In fact, it was really a reasonably-priced ticket, excellent because you could go to all the events only with it. And that's the reason because lots of people came. An admiree  [SEP]  Capua, 16/12/2000 Hi Jane, how are you? I received your letter yesterday, and I want to answer you soon! I think the discussion in your class was very interesting. In my country there are different rules at school, but I think they are, more or less, the same in England. You have to begin your lesson at 8.25 and wait for the teacher of the next lesson in the class. You have a break of ten minutes, that you would have to do in class. You can't speak during the lesson or outside the classrooms. You can't write on walls and desks.. I have some rules also at home, but they are few. I can do everything I want, except going out with the car during the night. My parents are afraid of it because I took my licence only in September. My parents also like eating all together, but it isn't a rule, only an habitude! I don't think there is something I'd like to change! I like my life, both at school and at home! Write to me soon ",29
23," Dear Mrs or Miss Jane X, I am writing to thank you for the annual international arts festival which was organized on 21st-22nd November. I had spent at this festival for two days. It was a great idea to organize such  festival. I am a teacher and I love music. Most of the events which I had seen were good. I enjoyed  dance shows,  jazz and rock concerts. I visited art exhibitions. There were a lot of nice pictures, sculptures and other creative works. I was impressed by them. At  festival I could talk with writers. It was an excellent idea to make one reasonaly-priced weekend ticket for all events. A lot of people could visit as many events as the they could. I was very surprised when I knew that  stars and artists were only from six countries. It was too little for this festival. It was  pitty that too small halls were used for  classical concerts. I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sounds of  music were terrible. I have some suggestion for next year's festival. Firstly, it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands. The second one is to include more musical films and plays. I would like to help you in your interesting job. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Traditional Folk Stories of the World There are a lot of folk stories in the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia, I would like to tell you one of them. This story is about a man and his three sons. This story happened a long time ago. The man was old and his sons were young. One day the man quarreled with his sons and they left the house trying to find work. They were successful. And they had lived far from their father for two years. They grow up and became wise. They decided to return to his father because he was old and he needed help. When the sons were old they began to tell about their life beginning with this story happend a long time ago ",32
418," Dear sir, I bought a ticket for the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show last Saturday, but I felt very disappointed with it. It was announced that there would be discount tickets available, but there were not. The show should have started at 19.30, but it  delayed forty-five minutes. And, the worst of all: Danny Brook was not on stage. He was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance. Last, the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a tube and the kitchen was flooded. I think there are sufficient reasons for   money back. I just wanted to have a pleasant evening out and I could ever imagine that there would be so many troubles. I really expect that you  consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket, as soon as possible. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Several technological advances in the past five years have changed my daily life. Nowadays, I feel myself entirely linked to these innovations, and I would find it hard to live without them.  Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations. Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, that would take a much longer time  to be found by traditional means. For a shy person, like me,  Internet has another attractive: the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide. It's very exciting. Currently, I exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country. Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car is broken  on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth. Modern technology granted other facilities: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait on a big queue to be attended by the cashman, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.

115," Dear Manager, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show, I have seen last week. There is some disagreement a between your advertisement and  show, which I could see at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I would like to indicate that you put  wrong starting and finishing hours. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned. It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming back home at night - when it finished. Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook at the stage. She is my famous artist and I was coming there mainly because of him. If this made me really disappointed - he wasn't playing there. Another point, I want you to consider, is  restaurant. The place you have offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you have closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us  anything to eat? Finally, you have advertised, I would have  perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back. I think, this could be the only, right possibility for me, to forget about my not interesting evening. I would appreciate it, if you could consider my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE Try to imagine: the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny large shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them. It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books. It's a REALITY, its the FASHION OF THE FUTURE... People were wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing: style, colour qual. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years. The climate is changing, so we would have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope, there will be times, when women would like to be again thought as delicate and sensible human beings. Showing their figure, they would have  possibility to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it will be  the past. Streets of  21st century will be smart. So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very poor. This fashion is coming, so think about it. Grey and black - like weather seasons, like people charakters, like all  night and dark sourranding us. These are the colours of the FUTURE. ",20
694," Dear Mz. Ryan, Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your compition. However, I am writing to you to ask for more details. Firstly, I would like to go to California in June if his is possible because I will have finished my course in Merton college at the end of June. Secondly, I would prefer to staying in a tent rather than staying in a log cabin in order to have  experience, which I haven't had before. I am very knee on swimming and playing tennis so that I have had a part-time job in a sports centre in the evenings. I also have qualifications to teach them. In addition to all this, I would appriciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the travel. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  To: Mrs. Sexington From: An Soo Kim Subject: Speaking classes and school trips Introduction. The aim of this report is to describe our English classes in Merton College and suggest that what we should film for making a short video. Speaking class should be filmed. It is suggested that speaking classes should be filmed the reason why is that the more students tend to attend.

School trips It is also thought that school trips are to be filmed because it is a wide range of interesting places available. It is believed that  one of the most popular activities in Merton College. Conclusion To sum up, it is recommened that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed. ",23
26," Dear madame Jane Clark, I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago. I was there  two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world. Well, here are some of my opinion and suggestions. First of all, I think there should  more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only from six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world. The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls  to small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent. Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events. Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate  for the great sucess in the festival. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Emily, Hello! It's been such a long time since we wrote to each other. Well, in the letter you wrote me, you asked some questions about school and house rules. Even though, I do have less than you, I'm still willing to change many things. In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either. At home, there are less rules. My parents don't really like putting rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back. But it existed since I was very young. I would like to change the rule  not to speak in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish but I guess to learn. we should speak English all the time. Well, that's all. I hope one day you get to change what you wanted. I miss you and let's keep in touch. Bye.. your Pal, ",32
669," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Regarding your letter dated on the 6th of June I'm so happy to receive the first price. Thanks very much. I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school on this time. Although, the accommodation isn't so important for me. I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed. I have choosen the activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner on both activities. I have some questions as follow: 1. What kind of clothes are needed? 2. What  I have to pay by myself? 3. Should I take some money with me? 4. How is the wheather in California? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly, A. Becker  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable. There are a lot of reasons  that could be awful to go shopping. Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find. I had once this problem. I was looking for a special fruit. The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice and helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as ,,customer treat with order"". Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful. He wanted everything what his eyes saw. All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfy  the store. The shops have bad opening times. When I feel me comfortable for shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around. My conclusion on these points are not so bad. I like shopping at all with my best friend.

1170," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college. I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel. It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college, where the conference is going to be held. I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus. The bus stop  you should get off is called ""The Green Man"". With reference to the end-of-conference party, which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight, I would like to mention the necessary dress code. It is an evening dress for women and black trousers, a white shirt and a black bow tie for men. Lastly, I would like to give you some suggestions about way in which you can spend your free time in our town. I am strongly convinced, that you should visit  local Science Museum. Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum. I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As it is widely known, lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century, nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer. It is a fact, that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information. Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants, designers, engineers and so on and on. Another point in  favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet. It allows you to have all the necessary information ""on your fingertips"". Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world, which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment. To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries wouldn't have been so concerned about  so-called ""problem 2000"" if the computer had not been so important for the modern society. ",30
1157," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm very glad to be able to help you out with such  sutiation. First of all, the group has been booked into 'THE PALACE HOTEL'. You won't have any problem to find the college because it's in front of the Hotel, and the conference will be there. As you know, the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00, but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college's hall until 14:30. You'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers, if you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket. When we had finished you'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room, but if you prefer other things, we've got a swimming pool and a library, it will  your own choice. I hope it was useful for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Group leader, In order of your request, I'm going to give you some information about which is the best place to visit in this town, Fuengirola. Fuengirola has a wonderful and beautiful castle which is right on the sea front. It is placed on the top of a little hill which is part of the beach. You can't lose the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs. At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a breake to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea, it is also amazing. Also, there is a museum of history inside. As you see, you have to visit the castle, you won't feel regret about that. Your sincerley, ",22
861," Dear Sir/Madam, I was very pleased to receive your letter which informed me of my winning the first prize in your competition, namely two weeks at Camp California in the USA. To begin with, I would like to travel in July. This is the only possible time for me, as the school holiday starts on the 29th of June. And from August on I planed to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money. Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days. As I had been asked to choose two activities I would like to  during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I get lessons in it. I just love singing. I would like to know whether there is some facilities for washing the Clothes. Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily. Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me. Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollar? I ask you to enclose the answer in your reply. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully Mee-Yon Areum.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoires etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be. Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search of an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends. Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without ""touching"" the others. It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out. Of course, shopping is not always so unpleasant, but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home. ",34
730," Dear Ryan Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition. I am writing to inform you  my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July. I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July. And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent. I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel  wilder experience. While I am at the camp, I would like to enjoy swimming and photography. It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy  fresh air. Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can. I would like to know about the weather in the camp area because I don't know what kinds of clothes I have to bring. And I want to know how much money I have to carry for personnal expences. I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping. Thank you for your kindness and I look forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Clark. ",12
99," Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day in your theatre. I am afraid but I think that the show was not as good as I expected: the reason were many. - Danny brook did not play and I wanted to see him. - the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30. Please check your times because many people had to leave at the middle of the show. - When the musical finished I was terrible hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open. In conclusion that evening was not ""my perfect evening out"" so I want you to refund me the money. I look forward to your reply. Yours Faithfully, Manuel Juan Sargo  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my life in many difents ways: But this ""modern technology"" has advantages and disadvantages. In on hand we have the advantages the new technology permits you  many things like fly, see in the dark, or  even save your life when you are almost dead. But in the other hand we have the disadvantages. The technology makes your life easier but, until when? For example, the car was developed by the modern technology, it makes your life easier but also  ""dangerous"". Why? Because too many cars mean too much CO2 in the air. And all people know that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kind of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give  and permit you  may things wich would be impossible in other times but also gives you many problems. ",29
869," June 13, 2000 Competition. Organiser Helen Ryan Dear Madam: I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my tests. I will do  F.C.E in  University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school. I prefer my accommodation at Camp in tents because it reminds me  my first school. It was great. But the way, I do not like to stay alone. I would like to have lots of people near me. Among those activities that you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes about them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is my challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it. I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend. I want to know if I can take my celular phone, too. Sincerely MARGARET BORNETE GOODS  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Women love shopping. I am a woman then I love it a lot. All weekends I and my boyfriend go to  B.H Shopping Center. I live in Site Belo and he lives near  B.H. Shopping Center. I retired four years ago and my live is very bored. When I am very sad I like to buy something and sometimes it makes me happy. I bought a lot of shoes, clothes and books last week. He was with me and suddenly he became very angry. He told me that I was very stupid. I tried to buy a handsome suit for him but he shouted and abandoned me with my bags. I took a cab and went to my house. I cried very much because my life is really very stupid. I decided to stop buying those things that I don't really need. I intend to continue studying and return to work because when our life is empty everything looks ugly and sad. I know in deep of my heart sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. But I am a woman. We are different. We need different things than men. Yesterday he called me and told me that he loves me, anyway. I believe him because he is a great man. I hope that he forgets  my shopping. And I decided I will go shopping alone. At last I am really a great woman and I love myself. ",30

872," Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you for your letter. I'm very happy that I have won. You ask me when I would like to travel? I can travel only in July because I have  holidays from my work only in this month. So it would be very nice, if it's possible. By the Accomodation at the Camp, I would prefer the tents, because it is something different wich you don't make everyday! Then the activities that I would like to do are Singing and Swimming. Singing because it's my favourite hobby and I grew up with it and Swimming because I like water and the feeling that you have when you are in it. Another reason for  swimming is that I'm good at it because a few years ago I had lessons, where I learn very good swimming. Finaly I've got a question: What clothes must I bring with me and how much money? I'm looking forward  hearing from you. yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Everybody likes shopping! To look for clothes and shoes is for every women one of their favourite hobby and if it were possible they would stay the whole day in the shopping-centre. But shopping isn't always enjoyable. Sometimes it isn't so easy to find what you need. For example: you have in your memory a great pair of shoes that you have seen last week in a shop. Now you will by it but it's nowhere to find! That's a pity! Sometimes it's very awful when you have to wait  very long  until it's your turn to pay or to try some clothes on. Another thing that makes you fourious, is when you see a great shirt in  shop and somebody else take it away or buy it before you can react. That things had happend to everybody, hadn't they? So you see that shopping isn't always enjoyable. ",24
998," Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you very much. I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel only in July, because in June I have to study at school which hasn't finished until the end of June. In August, I have already made another appointment with my friends. We are going to visit the places of interest of China, as usual, our new term begins in September. I only can travel in July Accommodation I would prefer in tents to in log cabins. Tents are very easy to take and  go everywhere. What's more, in my opinion it is very romantic. I am good at singing and photography. I can sing most kinds of songs, such as pop music, folk. I like taking photograph, in my only room. There are all kinds of photos, for example,  beach, sea trees and so on. In the end, I wonder what kind of clothes I should take and how much money I should bring with me. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  To: Mrs Flame From: Kate Subject: which lessons and other activities should be filmed Instruction: The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons  be filmed into a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class. Results: The majority of them said it's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills. Sixty percent recommended that the activity which called make the brain up in the morning class should be filmed. Ten of them said  should make the computing. Two thirds said we should film a part of playing football. Reasons: Although Maths is very boring, it is very important in nowadays. English is the most popular language in the world, what's more, more and more people start to learn English. The activity of making brain up can help us remember new words. Playing football is good for  health. Conclusion: It is recommended that  should be filmed about Maths, English study skills,make brain up and a part of playing football. ",26
80," 16/12/2000 Dear Jane Clark, First of all, I'd like you to know that the whole organization was nearly excellent. I spent two nice days at the festival full of art. The idea of making the festival ""international"" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small.  Plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows made  sight for our sour eyes, they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas,  their life styles by talking to them. Beyond all these, the application of joining  all  activities by one nice-priced ticket was excellent; because it saved you from  buying one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and others,  also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect. Thank you for making a great festival which made all the art activities come together. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Jennifer, I'm glad that everything's going on well there. It's the same here. I've got too many exams nowadays, but that's all. By the way, it would be better If you wrote quite often to me. The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very diciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours. I understand the second part, but I can't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only. Do we become the ""perfect one"" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much more free at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want at my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them. Don't ever forget to write to me, okay? Love, ",31
269," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW' I attended three days ago. I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many  problems. Firstly, the start time  was at 19.30 p.m, but the play started at 20.15 p.m. People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous. Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor  I had never heard from him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that  was impossible to fine another with the same features. As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available, so, moreover I found it expensive. After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense! The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money, as I think it is fair. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully, MARIA GARDENT  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But this time things have gone too far. I've know Pat since we were kids. Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends. I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent. I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now  my mind have changed, because she has done something I can't approve. She has given  away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned. Pat told her I hadn't spent those days with her, but with my boyfriend in the mountain. My mother was so hungry and she told off me so hard that I will remember it  the rest of my life. Moreover I was punished hardly by my father and now we don't talk  each other. Since then I haven't seen Pat anymore and she seems not regret that happened, so I'll try to forget her and carry on  my life that's all. ",26
904," Dear Mrs Helen, It is great to hearing from you. I cannot believe I'm the winner of your competition. I'm really very happy. As far as some further information you need from me is concerned, I am very glad to give you all the details of the matter. I would like to travel on July; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course a University at the end of June and I will start to work in September. As far as accomodtion is concerned, I would like to live in  tents at Camp California. I prefer this type of accomodation because I am used to living in tents during my summer holidays. As I am an athletic swimmer and a good surfer too, my choice from your attached list is naturally swimming and surfing. I like to travel with light logguage and I have no idea about the weather; could you suggest me what kind of clothes I have to bring with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Hi Kim! It's great to hearing from you! The last month concert! The singer was fabulous and the musicians played fantastic songs. I was employed in the security service. I did it for free because it was a non-profit concert for helping the poor people. It was the first time for me and I consider this experience the best of my life. I had to look after people near the stage. The organiser gave me a radio and I had to advise the other staff members in case of  disorder. At the same time I could enjoy the music! I think this is what I particularly liked about this experience. I suggest you to try this kind of experience. You should be pride of you helping people who suffers, and at the same time you may enjoy yourself! I am looking forward to seeing you! Love ",32
388," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre. According to the advertisement, one of the actor who had to show was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another disappointing actor instead of him. By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it had to start at 19:30: it wasn't in late, it was to much in late. We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for. And what's more, there weren't  discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff. Well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I pretend to have my money back, I waisted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programm I payed for. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Your sincerely  [SEP]  Science and technology have changed man's life: that's true, I don't need to look  how they affect the lives of the others, I have only to see how they have changed my life. Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that  borns from the technology. Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something  intersts you. But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed: in my mind all must be in order like in a CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of  mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take part of my life. In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in order to meet new people, to speak with them  to have a contact with the ""human world"". Am I crazy? No, I'm only a daughter of the technology. Yesterday my grandmother asked me what will I do without the computer. I answered to her saying I probably will die. ",31
973," Cracow 8430 Dear Competition Organiser, I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've planned already the rest of my summer holidays. On June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there. An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins. I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but I can't have it in  tent. I've also choosed two activities, swimming and sailing. These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water, but I like them more than surfing. At the end I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp.  Please answer me soon. Otto Zajac.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers, what is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much of time and health. Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there. In these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets  than at shops or even shopping areas, because shopping at  shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money. ",25
47," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited. First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great. It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from six countries. Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world. Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although, some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival. Another disadvatage of the festival's programme was  lack of plays and films which are the best  to display the modern county's culture. I suppose. I hope there will be more of them next year. I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced. In conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done. For example, the next year's one may last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for  greater amount of people. The programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs. Thank you for your kind attention. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Everybody wants to earn a bit of money. Especially young people who are always out of their small budget. Fortunatelly, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays. Of course, young people can work only in their spare time. It mean that a job should be part-time. So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish for example. Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy however. But you can earn more. Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday. But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may chose a more pieceful job of a typist at home. There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer. So, you can help them and earn quiete enough. To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in  Arctic. ",30
1009," Dear Pete, I hope you have a fantastic time in New York and please don't worry about your flat. Everything is going to be under control! But I want to make some points clear before you leave London. First of all, I think I'm going to be busy on the 4th of April. Can we change the date into the 5th of April, at 4 o'clock? Thanks very much for letting me use your things during the stay. I may need to use particularly the computer and the CD player. Is that OK for you? By the way, if you tell me around what time you will be back on the 20th, maybe I can prepare something for dinner. I know you're going to be too tired to cook after 11 hours of flight. Last of all, thanks for your consideration about bringing me a present. Anything as a souveniere would be quite enough for me. I'll leave it to you. I know you have a good taste in presents!! Have a great time in the States. Love,  [SEP]  To whom it may concern, With regards to your advertisement in ""The Traveller"" magazine, I would be pleased to tell you why I want to apply for this trip. The first thing that caught my attention in the advert was ""... eight people from different countries... "". I am very interested in meeting and spending time with people from other cultures. I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too. Obviously a sailing trip has not got the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting. I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real life and having friends from all over the world will help me to think ""worldwide"". I hope this letter will be enough to explain why I want to do this trip. Yours sincerely ",34
108," Santiago, June 17th, 200 Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I am very dissapointed with your musical show. I recently went to London on vacation, with some friends. We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was. If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one by the way. When our final day arrived, we went shoping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show. When we arrived, the were a lot of people, the pace was beatiful, all seemed perfect. When we entrance the place our problems begun. First, there were no discount on the tickets but that was fine. Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour, we deal with that too. After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us realy angry. But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed. I hope that you understand that I want my money back, or at least some of it, because this weren't my ""perfect evening out""  [SEP]  How has moden technology changed my daily life? I think that technology have change my life and everybodies life in many ways. Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, ofice or any place you can be in a city. This technology has help to made my life easier and more exciting, but like everithing   had some negative thing. This technology has help in many fields, like medicine, entreteinment, work and other thing, so it has obviusly change the life of many people. The bad things that this could have are unimportan, in comperison with all the good things this have done, so let's don't focus on the negative aspects of it. I think technology has become a part of our lifes, so we have to learn how to live in this new world, that is changing as fast as computers change. This is a new era, an era for a new tipe of people, the feuta people ",32
823," 14th June 2000 Dear Miss Ryan, I am really pleased to be the winner of your competition and I cannot help thinking about the two weeks in the USA. First of all, I would like to travel only in June given that my wife will come with me: her holiday are only in June. Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to live in  log cabins? Indeed, my wife is afraid of sleeping in tents. Moreover, I practice Basketball in a famous French Club: That is the reason why I would like to choose the Basketball. If I had to chose an other activity, I think I would do Photography. In fact, this activity seems to be very interresting. Unfortunately, I have never practiced but I feel to like discovering that. Finally, I would want to ask you whether we had to bring  money: Life is so expensive there! Furthermore, what sort of clothes must we have for the different activities? I hope my answers will satisfy you. I thank you again. Yours sincerely Tom Turner  [SEP]  After having thought about this video and asked different people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take  a great part in a day at school; this being in three parts. the morning That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all  students come in  class. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makes the film. Furthermore, as Mathematics are the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film  a time where we are in  MathClass the lunch After that  could come  the lunch which takes two hours per day. The better  to do would be to present the cooking personnal for they are very nice. the afternoon We could begin the afternoon with the sport, showing the different places with  surroundings (near the wild): it would give a good impression. I advise to finish with a lesson of Chemistry so that people see the laboratery. Before that, I would have showed the break at 3 o'clock which is important for us. ",24
387," Dear Manager I'm writing to complain about  poor administrations of your theatre. Because the advertisement for  show and the real show were completely different. First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on your advertisement but when I sat  my seat,  different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing for seeing them as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages. In addition, when I entered into the theatre I couldn't have  discount in spite of   student and I couldn't use in your restaurant either after the show. In that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. It's nonsense, wasn't it? Anyway, it was not ""My perfect Evening out"" but I think that it was a kind of ""contract infringement"" so I would like to ask for my money back. I look forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Of course, our life will be completely changed. However, we have to consider about our nature and human-being. First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now. All your stuffs will be performed by the computers. For example, if you watch ""The Star Trek"" - science fiction programme on TV, you will realise that you just can say ""Do it"" and then the computers will do it. However, there are some problems. If all your staffs are fulfilled by the computers, we might be idler than now. Moreover, we have to consider about our nature. As you know, even now, science and technology are destroying our environment, for example weird temperature etc. If we don't protect our environment, our daily life will not be convenient. Rather our daily life will be deteriorated. To sum up, future civilization is important for us. If there is no our good nature, our daily life will be unhappy. ",27
364," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you, because I would like to disagree with your advertisment for the show 'over the Rainbow'. I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I  your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was  totally different actor. As it is said in  advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because by the programme it started at 20.15, but that was not the end of the story, in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets, that was not true! I was not still very disappointed, because I hoped that I will have a good meal with  glass of wine in the restaurant,  according to your advertisment but what did I  realised, it was closed, because the chef was in the hospital. I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money back. Yours faithfully, Sasha Comatova.  [SEP]  Everyday we keep in touch with technology. We have microwaves that help us to do our meal quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that made our life easier. I use different technological things everyday. Such as  mobile phone that helps me to communicate, with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home, I use  stereo, if I want to listen to my favourite music, I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, ect. I think that all these things made my life much easier. Many years ago people didn't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot. I am very happy that with all  technology that we have we don't have to work as much as they did,  like to wash plates and cups after meals, my dishwashing machine will do that for me, and I don't have to wash my clothes my washing machine does it better. Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over  humans and of course it makes me lazy. However now I have more freedom, free time, and privacy. ",28
148,"  Mr. Jones, How are you? I'm not so well, and that's the reason why I'm writting this letter to you. Because you are the manager at the theatre, you have to know,  the problems which it has. First of all and the most important for me is that you lie to your audience. I didn't see anywhere Danny Brook, but another actor. That it was a big mistake. Unfortunatly your advertisment  said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later. Also there weren't any discounts. Oh! I as almost forget. You restaurant was closed because your cooker was ill. What can you say about that? So, that's why I'm asking you to give me, some of  money back. The perfect evening out I was waiting for, it was finally one of the most disappointed, of mine. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? That's a good question! I know that, each student gave its  different answers, but some of us will have some opinions. I think that, the big 'improve' of technology  the last 30 years helped and  still helping us a lot in our daily life. With T.V we can learn, what is going on all over the world. With the telephones, the aeroplanes,  even the fast ships there are no big distances any more. Eve summer I'm going with my family abroad. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer (  internet) I can speak with my friends, as far they are. All these may be sounds great, but they aren't all . With a lot of using of  T.V and computer, make people more close. You might not know your neighbour because all the time your  in the house. Children are not studying as much  they have to, because they are watching T.V, speacing on the phone or even playing computer games. That's why my marks this year were  bit low. And ofcourse my parents were very angry with me. This is also another reason of heard attacts. ",22
524," Mr Smith, Spending a week in London for holidays last week, I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really disappointed evening! Indeed, firstly, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15). Then, the actors (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) who were mentioned  and supposed to play weren't present. There were different actors who took the role. Thus, the musical show wasn't as good as it should have been. I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited  to see them. Furthermore, on the advertisement I got,  was written that the theatre restaurant was opened. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe spend a better evening than  at the begining  but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were indicated. As you can notice, my perfect evening I had supposed, was a nightmare; that's why I would please  you to give  my money back because I cannot tolerate such a thing!  [SEP]  From the begining of the century to now, modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier. Indeed, the modernism helps us to lead a confortable and better life than before. For example, cars, planes are a wonderful invention! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go to a city to an other one or to travel abroad. People couldn't think of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created. Human being became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands. The communication has made many progresses too. Everyone gets a television at home. ""A machine which talks and shows pictures!"" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago. Although there are new machines etc, the health makes many discoverts thanks to the searching on different diseases in order to make the population lived older. Thus, the modern technology seems to be a positive way in order to improve our daily life. ",22
874," Dear Helen, Thanks a lot for giving me the prize. I am so happy because of that. Thank you very much for treating me in that way. Appart from that, here you are the repplies that you asked me for: - concerning to the date: I can go in July because it's my holidays month. That was  my boss told me. - About the accomodation, as I read, you can offer me  log cabins or  tents. From my point of view, I think tents are better than log cabins, so please, could you accomodate me in a tent? - Activities: I am very keen on surfing because, where I live, I can pactice it every day. I also want to ""book in"" singing because I love singing very much and I am always singing in my house. Thank you so much for your attention. Yours faithfully Javi Fernández  [SEP]  Why don't you buy the green one? Oh, no! That's horrible, mum! This is one of a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are buying and getting clothes from the shelves. That is what most of the women love. They love going to a shopping centre and put lots of clothes on. That's so good when you have  money for joy it but, appart from that, there are many problems. On the one hand, a big problem are the children. When they go to shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that their sight reach: doors, little cars, films... but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, there are the children: crying because they are tired for shopping all the day. On the other hand there is a big problem: the mony. People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they arrives in their houses, they can see an empty wallet. So, do you believe that a shopping bag like this one is an enjoyable shopping day? ",24
1040," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the trip to London on the 13th, 14th and 15th March. Firstly, I would like to thank you very much for the good programme you have organised for my class. We are especially looking forward to join the river trip to Greenwich and  the sightseeing by bus. Secondly, I have seen an advertisement in the times about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be attended in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14. My class and I are all interested in it and we would like to go there to have a visit. It will be  great opportunity for all of us because they will show the latest fashion, the leisure and sports wear, the make up and the different hairstyles. Furthermore, the admission for students is free. I have alredy thought about a changing of the programme. On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time  doing shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we moved have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will take my proposal in favoreable consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. What was so dangerous and why I had to do it? Now I will tell you in brief what exactly happened to me. It was a fantastic sunny day of August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided to go to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lied on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing of me. So I took the decision to go and join them also if I knew that it would have been dangerous for my life. I walked very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends could understand that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided taking up swimming, so that I would have had no embarrass in the future trips to the seaside any more. ",35
1230," Dear Marie, I am writting in connection with your letter bout the international student conference. I appreciate if I can offer you my help. I would like to give you  necessary details, which can help you to organise the conference. Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students, which is a very comfortable and close to our college. You need only  5 minutes by walking to catch the college. After  conference we are planning to organise a big party with  barbecue. The party will take place on  forest close to  camping place. I hope we will have a nice weather. Therefore, I suggest to wear some casual clothes. On the last day  an afternoon if you have some free time I would recommend you to visit a very famous exposition of Leonardo Devinci. The exposition will take place on  ""Gribaldi museum"", which you can find on the Crariden street N 5. You will never regred about my suggestion. If you need more information let me knowe. Best regards,  [SEP]  Report on the building at the Berkeley Square. In order to prepare this report I visited the business college and interviewed some students, I asked them only one question ""Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city?"" The Students, who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City. However the majority of people point out one a very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square. Most of the Students found this building very particular, because it reflects our history, tradition and culture. If you visit the building, you will get  impression,  feeling, that you are in  past times. This building attracts a lot of people, - because it has a very particular style with majestic, antique windows. In addition, I also visited this place - and I was very impressed. Finally I would recommend you visited  Barkely Square area. In this area you could also find another different buildings, which would you attract. report on the group leader from 12.06.01 ",24
409," Dear Sir or Madam: I'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" that was held in your theatre. It was a very disappointing evening so I ask for my money back. The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full ticket. Another problem was that the show started 45 minutes late and I had a surprise when I saw that the main character was not played by Danny Brook, who is one of my favourite actors. Finally I want to complain about the theatre restaurant. We read that we could visit it after the show but it was closed because the waiters were on strike. I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking  my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Fashion news are followed by lots of people. We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now. But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now? People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for they daily life. I think that this tendence will not change but what will change is life. We tend to  a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it. Another important thing will be the use of technology. Scientists are looking for new materials that will made our clothes more comfortable  stronger. Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies and modern devices will be included in our daily clothes. Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected with technology and society. ",32
873," Dear miss Ryan, With reference to your letter of  13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me. I am pleased to provide you with the following information. Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July. I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor-sleeping really makes me happy. Concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it, for the second activity I would like to enroll  surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners group. I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that period of time, the kind of currency I should take with  as well as the vaccination requirements. I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your help. Yours faithfully Abril Botella  [SEP]  Benoni's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels, Belgium. It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computer, make up, languages, geographie to culture and civilization. Students start their day at the Gym, where they learn the importance of being fit, that is way I suggest to film this activity. Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life, depending on their levels  they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enables stuff to communicate with clients in a proper way, students have to manage to speak at least three languages. Another important lesson to film is ""culture and civilization, therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only, as  French say, ""pot-au-fleurs"", beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons. Last but not less important is the class called ""know-how"" wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress. I would also take an outdoor lesson ""training"". The school works together with known companies of the branch  as Mariot hotel, Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training. ",35
863," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter with congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need. First of all, I would like to start with the time of the travelling. I would prefer to go to the Camp on July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August. As regards accomodation, I would rather choose staying in tents. That is because I am keen on hich-hicking and I amused to living in tents. It is quite romantic, I think. As to the activities offered I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not quite good at the last one. Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure. As regards swimming, it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now. In the conclusion I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information. I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me. I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzeled about what to wear there. Besides, I would like to know how much money will I need and which expensies will I have to pay for by myself. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely XAVA SURGANOVA  [SEP]  Subject: to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about  daily life of our school. Introduction. The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see  watching the short videofilm about the daily routine of our school. The Area Around the School: I have made a little survey on the subject of my report and I have elucidaded that most of the pupils of our school consider that the region and the area around school should be filmed first. Personally I agree with their statement and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school. We should film our gardens around  school and a pitch with the playgrounds for volley-ball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning. Classrooms, Lessons and Breaks. Next things to be shot, by the majority of students was said to be the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the decoration of our classrooms and  atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been made during the last  years and all  modern conveniences that were made for both students and teachers. And as regards breaks student consider them being a very important part of school life, despite all their mess and noise. Outdoor Activities And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities, which our student are provided with in our school. We can make some short shots about the school theatre and it's performances and also about the sport-clubs and their competitions and awards. Conclusion In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey made among the students of our school. I hope you will consider this information.

766," Dear Miss Ryan, I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me on the letter. First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month  summer vacation that is in July. I appriciate it if it will be the first two weeks of the month. Next, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I need to have a time to relax when I travel. Therefore, I would prefer a log cabin. For activities, my first choise is basketball. I have been playing it since I was nine years old. In high school, I was in a school team and I enjoyed playing it with my team mate, even though we were not a strong team. My second choise is golf. I had never played it until last month. However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a biginner, so I would like to practice and have fun at the camp. Lastly, I would like to know whether I should bring some money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Thank you for giving me this great opportunity. I will be expecting to hear from you. Yours sincerely, Hideo Kojima  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I've got your letter yesterday. I enjoyed reading how you spent time with your family and had fun at the Park. Thank you. As I have told you, I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty, a local band in which one of my friends played guiter. He knew that I'd wanted to work at a concert hall, possibly as a lighting technician. So he suggested me to help  their concert so that I could know behind the scenes. When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought me to a room. He explained  me that it was to controll the light. It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights. However, when it came to the real concert, it was very hard. When the concert was finished, I was exhausted but happy. I'll write you back. Friend, ",27
1174," Dear Maria, I'm so happy to help you for this international student conference. I'm afraid for Richard. Could you please tell him my best wishes of  health? I'm sure  you can perfectly replace it to lead your group. At first, you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel that is one of the best in the town. The access to the conference place is very easy. First of all, you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop, then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college. After the conference, there is a great party that is organised by friends. It starts at twenty o'clock  until the end of the night, so be ready! There is no special thema for the wearing style but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy... Finally, I propose you to go to the new college swimmingpool on the last day   afternoon. Every body will go there. I hope you will have fun! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello, I will give you some informations on the yverdon's castle. This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town. I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developped around it since its creation. Those days, the castle is being remade, so there is a lot of construction engines around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries. There is a lot of old items that were in the King's family. You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years... You can see it in the dungeon. So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide. I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon. Best regards, ",27
1018," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you on the name of all the students who will go to the London's trip. First of all thank you very much for your programme, it's sounds very interesting and everybody is looking forward to it.  However, we do all have a request to ask you. We saw an advertisement about the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. This show is going on all day on March 14th. As teenagers we're all very keen on fashion so it will be a great opportunity to go because in our countryside, we'll never get a chance to see a show like that. What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th. Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show. Anyway, as students we don't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it won't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students. We hope you consider our request which would be very appreciate in the class. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Why  medias are so interesting in famous people? Because of us! I know that everyone is excited about what happened to Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of The United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit to far. Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character. In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe. ",27
996," Dear Miss Ryan, I'm writing to you as regards the letter you've sent me about the competition I've won. I've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it'll be an exciting trip. With regard to the date of the trip, July would be best because in June I'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins. I've never been camping before, I guess I'm not an outdoor girl, but I'd like to give it a try, so I'd rather tents than cabins. I'm really keen on sports, especially sailing. I've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly manage the rigging and sail. I'm also fond of tennis, I've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer. So, I think I'll do sailing and tennis. I'm not really sure of what kind of clothes to take, could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot. Sincerely, Diana Delgado  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy, we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us  stunningly beautiful. While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop. ",40
98," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing  you to complain about ,,Over the Rainbow"" musical show which took a place in The Circle Theatre several weeks ago. First of all,  advertisement for the shows provided absolutely WRONG information about  actors. Danny BROOK, who should play according  your advertisement was replaced by an another actor and it disappointed me. The show should start at 19.30, however, the audience have been waiting for fourty five minutes. Also, in the advertisement you have mentioned discounts which were not provided. The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I had not recieved the explanations why. On the whole, the evening was boring and disappointing. Based on everything listed above, I would like to recieve  £10, which I have paid, back. The ticket for the show is included. Look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has morden technology changed my life. New technologies have become the part of our lives. There are a lot of arguments about the weather this influence is negative or positive. Nevertheless, it has affected every person and hopefully in a good way. Personally, I consider modern technologies as a positive innovation. Using  microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time. Computer is extrrmely convenient in writing reports and essays. And, of course, I can not forget about cars and planes that deliver us to all parts of the Earth. However, many people, insist that new technologies affect people in a negative way. I would better prefer seeing my father talking to his family instead of staring at blue screen of TV. But also, I would not be able to imagine my life without the nice way of reciving news with help of it. Counting  pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points in working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway. Modern girl or boy already would not be able to imagine life without them. ",27
526," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show that has recently taken place at the Circle Theatre. The advirtisement I had read did not match the performance. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring and was replaced by a different actor. That was very disappointing. The performance started fourty five minutes later. Moreover, I was unpleasantly amazed  no discounts were available. Furthermore, I would not have complained if the theatre restaurant had been open. According to the advertisement, I could visit it after the show, but it was closed because of the lack of customers. My ""perfect evening out"" was not so perfect and could not satisfy me in any way. From my point of view, the partial refund of the cost of the tickets, which are enclosed with this letter, would completely satisfy my interests. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Modern technology has  variety of uses and its possibilities are being widened more and more. Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticable. Personally I feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers. Their popularity could be explained by their comfort and easy use. With the help of  ""Internet"" it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in. Computers take  the major part of my free time and this is the reason of disagreements between me and my parents. They would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily routine. I am completely satisfied with the way I spend my freetime, but they have another opinion. In conclusion, modern technology affects everybody, but in different ways. The only effect on me is more often disagreements with my parents. ",29
122," Mr. Circle Theatre's Manager I am writing to you complaining for the Play you are advertising as the ""London's Newest and Best Musical Show"" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience in my whole life. I cannot bear  when somebody says something and then does just the opposit way. To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says . What is more it lasted 45 minutes of waiting  to start and  did not supply all the expectations people had. On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all. Instead of him there was another actor who  neither act nor sing, and, even though, it was a Musical Show. The last thing I would like to complain for is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed because, as it said, of ""VACATIONS"". If in the advertisements and leaflets says ""VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW"" there are not reasons for  being closed. It should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place. It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there, or not. To make it shorter, because of everything I have said before, the correct thing to do for me is to ask for my money back, and for you  is just giving it back to me because of all the troubles and disappointings feeling you made me suffer. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY LIFES In times of our grandparents life was so different, that we cannot beleive that this huge change to our day life happened in only one hundred years or less. First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication, traveling and geting information. You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time  it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the ""enter"" key in a computer. Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every  machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly. One the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because  is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has. With advantages and disadvantages, technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others. Things and technology changes every day our life, our jobs, our way of face the world, this is what differences both centuries, our grandparents' changes lasted to long to change human life. ",23
433," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because I went to The Circle Theatre some days ago and I regret to inform you that it was not a good experience. According to the advertisement Danny Brook was the male actor. However he did not act, and his sustitute was not very good at acting. Secondly I had problems with both tickets and time. The play started at 20:15 instead of 19.30. Furthermore I could not get a discount although I think I was entitled to it. (I have a special youth card). In addition the theatre restaurant was not available because of the waiters' strike. In conclusion, not only my evening was horrible but also expensive. That is why I ask you for refunding my money, or at least part of it. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie (Accident) Dear Nigel, I was pleased to hear from you last week. Now I am writing to you because a story of Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. Its title is ""Accident"" I know you are interested in the author and I think you'll like the story. Firstly the main character is Evans, a retired police captain. He is not as well-known as Poirot or Miss Marple, but his personality it quite interesting. I am sure you'll agree with me. Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it catchs your attention since the first moment. Finally, you should pay attention to the ending which is surprising. I hope you will spend a good evening listening to the radio. The story is going to be read next Friday at 8.00 p.m. Have a good time and write soon. Love, ",35
767," Dear Mrs Ryan, Referring to the won competition, I would  say that I am very happy to be the first. Accordingly I will give you the further information that you wanted. First, you asked abut the travel time and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holidays  in this period. Second, I prefer accommodation in  tent. I want to feel the real nature and spirit of Camp California. Further more, I should choose between two activities and  how good I am at each one. I choose singing and surfing, singing because I am a singer in a band and I hope to make my voice more perfect and surfing because I have never surf and I want to learn to. Finally, I have some questions. I would  know what type of clothes I should bring with me? How much money should I take with me? Is it possible to travel with a friend of mine? Yours sincerely Marlene Berg  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I hope  fine. Me, fine, because of helping at the concert  'The Dome'. I can say that this was one of the best experiences of my life. First I have help to cook coffee and make food for popular people like Mariah Carey, Elton John, Backstreet Boys, Echt ect... Before and after the concert the ""stars"" are very hungry and I have serve them food, drinks and something like this. Kim, check it in your mind, I have had near contact with Mariah Carey! I am so happy about it. Different ""stars"" gave me signatures and talk really nice and normal with me. At the time the concert was running I cleaned the kitchen and the room where the ""stars"" ate. The after show dinner party was very nice and I have never thought that popular people like Elton John dances on the table if he likes the music and if he have made a great show on stage. It was just great and after this event I can say that popular people are normal humans like everyone ! Love, Marlene ",24
847," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure. Firstly, the date I would like to travel on would only be in July. Since I am a full-time student, I will not have finished my lessons until the end of June. In addition, I will be busy with my cousework in August. Regarding to the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to the nature. I am sure I will have a lot of fun and release myself from the busy study totally. I am pretty good at painting. I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college. On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six. Tennis is my favourate sports evant. So I would like to choose these two activities while I am at the Camp. Lastly, I have some questions to ask you. Since I have never been to  U.S.A, I know nothing about it. Would you like to tell me how much  should be taken with me as pocket money and what shall I wear at that time ?  I will be grateful for your help. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it. However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO. Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt? Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable? More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style in this new generation! ",36
682," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I am really pleased hearing from you, I won the prize. So I can go camping for two weeks. It must be great. As regards your questions, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to  U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in the tent. So exciting! And I would like to have chances to play tennis and go swimming. In  case of swimming, I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis before 3 weeks. However, I am very enjoying playing tennis. Further, I have a question. Actually I have never gone camping so I really have no idea about that. I wonder which clothes are suitable for your camping. And How about the money? Do you think if there is some occasions to spend money or not? I am really expecting going camping Yours sincerely JAE KWAI ",12
949," Dear Mrs Ryan, I'm writing to give you the information you requested in your letter dated March, 31st, in which you informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has accepted my holidays on that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible. Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  log cabins. I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days. It's difficult for me to chose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball. I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport. I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy. I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional information. What type of clothes must I take? Is it necessary to take dressed cloth for any formal events? Must I take cash money or can I use the credit cards? Thank you in advance for your help. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your last letter. I can understand why you are impatient to hear about my experience at the concert last month. I have met our favourite singer, Celine Dion! She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert. We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed . Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert. And then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her  an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me! I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph. Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D. Let me know if you are going to come so that I  prepare the bedroom to put you up . Please, come! Best wishes, ",33
77," Dear Ms Clark, I am very glad to write to you. I spent two days at the International Arts festival you organised. I enjoyed most of the events I went to, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. Here are some opinions and suggestions: Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries. Additionally, some concert halls were too small to relax , while most of them were very comfortable. It was a pity for me that there were fewer plays and films than I had expected. I suggest to you that you should organise more next year. On the other hand, there were a lot that impressed me very much. For example, there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. It is a very good way to increase the number of music-lovers. Last but not last, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year. I enjoyed it very much. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Long long ago, there lived in a province of Bizen in Japan an old woman and an old man. They were eagar to have a child, but they had never been able to. One day, the woman went to the riverside, and found a peach floating in the river. She brought it to her house, cutting it  with her husband. To their surprise, there was a boy in the peach! They named him Momotaro, and looked after him. The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures. He made up his mind to defeat them, and asked his stepmother for some kibidango, one of traditional snacks in Japan. Having eaten the kibidango, he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him: a dog, a monkey and a bird. Reaching the island, he and his friends fought bravely against the devils. They finally succeeded n defeating the devils, and took back all the money and treasures. After that, they went home. All the people in Bizen including his stepparents met Momotaro and his friends with a great joy. This story happened a long time ago. ",31
1007," Dear John! I was very happy to receive your letter. I haven't heard from you for a long time, how are you? How is your sister, Marine? I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable. We were also very lucky with the weather, it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long. I think you should definetly go and I'll try to help in what I can. First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions. I think you should take  packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle). I advise you to try  watersports as well, it's a real laugh. I'm not sure how many students are there in your class but they give reductions for groups  over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you. By the way, I'd love to come with you, if it's possible! I really enjoyed our trip and I'm eager to see you again! Looking forward to your reply, Love  [SEP]  TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day, unable to press the ""Off"" button on the remote control. Some say it's evil, it spoils our eyes and personality, others say it's useful, enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality. But can each one of these people answer one simple question! ""Could you live without television for a week?"" I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived  three weeks in a complete TV vacuum, I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings. You might ask me a normal question ""What about  news?"" Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers? And the radio (if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them to be read to you!) The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say ""no"" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more. ",40
1053," Dear Mr. Robertson, I, as a head member of the students who participate in this year's trip to London, would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have developed for us. Specially, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries all around the world. Being London one of the most multicultural, multiracial cities, we cannot avoid the fact that is these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall (Tuesday March 14th) 10:00-19:00.). Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes in the fabulous Programme you have offered. These changes will not affect the contacts of the programme itself. The suggestion is to move the Tuesday shopping to Wednesday afternoon, which is free, and place there the visit to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, that is, on Tuesday afternoon. I also would like to remark that this change does not increment the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students. I want to thank you Sir for your time. Best Regards, The London Trip Group  [SEP]  ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is knocking at your door every day. It was 20 years ago  we were friends since  10. In those days we decide to be friends forever and work for the NASA. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done. The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas). Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it so. So, that, we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results. This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university. The task was not easy, with 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there was nothing to lose. It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding all our fingerprints. The operation was successful. Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system and new encryptation algorithms. ",30
41," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, I am writing with reference to the International Arts Festival  I have recently been to and I would like to give you my opinions about it. According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there were stars and artists from around the world; but they were only from six countries. In addition to this some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there fro the occasion and, personally speaking  the show could be done at the open air next year, so that  music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around. Plays and films had a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it. The other events I went to, dance shows, art exhibitions and talk by writers, were well organised and extremely interesting. Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was  excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part to the Festival. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear George, I'm writing to answer your question about  rules in my life, at school and at home. As you may know, I attend a Liceo, which is the most difficult kind of high school in Italy. Our teachers are very strick, we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down!,,. We can't talk during lessons and we only have a en minutes break at 10.30 a.m. If we're late, we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature  to go to class. It's hard to be extremely quite for five hours but I reckon it's a good way of education. On the other side, I feel free at home. I help doing  cleaning or the washing, but I do it because I want to, not because my parents make me do it. I can go out and stay out late, I've got my car and my mobile, so that they can call me whenever they need to hear me; but above all I know they trust me and consider my an adult. Therefor I wouldn't change anything in my home life and neither in my school life. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. ",33
234," Dear sir, I'm sorry to tell you, that I'm really disappointed of your advertisment for the musical show in the Circle Theatre. First of all, I was really looking forward to see one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, what disappointed me very much. Also, the show didn't start in time, it started half an hour later. And you have written in your advert, that there would be discounts available, what wasn't possible this evening. After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of  painting-works inside the restaurant. Finally we had no  perfect evening at all! And  of these circumstands, I would like to have a part of my money back. I hope you understand my concern. Yours Faithully, Brigitte Beschle  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because he likes to tease people. So, it was last summer, we were on a short trip with our class to a adventure-park. We had a lot of fun. Until we came to a big cave, where you could walk through. It was quiet scary for me, but I said to myself, come on you can do it. I walked  first with Pat and two of my friends. But suddenly, there were only Pat and I left. We lost the others. So I tried to get not in  panic, but  no chance. I was so worried  not to find the way out, that I started to scream and cry. First, Pat started to laugh, but as he realized, that I didn't stop crying, he comfort me until I was calming down. And after a while we found the way out. I ask him, not to tell anybody that I cried. He said, 'shure no problem'. But next day, back in the classroom, some of the students looked at me and started to laugh. After that  was all clear, Pat and secrets. ",27
1037," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you liked it. We are very grateful to you for these three days that we are going to spend in the English capital, especially because you planned very interesting and different kinds of things to do for all  us. However, all we agree that we would like to introduce a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show in the Central Exhibition Hall of London in the trip organisation. I am sure that, if you allow us to go, we are going to enjoy it a lot, to learn new topics about the English culture and have an opportunity to communicate ourselves with all those professional of the fashion. It is a very good chance to join this exhibition to see all the new fashion tendences, the latest hairstyles and make up as all  we came from many different countries and have not the same customs either. And another important thing to consider is that for the students the tickets are free. As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of doing shopping in the afternoon. By this way, we would visit the museum as you had planned and n Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished it. Well, that is all I wanted to tell you. We do hope you like our suggestion and we can have an agreement to join the fashion exhibition. Yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  Do famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time? Some people think that they should. They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lifes to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to go out home  not to be recognised.. This is supposed to make them happier... Nevertheless, if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of the people, if they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity, a popularity which has given to them by all us. So they need to become famous to be what they want and if the people don't know them, they are forgotten, they die... To sum up I would like to say that for me  is very difficult  which group has the reason but, by the moment, we should try to respect each other and go in the other's soul to feel like them in those moments we cannot understand them.

624," Hello! My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition. Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office for experience. I hope, that's possible. I would prefer living in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is more natural. A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday. It sounds like a summer-holiday at the beach of Italy. From the activities  I want to take Golf and Surfing. Both activities I've never done in my life, so I am a complete beginner in playing Golf and in Surfing. But the reason I want to try these two activities are their image. Golf play the wealthy people, the upper class of a town, and surfing sounds like freedom. There is only one more question I want to ask: Can I take my girl-friend with me, of course with paying? I hope all my wishes are realizeable. Yours  [SEP]  In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only  a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing! ",31
575," June 5, 2000 Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am writing this letter because I would like to express my happiness. This is the first time I won a prize in these kind of competitions so I would like to clear some doubts. First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work  and my parents wish to see me in this month, so if it is possible to arrange the date it would be very nice. Second, I use to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer if it is possible to be in  tents, because it would be a original experience . Third, I love playing basketball, I am a great player and I play with my University and I like to be playing all the time so this activity I will not missed. The other activity would be surf. I think  is very cool and I want to learn. Finally, I want to know what kind of clothe I will need and if have to take  money for shops or markets. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly, Jason Andre.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. You have to be all the time walking, so your legs will feel pain, hurted at the final of the day, you will be very tired and you would want to hang around for two months. If I go alone  is very fast and I enjoy it but if I go with my mother it would be horrible, I will have to do a sacrifice. I will have to be waiting until my mother decides which is the best place to buy her dress. She will see if it is pretty or not, if it is in discount at other store we will not buy the dress and we will have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but at the final of seeing all the stores and looking  all the dresses she will decided for the first  we saw. It is horrible. Is like a nightmare. ",18
1024," Dear Mr Robertson, On behalf of my class, I am writing to request  few changes in our London programme which has already been planned. My friends have seen an advertisement which is  the London fashion and leissure show. it will be held on 14th March. We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions, make up,  hairstyles instead of going to do shopping. We would suggest gong to this fabolous show. it is also free of charge for students. We will be given a great opportunity to have fun and look around in London. We would all thank you for the organised programme. I apologise  any inconvenience that this cause you. We would be pleased if you could make a new arrangement in your programme I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincererly,  [SEP]  CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW YOUR HOUSE? We spend most of our life in our houses. We like them show our life style and of course feel ourself comfortable. I can imagine in the future how it would be? It would be much  technological or far less complex. it could be as simple as we think. but the imagine of the life style depends on  person. On the other hand, it would not be changed. Somehow I could say that the main appliance would remain the same working structure. it only just might be changed the design of things such as a triangular talking oven. Despite being used in many ways, it could entartian us as well. On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier. to live. I wouldn't mind having things talking to around me. it would be enjoyable to have virtual friends in my house. Although I imagine   my house in my future, I am sure I would be suprised when I had them. ",19
820," Dear Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for your first prize in your competition two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would be grateful to except this prize. As you said, you need some further information. First of all, I would like to travel in July, at present, I am doing an art course at college. So I won't be able to have a holiday until then. I would rather stay in log cabins than tents. I have some pain on my back therefore I can't sleep in the sleeping bag on the ground. Furthermore, I would love to do Basketball and Painting activities while I am at the Camp. I am a member of  college Basketball Team which became the best Basketball Team of last year. Secondly, I want to do painting which I am really interested in and as a student of Art College. Lastly, I would like to learn that what kinds of clothes I have to bring with me and how much money (American currency - dollars) I'll need to have while I'm there. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I would like to thank you for your letter which I received yesterday and I wanted to reply as soon as possible. I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month. As you know, our college was chosen to be there and help the singers and the musicians out. When I first arrived there I was pretty nervous and excited. My friends and I have been taken to the backstage where we met the members of West Life, Elton John and Robie Williams. I even go a bunch of flowers from them with a ""thank you"" letter. What we all did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings. What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties. I particularly liked listening  their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violen etc. Which was unbelievably great and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want. Lots of love, ",32
657," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you to give you some further information about the competition I won. I am very pleased that I won your competition. First of all I would like to travel in July because I already made an arrangement with my boss about my free days. I would prefer to sleep in an log cabin. I am not just to sleeping in an tent and I think it mabey ruen my holiday. I hope it's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it's not, you can also put me in an tent. The two activities I would like to choose are: Photography and Surfing. Photography I never realy took  pratice in, yes I have made some holiday pictures but I would like to learn more about this. So I am not very good in Photography. Surfing is my passion. I live nearby a beach and whenever I have the time I grape my bord and go surfing. I would like to have a surfing contest with other surfing nerds, if it's possible. I would like to know if I have to bring my own wetsuit for surfing and how much money do you think I need? I am realy looking forward to this holiday. I hope I have informed you enough. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm doing great esspecially after my experience with helping at  pop concert. It was fantastic. You also would have liked  very much. I had to help back stages. I had to take care of that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone elses. Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted. The realy thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost. That was a good feeling for me. I had to tell them when they had to go on stages. What kind of clothes they shoot wear. I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous. The thing I realy liked, was helping the artists and talking to them. Oke, they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert. Afterwards they talk to me and thanking me for helping them in those exciting moments. I realy got to know them after the concert. They also took me to a after hour party and they asked me if  would like to do this again. And of course I immediately said Yes!! Mabey next time you can come with me that would be a lot of fun. The will call me next week, so I write when I talk to them. Talk to you soon. love ",29
725," Dear Ms Ryan I am very astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I will say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California already. I have never been in California yet. Now I will give you the further information: I have to travel in July because I had to make sure that I can have  holiday this year and it is the only possebility! I am sure you can take attention on this. I decided to have the accommodation at Camp California  in a tent, because there you will have lots of fun. You can feel the fresh air and listen to  animals, this will be a great oportunety! I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am not well in both activities, but it will be a pleasure to try it espacially surfing, I would like to feel the air in my hair, and enjoy how quick the board goes over the sea. Another question I have; the live there, is it as expensive as I think? And the weather are they only sunshiny days? In the other hand it is not as important, the main reason is I really look forward to go at this Camp and one more time, thanks a lot! Yours sincerely L. Schwartz  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement, we have had a great  argueing. Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home, to wear, but mostly you will have allways not enough. When I decided to go for a shopping, first I will make sure that I have enough time. I am not a typical women because I hate shopping! I am lucky if I will find something which fits. The main reason I hate , there are too many people who are always standing in my way (or maybe I think in that way) and I begin to be angry, normally I am looking those people with evil eyes! I mean, it is too crowdy, you have to wait such a long time before you can pay, and mostly all the things are too expensive! Even before you will find a color you like or the right size of the trousers, you were looking for it a long time, has gone! Lastly, you can see, my opinion about shopping is not very good, then I think shopping is never enjoyable! ",28
689," Dear Miss Helen I have just recived your letter and I'm very happy for it, especially becouse the competition was so hard. Being at Camp California was one of  dreams of my life and now I can relaized it. Firstly, I could to pass this two weeks during next July only, because, before and after it, I have to working as a waiter here in my town. However, about accommodation, I'd prefer a log cabin, becouse it is more confortable than the tent. All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing, because I'm used to playing tennis during every weekends and I'm very keen to surfing. I'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too. Lastly, I'm interested about the law's schools in California, they are very famous here. I would like to know if I will visit at least one of them. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim This is a precise letter that I write  you now. I'm very happy and lazy at the same time. Last month I visited Tom, another old friend, and he told me if I had worked with him like  musician at the XZY pop concert. ""This is extraordinary"", I said. Firstly, I was very embaracing during the concert, but all the staff were very kindly with me and Tom too. This is the most important experience in my life, I knew all the people, in a particular the famous singer ""Kos"". He is funny and easy-going. During the concert, I was near the  and opposite there was ""Pipe"" the biggest  of the world. It's very difficult describing all  emotion I felt. I can only tell  that  had been an important experience for me and for my new songs. Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I obn't be able to write oben this letter yet. I hope to hearing  you soon Your best friend ",25
562," Dear Madam, I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition and I can go to the United States. It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country. Now my dream will come true. I will try to give you some information about me. The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then I can have holidays. I would be pleased if it is possible. About accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in the tent and I would like to try it. It will be very interesting for me because normaly I have not a lot of time to do activities. I would prefer swimming because I very like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time, and painting because I have finished  painting course and I have some practice with this. That is very nice that every costs are paited for but I would like to ask you how much money I should to take with me because I do not now anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please to tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activite. Thank you for the letter and I am looking forward  an answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hallo Kim, Thank you for answer on my last letter, I hope your sister's health is better than on last time and she is all right.

It was  realy wonderfull new experience for me. I have never before met so many people and I didn't now that is so hard to keep everything in order during the concert.

I will never forget this concert and those people. It was good experience which I will never forget. I hope I will be able to do it again. ",24
51," Dear Jane Clark, The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend. I believe that the event was good, however I feel that the festival can be improved next year. Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries. I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet  other personalities. Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy  concerts because some concert halls were too small. I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year. Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly. I hope you find my opinion useful. Once again congratulations on the Festival. I hope to hearing from you soon yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  tips  to earn money When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us. there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time. One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it doesn't require special skills, all you need is a lot of patience. If looking after children doesn't fit you, you can try  with pets. Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk. So if you like animals this is your chance to earn  money and have fun at the same time. Another option is to wash your neighbour's car. In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with, but don't worry, soap is not very expensive. the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you, according to the things you like to do. If you don't find anything good enough for you don't worry, you should always remember: It's not all about the money! ",35
301," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to you to complain about the musical show, wich everything was completely different from the advertisement. Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains I can start with the actor -  was a different one , not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous, but him I think he is a ""street actor"" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that drove me mad. I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for  discount ticket, I could not get it, it was really unfair, I paid  normal price. Also there was another problem, I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not,  was closed because it has been refurbished and redecorated. Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out however I had just a terrible time, everything went wrong. The only thing to do is: to compensate me, send  my money back, I am sending my ticket for that: Hope you'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Márcia  [SEP]  ""Techno life"" Twenty first century - technology, technology, and technology. Modern life it has been full of science and tecnologies. I am very pleased that I  born under such good tecnologies like my parents didn't have the same luck. My life is much easier with all these stuffs above mentioned - tecnology and science. Computers have changed people's life, many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices.  Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny. There is  ambiguity about technology -  can bring good things and terrible things as well. One good side is  making life easier - computer, mobile phones, vending machines, etc.... The bad side is   to use tecnology for war - missiles, weapons, etc.... Indeed tecnology has changed our lives, we have become more scepitical and cold. I believe that people should take just good advantages that. Sometimes I think tecnology is not a good thing.... ",24
97," 59 Gorham Drive St Albans AL1 2HW 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show of ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw on 15th of June in your theatre. Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20:15. As for the ticket price, you promised to provide discount tickets, but they were not available. Furthermore, when I went to the restaurant after the show, I found it was closed. Because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00. I do not need to tell , either, that I had  awful evening and you are responsible for that. So I am asking  to refund all the money. Thanking  for your prompt attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Faithfully Tyung Kwa (Miss)  [SEP]  THE REVOLUTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY I am checking my e-mail everyday using the Internet, I am talking to my friends who is far away  connecting to network systems, and I am taking my mobile phone. For recent years, as Information Technology has been improved highly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not  same as before. A few years ago, I did not know what  Internet was, how to use it and so on. But, while those have been spread all over the world, I and all the other people who I have known became to use them. I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to  library. I am able to meet my friends quickly in  Internet  just clicking the mouse. In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who I want to talk  at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed. It is causing some changes to me. So, now I would rather send the e-mail than the letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster. ",29
1107," Dear Mr Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London. Especially the sightseeing by bus seems to be very interesting. But we would like to suggest you something: There is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear; make up and hairstyles on the 14th of March. It is called ,,The London Fashion and Leisure Show."" This would be a great opportunity   because we are all intrested in clothes, sports and fashion. I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students! Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum. The show lasts nine hours, from 10.00-19.00, the whole day! Our question now : Could we go to this show? We could maybe change Tuesday's programme to Wednesday. We all prefer   the show, free time is not so important for us. Please think about this and give us an answer. Thanks. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Jack Thanks a lot for your letter. I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams. Therefore I read Agatha Christie's ,,Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". I can really recommend you this book, it is fabulous. It is also a suitable present for your cousin, I think. One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island. There is a storm and they can not leave. Suddenly a murderer happens! Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery. But I will not tell you  more. You have to read it yourself. And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book! Unfortunately it is quite expensive, £32. But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it! Okay, I hope to have news from you very soon. Have a good time. Yours sincerely, ",37
742," Dear Mrs. Ryan, thank you very much for your letter. It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition, which means that I will have the possibility to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me. As request following you will find the information you need . First, I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for  holiday at that period and it would suits me very well. Secondly, I would prefer an accomodation in  tent because I enjyoi being outside close to the nature. Thirdly, what the activities concern, which I can choose, it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them! As I am very good at tennis and swimming I will choose these. I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad. and I am able to swim  every style. Finally, I have two questions. Please let me know which clothes do I need then and how much money in cash and as travellers cheque shall I take with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely E. Elmo.  [SEP]  Sometimes the bad charachters in a story are more interesting than the good ones. I completely agree with this statement. Recently I have red a short story written by Agatha Christie. His title was: ""The Mistery of Hunter's Lodge"". The charachter which I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering, the mistress. It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people: herself and the houskeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it. I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him. She was the head in this story. The plan was almost perfectly and the police hadn't discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot. In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense. Moreover she must have had an ""ice blood"" and strong nerves to handle  in that way. As far as I am concerned I would appreciate to have myself some of her characteristics, like take a decision and handle. ",30
656," Dear Miss Helen Ryan, Thank you for informing me that I have won the first prize in your competition. I am writing to give you some of my information and I would like to have some further information on the camp in California. Firstly, I would like to start my journey on the second week of July because I will have a 3 weeks holiday in July. I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months. As for the accommodation I would like to stay in a log cabin because I hate sleeping in the tents. I stayed in a tent once when I had my Duke of Edinburgh walk. I felt really uncomfortable in the tent. Secondly, I would like to have a chance to do singing and swimming while I am  the Camp. I am keen on singing and I have won sevral singing competitions at school. I have chosen swimming because it is my favourite sport. I enjoy doing it very much. I note that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but does it include my expenses in California? Lastly, I would like to know what the weather in California  likes and which type of clothes I have to bring. Would it be possible for you to send me a map of california so I know where the camp site is situated? I would be grateful if you could send me some information. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  Annabel Koh  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? How are you getting on with your school work? Do you enjoy your schoollife? As you know I had a wonderful experience in last month so I am writing to tell you . I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entred the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert was started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert. I had a really good time in this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is? I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully ",36

241," Dear, Sir/Madam I am Writing this letter to say my dissatisfaction of your entertament. Last week I was on holiday and I went to The Circle Theatre to see over the rainbow musical. I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musical and also I like Danny Brook. However, the reading actor was not him! Of course, I was so disappointed. The actor was not famous for his acting. Also the musical did not start on time, it was late thirty minuts. We just sat on the seat and nothing to do. I was going to a restaurant with my friends after the musical, but the musical finished at ten thirty. It was too late and we could not have a dinner. If the musical had started on time, we could have eaten in the restaurant. Fathermore, discounts was unavailable. Even though we had a student card. In the advertisement they said that tickets discounts  available. I think it  a bombastic. Anyway I was so unpleasement. It was not  marvellous evening. Could you back my money please? You have  responsoiblity for the audiences. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? My life have been changed by technological improving. Nowadays. We have so many technological things. For instance, TV, computers, telephone, air-conditionings. These things are very convinience on the other hand, there  lots of disadvantage point. I have my own TV in my room and I enjoy watching TV everyday. However, I need balance. If I watch TV too much I might not speak to my family  often. It will lack of communication. In addition, it is difficult turn it off. I think I should cut down  watching TV. Sometimes it  waste of time. What about computers? It is very useful too. I am living in London, but my father lives in Taiwan and my mother lives in Tokyo. I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone. Unfourtunately it is not so cheap. If I use e-mail  much easier and cheaper. And I can send e-mail anytime. If I  addicted on  internet, it will be  problem. I do not want to spend much time with computers. In conclusion. people include me need balance. We must be good at using computers. ",25
86," Dear Sir, Last week I stayed in London for  holidays. During my stay in that beautiful city, I thought it was a good idea to go to the theatre to enjoy a Musical show, so I decided to go to your theatre to see ""over the Rainbow"". It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who was in the theatre. First of all, I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement. In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m. but, in fact, it began at eight fifteen. I also, found out that no discounts were available. In spite of it was said in the advertisement . Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker has had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables. In the advertisement there's no mention about getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give it back to me. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village in the southern cost of Spain with my friend Pat. We usually went to the beach to have a bath and to enjoy the fantastic whether in that part of Spain during the summer. One day we found out a beautiful little beach next to the big one where some people were taking a sunbath and some children were playing football in the sand. At it was so beautiful, we decided to come back to the beach at night to see the moon, the see and the stars. When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two persons doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, at the end, we saw that they had robbed a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell it to anybody. It was our secret. Unfortunately Pat explained the story to a friend of us and I don't know how, but the robbers knew that we had seen all they had been doing. So, now we are in danger because of that. ",26

Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not a good company, we usually don't have a great time, or when we know what we want to buy, but when we get to the store they don't have what we want, in that moment we neat to shop also when is an important day like Father's day or christmas every where we want to go and buy something  is very crowd so we can't find what we are looking for with calm because everybody is pushing you to the other place that you want to go In that cases is when we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center.

720," Tuesdy 13th, June, 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition. I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month. About accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins, because I have a problem in my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not fairly comfortable. As far as camp activities  concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing. On the other hand, I  keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it. Finally, I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California? In addition, could you advice me how much money I need for the trip? and is there anything else do I have to know? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  13/06/00 Hello Kim, I've received your letter two days ago and I'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I'm ok and let me tell you about my last experience. I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me  an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it. He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while. I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very simply. I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail. Well my friend, I have to go, because I  got an appoinment with the Dentist. Write  me soon and take care. Best wishes ",22
248," Dear Sir, Being on a holiday trip in London, I dreamed  to go to the theatre for a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought ""It is that one that I want to try."" In fact, your musical show was attractive: actors, time, restaurant, discount tickets, and also the title! I started to be OK with the ""Your perfect evening out"", sure  not  to be deceived. But all was disappointing! First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised  he totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the scene! Second bad point: beeing not narrowminded, I accept other actors.. but  if the show begin on time - he began at a quarter past eight P.M. There were no discount places because it was not planed like this by the theatre. What was written on the advertisement? The summum was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for ""holidays"". I was terribly ennoyed! I spent the worse evening of my holiday in this show! So I need now a ""perfect - money back -"" for replacement of your ""perfect evening out"". I do hope you will accept and understand this request. Yours:  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" First of all, ""daily life"" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. Up to two years ago, I was working with a written booknote or agenda, and I used to phone with a wired phone system. Nowaday, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that authorizes me to connect to  Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get informations and electronic mails. I am always joinable with my mobile phone, that is also sometimes boring! Being in an apprenticeship, I go  both work and university. At the university, I have learned with computer aided systems. I often go on  Internet to find informations for studying a precise subject more accutely (university technology sites). At work my personal job uses two standard PC with specifical softwares plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a particular computer that my firm is developping now. At home, I have got a personal computer for my mails and accounts, and electronic mail plus  internet for keeping connected to my friends that are at the other end of France or Germany, Korea and so on. So modern technology has totally changed my daily life! ",31

Pleas apologise me, but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made, which disappointed me very . I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor  play in that show. And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage. Please, if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake. I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 not on 19.30. Other thing was that there was no discounts available, and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sikness. I would be very grateful if I could get my money back. That evening which should be my perfect evening out, was in fact very tireing and boring. Apologise me for disturb. I am looking forward for  answer! Best regardes!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, I knew that he's  very talkative person, but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday party for tenes. It started a week before that day. Pat found the great place for the party called ""Blue Box"". I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign ""Do not tell Agatha about that, this is a suprise party for her, please keep the secret!"" Pat arranged  great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breath taking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in  disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exaiting!!! We put off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard ""What the hell is going on?!!"" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR! She was so touched that we started to cry. Enyway the disco was great, music also. We had fun to 5 o'clock! Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever get! ",22
6," Dear Mr Jane Clark, My name is Rosa Santor. I'm 24 and I'm  student from Poland. I study architecture at the Polytechnics in Krakow. I'm very interested in art, specially in paintings and goings to galleries. I'm writting you a letter, because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival. I recently spent two days at this festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that  festival could be even better next year. It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion if this is an international festival, it would has more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like it was this year. It was  great idea for doing something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hall were too small for all  people, who took a part at that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also  a great idea was, that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. I think, as a person, who in this festival took place in, that this is excellent, because we can spend a lot of time with art. There is only one bad fhing, that this festival was too short. In my opinion next year it should take place  much longer than two days. I'm not looking foward to received  letter from you, because I know, that you are busy, but please look at my suggestion for next year's festival. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kathleen, I've been just receiving this letter for you, so I'm writting  you. I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years. You wrote that in your class, you've been talking about rules, both at home and at school. So now, I would like you write something about  school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. As you know I'm not a secondary school's student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Sathurday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there are a lot of drawings,  paintings and some other subjects doing by hands. We also learn how to design the interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons at the morning, till  afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all  class, for example next to the lake, and there we are paintings the nature. I don't have troubbles with my education, my friends and teachers are nice and friendly, but there is one thing I'd like to change in my school. I'd like to have more tests during the whole study, not only at the end, because it causes that I'm getting very lasy. I'm looking forward to received a new letter from you. I think, that you don't forget, & will write  me soon. See you soon, your best friend ",25
935," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I won a competition. It is the first time it happens to me. Unfortunately I'm free only in July. Actually I will be busy working abroad until the end of June and will be on holidays with my family in August. You asked me which accomodation I would prefer. It's ages since I have been sleeping in a tent and I would be happy to experiment it again. It will remind me  some wonderful experiences. According to the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at. The second activity I chose is sailing. I went two times on a sailing ship without doing anything, therefore have I got no experience at all. May I ask you how much money do I need and which sort of clothes do you advise me to take? I look forward to your answer and to the camp, naturally. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you very much for your last letter. As you asked me in your letter, I will try to explain my wonderful experience at this pop concert. First of all you have to know that it wasn't a common pop concert, but a real open air festival. It isn't the first year that I work there. However this year wasn't like last year. My job was as simple as selling ice-creams. You might say that it is quite boring, but it was so funny. Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream. It was  amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland. I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best. Love from ",31
917," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan Yesterday, I received your letter. It made me happy and I would like to than you for the opportunity you offer me First of all I would like to travel in July. I think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to California. This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. About the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen is swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough t this sector. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm intrested in this sport even if I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action. As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the cloths I must take with . Please drop me a line Yours sincierly  [SEP]  Dear Kim Yesterday I received your letter and it made me happy that you and your family are healthy. As you asked me I will write  you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough. Before the concert I helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert. It was really a very beautiful experience. It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too. In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and have a lot of autogrammes by them. I will never forget these days and for sure I will take part in activities like this in the future. Yours faithfully Alexander. ",32
244," Dear manager of the Circle Theatre, Last night, I cam to your musical show, ""Over the rainbow"" and I was very disappointed because it wasn't  what you writed in your advertisement. For example, your advertisement said that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not them! They were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This event was not the only one because another problem was the respect of the time. Your advertisement said that the show will start at 19:30 PM, but it has started at 20:15 PM. I don't like to have such big change in time. The third problem was that it was writting that the discounts were available, but when I get there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation. After that, I can tell you that I spend the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied about ""You will have a perfect evening!"" After all these explanations, I am sure that you will understand that I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night. So I wish to hear soon about you. Yours sincerly Leia Beroni  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology, such as computer, car and other else, changed my life in many different ways like communication, traveling and working. For example, a car, which is used from everyone everyday, changed my daily life in the sens that I don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology, but because I can show that I am responsable. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries that Switzerland. Another  technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it like homeworks, works, photos, but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web. This  a big walk in the technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. At last  technology that I would like to bring out is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or  else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one  here  are the most important in the change of my daily life .

621," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for granting me the first prize - Camping in California. I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A. before. I would like to have my two weeks with you in July, as it will be during my summer holiday in addition  that it is said to be the best season there. I will join in  the swimming group and the photography group. Both of them are my hobbies, I have won some prizes in my school competition of them. Therefore, I am quite confident about them. I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all  holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before. I would like to try it this time. As all the travel expenses are paid already, I would appreciate it if you could tell  what kind of clothing  also how much pocket money I need. I look forward to hearing from you in due course. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, The concert I helped  last week was the greatest experience I've ever had. I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage. You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the hi-fi system on the left side (it should be on the other side). Before  opening, the pop star found the mistake, otherwise it would be a disaster. The performer, Paul, is a big music name at the present. But I'd never met him before. This time, I saw him in person. I told him I loved his songs, he was very happy. Then, we stroke a lovely conversation. Afterwards, he gave  his pen for my enthusiasm. Anyway, how are you? Write soon, tell me how you're getting on in your new job. Best wishes, ",33
1064," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing in behalf of my class- maid about the programme you had organised for us. We all want to thank you for having choose such good places in London. We are especially excited about the river trip to greenwich which will be in the first day. I would particularly like to talk about the second day. We really liked the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for  London fashion and leisure show that will happen on tuesday and we are very interested in go. As you know our class are composed by girls and it would be very exciting for us if we can have a look on the latest fashions, make up and so on. Although we would like to visit the science museum, we can leave it to the next opportunity, what we suggested to do is intead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure show and keep the afternoon programme the same. We hope you accept this change for good. We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Last summer I went to  amazon on an expedition with other 10 people, such as a guide, a doctor, a scientist & all the rest  as me were just curious. We walked all day and took rest in the evenings. We were not allowed to leave out tents during the night or until the day start, because of the dangerous animals which leave there. But for me it was the most exciting moment. One can be really amazed by the view. One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without  seen and started walking towards the river, because I want take some photographs of the sun rise. The view took my breath of when suddenly something took my breath . It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as  she was very hungry. I knew I could not do any moviment for my safety but I did and for my surprise It run away. ",31
154," Dear Sir/Madam I am writting  you for complaining about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre. I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before . Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late. We would not have had  discounts on  price and any worker wanted to give us an explanation for that. After the show, we decided to go to the restaurant to dinner, but it was closed for work. Everything was completely different from what you had announced on the advertisement I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction, I mean, refunding me exactly what I had paid for this terrible evening. I look forward to hearing from you very soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent  . A simple example, we can at the same time wash our clothes with a washing machine, record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world. All this in one morning, and the day just begins, what  doing next? Technology allows  to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to . We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention, time is not a really problem. We will see people differently, with more calm, because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more comprehensible with others. It is the first step for a true fraternity. Of course, everything can not be completely perfect. All this modern technology increase the level of polluted products that can not be easily destructed. Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to product more food, but more food means chemical agents on  earth, the circle never stops. In conclusion, modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like, although I know, all this has a price. ",26
60," Dear Jane C I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival recently and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it. When I knew it was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small  that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all  events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money. Although that Festival was not well-organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls. I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It is really nice to hearing from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other. Personally, I can not imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others. As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important  concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority . As a consequence, most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them. At home it is the other way about. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting friends , watching TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate with  house-keeping and meal. That is all! Hope you enjoy my experiences Best wishes ",31
16," Dear Jane Clark Hello, I spent two days at your annual international arts festival. I was very impressed and I wish you could make the festival better next year. I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other country's art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many country's people. You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small  that the people can't even dance in classical concerts. This years' 'plays and films' was too short. I was very disappointed about this, but the other shows were great. I felt very good about all these shows. In my opinion, the tickets for all events is a wonderful idea, because everybody has a chance to see everything and the people would think this is a great festival. What do you think about picking five people and give them tickets for 'Art Travel'? I think this is a good idea. Generally it was very good and I wish more people would come next year. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back  soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same. First, In school, we are not allowed to run. This is very important, because many accidents happen because of running. When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best  what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other student's study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday. I think the main rule is when you can play computer games, because they love computer games. Tell me about English rules. I'm curious about it. Your best wishes from   ",27
218," Dear Sir/Madam, Further to the umpleasent fact that took place last week I am in my right of complaining about the musical show I saw when I was in London. First of all, when we arrived we went to pay and we gave  a discount ticket. It was not available but the worst thing was that nobody explained us the reason. The show had to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15, then I felt dissappointed because the main actor had been changed. It  had not been such a terrible thing if the new actor would have acted as well as the other one. If it does not seem enough, after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday. After explaining you my complains I hope you to send me some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was our last school year, so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate  we had finally finished it. We knew that our parents wouldn't let us to travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid they could realize what happened. Kim, Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so, did I. We were excited and we started to organized everything. We booked some rooms in a hotel, next to the beach and we bought all the useful things we were going to need. It seemed  the perfect holiday but it wasn't. Pat was in love with my eldest brother whose name is Jon (I have never got on well with him). Pat told him our idea. Pour Pat, she didn't know my brother, she didn't know how he was. Jon told my parents what we wanted to do. We lost our holidays. ",24
665," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing  you to give you the information you need, but first of all I would say that I am really delighted and I would  thank you. If it would be possible I wish I travel in July because I have planned my holidays this month at work and I would not be able to remove them for accommodation, I would choice the log cabin, I am not very fond of ""adventure"", that is why tents are not for me. I expect that these two weeks will be as a big rest. Third, you need to know which sport I want to to practise. I would choice photography and tennis. In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera... (I guess that you shouldn't borrow some! About tennis, I play for eight years and I am used to sit for competition. To finish, I wonder if I need to bring some money or if all has been already payed  and what kind of clothes should I bring? Yours sincerely Joachim Delerm  [SEP]  Our engineer school is specealized in mecanics and thermodynamics. Needless to said that we must faces our attention to these fields. First, we could film  fluid mecanics lessons and  general mecanics lessons. I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories, in which we could show  student making experimentations. In order to strike people who will watch the film, we could record  student drawing on the big drawing tables. I would do the same for thermodynamics. Nevertheless, we should not forget the extra-life school. We have to show sports at school and all  activities that we are offered. There are not only the brain which should be trained. Futur students could appreciate to come if they could still practise their sport. Another point to record woubl be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time, it will show a part of the way of life in the school. If you want further information or if you disagree, tell me  it. ",24
1154," Dear Maria Smith, First of all, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people. It has a swimming-pool and a nice bar. The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference  and there will be a bus available to go directly over there. At the end of the conference, there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes; jean's is not allowed. Next to the restaurant, there is a disco for people who like dancing. We can do a lot of things in my area. We have the possibility to visit the old town, it's very nice and there is a lot of shops. We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too.  [SEP]  I find television the most important invention. I think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore. In one hand it's because they have not enough money to pay  it and in the other hand it's because they can't move very well for example if they are disabled. With television, old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore. Television is a good way to be informed with the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers, it's more relaxing. I think television is a good invention for children  when they have free time and while they are watching television, we don't have to look after them if we have something important to do. ",26
805," Dear Sirs! First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation. I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer  tents. For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature. I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California. I've chosen singing and swimming. Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well. I'm also used to sing in front of a large number of people 'couse I did it several times. I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional. There are two further questions which I have to ask you. First How much money do I have to take with me? and what clothes should I choose? I'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer this questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered a competition. I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it.  But it was true. My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life. Hope you answer this letter as soon as possible. Lots of hugs and kisses ",36
1010," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to thank you for the good programme, especially on Wednesday, because the other student and I like Art Galleries. But, the last Friday, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show. Now, we want to know if it is possible to go to watch this Show. It is on Tuesday 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall between 10.00 and 19.00. We think that it is a great opportunity because it is just one time per year and it is free for stundents. We suggest you to change the programme. We think that Monday and Wednesday are good, but we ask you to change the programme on Tuesday. If it is possible, we want to go to the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and don't go shopping. We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Last July, I went to spend two weeks with my best  in a beautiful village in the south of France, near Saint-Tropez. We lived in my aunt's house who was in the center of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there is a house with  swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was the famous French singer's house. One night, I heard a strange sound. I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine. They went into the house through a window. I though it was some rubbers. I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone to the police. I went near the house and waited to look what it would happen. After ten minutes, one man came out with a big bag and went into his car. When the other man came out, I caught him and fighted him. The first man went away, because a police car arrived. The policeman came to take the bugglar and thanked me  to catch him. ",26
1051," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to tell you that my class is interested in going to the show which takes place in  central exhibition Hall in London in 14th March. We have seen it in the advertisment and I would like to go to the show. I would also like to tell you that it is  very interesting programme because it includes all the latest fashion about leisure and sports wear  make up as well as hairstyles. It is  great opportunity for us because the fashion is fashinating and free. I should be more grateful if you could change the programme so as  to go to the show. For example we shall be able to putoff our visit at the science museums in Thusday morning for Wednesday afternoon. The fashion show starts at 10 oclock and finishes at 19 o'clock. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  All the people have the right to have a private life without others people to disturb them  following  all the time. The journalists follow the famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take fotos and  other information about them. After that  journalist sell their information in the newspaper and magazines in order to earn money. I thin that it is very dangerous because the famous peple cannot have you private life and on the other hand they may suffer from deppresion and sadness which may be lead them to suicide. I think that the goverment have to protect them and their private life from the journalist,  punishing them. I think that the government I responsible for the private life of the people. All the people have the right to live free without to be disturbed by other . ",23
153," Dear Sir, or Madam, Your advertisement for the musical show, Over the rainbow, said it was London's newest and best musical show, I agree with that because it is a wonderfull show but, it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it. I was really excited, but it turned out to be a different actor and I thought that was quite disappointing. The show started at 20:15 when it actually should have started at 19:30. While I was waiting I thought I should inform myself about the discounts available, the shocking thing was there weren't any! On the advertisment it also said, you could visit our restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason. What I'm trying to say is that this wasn't my perfect evening out and that I should get at least some money back! Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As we know, Carla and Pat were good friends so Carlotta would tell Pat anything. This time she told Pat that she thought her dog, Churls, was going to die. Pat couldn't resist herself and told her brother Jacob, he was quite shocked about the news because, he missunderstood. He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it.' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles's house. There, Jacob aproaches to him slowly and tells him. ""Charles, you can't be with Carlotta anymore, she's evil."" Jacob whispers ""What, you're crazy."" Charles responds. ""She said she was going to kill you!"" Jacob shouts. ""I'll talk to her."" Charles exclaims. When Charles told Carlotta what he knew, Carlotta started crying. It was all a missunderstanding. They managed to sort everything out and Carlotta never had anymore secrets. ",32
246," June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show 'Over the Rainbow' permormed on the Circle theatre last week. To begin with, there were no discounts available, and nobody seemed to be able to explain the reason . Second, the musical started forty-five minutes later! and, to make matters worse, the actor was not Danny Brook as the advertisement said. The new actor was not as good as Danny Brook, and he did not perform  the show as he should have done. Finally, I found that the theatre restaurant was closed because there had been problems with one of the ovens. What was suppoused to be a perfect evening out turned  to be  disappointing one instead. I am afraid something should be done about this, and I urge you to refund my ticket. I am looking forward to receiving your response. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is often said that technology has changed our lives in many ways, and that we live better now. However, technology has also brought many problems to Society. Technology brings  me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier. If I want to know how a friend is, I just have to phone him; I can see how the world is going on only by switching on the television, and I can cook in  some minutes using the Microvelle oven. However, there are a lot of negative aspects in the way that technology affects my life. As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job. In conclussion, I think that technology has two faces which affects my life as well as everybody else's life. I believe that we should try to change this bad aspects, or learn to live with them.

39," 16th, Dec. 2000 Dear Mr. Clark, I'm writing this letter to complain and to suggest something about your ""International Arts Festival"". I visited the festival for 2 days. I also read an advertisement in ""The Times"". I thought it would be interesting and exciting. When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good. I was impressed of the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culture and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days  the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for  student too. However, you said ""Stars and artists from around the world"" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except  these two things, it was quite good. I'd like to suggest this - concerned with plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival. I'm looking forward to hearing your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I'd like to tell you about my experiences. Before that you have to think  why you need to earn money and how you do that. It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose. Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old. Secondly, I made  brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was  part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works. I could earn money,  also I got a career. Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult, but I think that was  easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So  lose was bigger than  profit. In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose  proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too. If you haven't  purpose, you would waste money easily and quickly. ",27
35," Jane Clark, The organiser, I am writting to you to give your my opinion about your festival. It was great, but I think it could be even better next year. First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries were here. So, if you can have more than six countries, it could be great. This idea is in relation with the number of plays and films. If there are more stars and artists from around the world, there are more plays and films and it is better. My second complain is about some   concert halls which are too small. It would be better if you have some  large halls, like your ""Arena"" hall. To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one reasonally price, because for someone who do not like especially art, it was very attractive. A least suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some ""salsa"" band, It would be great to listen and dance in the same time  ""salsa"" music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jimmie, I was very happy to receive a letter from you. I am writting to you to answer at your question about school rules and what I am (and I am not) allowed to do at home. Firstly in the school it is not permitted to smoking in the no smoking area or in the classroom. But, I think it is the same in England. Secondly, when you want to ask a question to the teatcher, you must to put your hand up, and speak when the teacher ask you. In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly. For example, put the music  too hight when my syster is working. But there are also some life's rules, like do not put  legs on the table when we are eating or  eat with my fingers. There are not really anything that I could like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries. It is just polite's rules. I hope I answered to your question. Big kisses, ",26
960," Dear MRS HELEN RYAN. I am very pleased with the prize that I won and I would like to give you more information about it, because I would really really like to go to California, I have always wanted to go to California. First of all, I'm very ill at the moment and I need about a week to get better and I would like to travel within the next few weeks if  is possible (July 2000). In accodance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents, because I think their unusual and  is not something that you do everyday. You have also asked me to give you two activities (sports) which I would like to do while I am at the camp. The kind of activities that I like from the list that you gave me are Basketball and Swimming. I would also like to ask you about the weather to see what kind of clothes shall I take with me. On the other hand I don't know how much money I should take. Is the food paid for? What about all the other expenses like gas, electricity, water and all the others. May I ask you to bring me some more information about the question that I have asked you ? Thank you very much about your letter Yours SINCERELY  [SEP]  Dear Mrs Andersen I would like to give you, and the others in the class my opinion (for the video that you are going to do) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why. Well, in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but  in real life are useful, are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we must all know WHERE we live, what are the problems that we have in this world, what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for  it and  the gold as well, there are loads of thinks about geography that we MUST KNOW. In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video film. You can put  a few activities (sports) like basketball, football,  tennis, but only those because their are very popular and people will have interest on them. My advise for you is: ""Do not put  to much subjects, just put  a few subject and make them look interesting"" Yours SINCERELY ",24
273," Dear manager, My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am writting to make you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical show of the London theatre. I decided to see the 19:30 show so I arrived on time at 19:00 o'clock. I went to buy the ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near of the stage I bought a £20 tiket but when I asked for the discount they told me ""I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement, It will be impossible to make you a discount"". This was my first problem. At 19:15 I was very impatient waiting for the show begins and a man anounced that the show will start at 20:15. I had to wait more that an hour outside the theatre because to make matters worse I couldn't spend the time in the theatre restaurant. The reason they gave me  it was closed because it was being repaired. Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor. Now what I hope is you refound me my money, it was a horrible evening out Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I would be the best party of the year. Last month was my grandmother birthday and I organised a party for her. My grandmother loves the parties and when she was young she used to organise big parties for all the family and friends. Now she is 85 years old so she can't do that but, I can. I organised everything like: the place, the food, the decoration, I sent letters by post to everybody she knows. It seems  to be the bigger party of her life. I thought she could have a show in this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend,  if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programes. She loved the idea and said she had differents shows so  to decide which could be the most suitable. I told her to make me a phone cold. Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought  but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended. But after all the party was great.

7," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you to give  some opinions of mine abut The International Arts Festival. It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing, plus of getting some important knowledge from it. On the other hand there were some disadvantages: 1. Stars and artists wee only from six countries 2. Some concert halls were too small. So it was impossible to get tickets there. 3. I think that there were not enough plays and films. To sum up I want to tell you bout my suggestions for next year's festival. It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with  signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that  dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g.  national dancing of all the countries) to impress  audience and not to bore with the similar scenes. I hope this letter will help you in organying  Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello Philip, I have just got your letter. It is a pleasure for me to communicate with such a friend as you are. Thank you very much. In our school we have the following rules: 1. Every puple has to sit alone (I mean that one desk is given for one man) 2. One should have such marks as ,,3"", ,,4"", ,,5"" not ,,2"" which is eaqual to fail. 3. Another strict rule is not to be late for your lessons. Otherwise you are not allowed to come in. These rules are strict and certainly we have  endless number of just-so-called rules. I don't think you will be interested in them. Truely speaking I am not sure about home rules. I think that in our family everything is based on mutual understanding. We don't have old-traditioned rules or something alike . I'm afraid I must be going now because I want to send you this letter today. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",22
1042," Dear Mr Robertson: Firstly, I'm very glad to hear from you. Thank you for being organised the programme for our class, I think you may think about a long time that how shall we study during  three days. We have seen your programme, and like all of those , especially the Science Museum, it will  good for us to increase our knowledge, and so on. Secondly, I wonder if you know it will have ""London fashion and Leisure "" be showed on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will introduce, is most interested in us, I mean it's conflict with your plan, what a pity! All of us want to go to the show, the generation who are the same ago with us all like make up, become beautiful, and it's important that it will  free for students and just be showed  one day. So, we don't want lose this chance. Finally, we would like to get your permition to go, maybe if it is possible that you  change your programme, we may be going to your college any time after Tuesday. We're sorry to give you trouble. We look forward to hearing from you again as soon as possible. Best Wishes  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. This story happed two years ago. That was a very hot summer, every people in our city like to swim in the river, perhaps they didn't think it was interesting if they swimed in the pool. Personally, I'd like to say I was good at swimming. Not only I was a member of  swimming team in our school, but also I was tought by my father since I was five years old, So I would understood some skills and  how to protect yourself from my Dad, if you had a accident. One day, I passed by a river in accident, I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river. Suddenly, I heard  of ""help, help"" in my distance. In a while, lots of passed-by crowed to the river-side. To my surprise, nobody want  to save that boy who was shouting,  just stood there, like lots of ""champ"". I started think about it, after all, either had I neve done this task before, or trained. I  just 15 years old. Finally, I jumped into the river, I really knew that was dangerous, but I haven't think about anything except ""justify"" this word. I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time. Thank goodness, I succeed,  save that struggled child. When I went the river-side bank, I saw some red-faced. ",22
105," Sir, Madame I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. But I was not very satisfied after my ""perfect evening"" out. The advertisement for the Musical Show was very good, but the information was not correct. You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing. In the advertisement  was written that the show will start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later, at 20.15! Because of the advertisement I thought that I can   discount  the tickets available but I couldn't. After the show I need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved, but it was closed. And there was no reason why . So you can see that it was not a so perfect  evening for me then I thought. Now I hope that you can understand my question for some money back because of the trouble I had.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secretes. This was the only reason why that she had not  a lot of friends. When Pat  came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few time the others have seen that Pat can't keep secrets. So they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important. Sometimes it finished like this that the others only said: ""Hello, how are you?"" and then went away without listening  the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams were coming. She dreamed about good friends,  time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets. Then one day she met this person. It was Katha, a girl who had the same problems like Pat. So they found both the person they dreamed from. ",25
593," DEAR MS. RYAN, I'M WRITING THIS LETTER TO EXPRESS THAT THE RESULTS CATCH ME ABSOLUTELY BY SURPRISE! I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY MOST TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAD TO PASS MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE  AND I'M TAKING IT IN JUNE. ANSWERIN TO ANOTHER OF YOUR QUESTIONS, I' PREFER TO HAVE ACCOMODATION ON LOG CABINS, BECAUSE OF MY COLUMN PROBLEM WHICH DON'T LET ME SLEEP ON THE GROUND (OR ON A SLEEPING BAG). DURING MY STAY AT THE CAMP I'M REALLY FOND OF KEEPING  MY TENNIS AND SWIMMING ROUTINES. I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MANTEIN A COLUMN TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAVE RECOMMENDED ME TO DO. ALSO, IF I HAVE ANY LEISURE TIME BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PIANO LESSONS, I PRACTISE TENNIS. SO, AND IF IT POSSIBLE, I WAS INTERESTED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF COVER MY ROUTIN THERE. LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAD TO CARRY SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS FOR PREPAIRING MY LUGGAGE PUTTING ONLY THE APROPPIATES CLOTHES. LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU YOURS SINCERELY,  [SEP]  'THIS IS SUCH A MARVELLOUS BOOK YOU WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN'. ARE YOU A SCIENCE FICTION HISTORIES LOVER? ARE YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF KNOW HOW A MARTIAN IS? IF YOU REALLY FIND READING THIS KIND OF BOOK INTERESTING, YOU WON'T MISS THIS BOOK. DURING, THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN READING ""A WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE"" AN OXFORD BOOKMARKS COLLECTION BOOK. THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY WELL KNOWNS WRITTERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY. BUT THE MAIN PURPOUSE OF THE BOOK IS ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND HAVE A LOOKING OF HOW A LIFE  GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE, WHEN, PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE COMMANDED BY MACHINES. I THINK THAT THIS IS A MARVELLOUS BOOK TO READ, BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT YOUR MIND UP AGAINST THEMES LIKE ""HUMAN RACE EXTINTION"" AND ALSO OBTAIN A COMPARISON BETWEEN  HUMAN-MIND AND COMPUTERS. SO, IF YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH A ""REALLY SPLENDID SCIENT FICTION BOOK"" I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ ""A WINDOW..""

914," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thank you for first prize. I was glad to win your competition. I look forward to coming soon. I would like to travel in July. Because it is the only free time I will have. I was very happy to hear that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. And I would prefer  tent to  log cabin. Because I have had experiance  to leve in  tent and I like it very much. Thank you for  chance to do two activities. I would like to choose Tennis and Photography. I play tennis since I was ten years of age. In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed. Another activity what I have chosen is photography. I have just finished  profesional photographer course and I would like to continiew my education in this activity. I would like to ask some questions. First of all what kind of clothes  I have to take with me? Also, how much money  I have to take? Look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I was glad to hear from you. Like I said, I'd helped at a pop concert. I liked it very much. It was very interesting and enjoing. A pop concert had ten pop bands. Each of them must sang two songs. After all they chose  three best bands. While this concert I saw a lot of popular singers. For example: Maraya Kary, Tom Jone; Madonna. I saw the ""Boys on"". I knew you love them and I took two autographs for you and of course for myself. Afterwards ""Boys on"" won the first prize.

921," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Your letter which says I won first prize in your competition has just been arrived. I love to come  the camp  California. Thank you very much for making my dreams real. I always want to go and se  USA! I would like to answer your questions about this trip. Before everything, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English in a college. Such being the case, I need to wait until my college's lessons finishes. If it's possible for you I would prefer to come in July. Before this time, I usually stay in log cabins, But I never had  chance for staying in a tent. According to me, to say in the tents is mor exciting than to stay in the log cabins. That's why, I would love to choose tents for living for 2 weeks! On the other hand, I've just learnt from your letter that I can have some sport activities during the camp. I'm very happy about this. Because, I spent most of my scholl life  for sports, specially for basketball. But, after staring to work, I hadn't any chance for playing basketball. Now, you gave  a opportunity. As a my second activities, I would like to choose photography, because my education was including photography, I love to take some photographs about nature. Meanwhile, I'd like to ask some questions to you. When I'm coming, what king of clothes could  be able to wear in there? And also, what do you think how much money, I'll need to spend for two weeks. I'm looking forward for your answers. Thank you very much. Your sincerely. Elif  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! I hope you're fine. Because, in these days I'm very happy.

Lots of people came  this area, and I also learnt how to arrange something. Then I was very tired but I enjoyed with the music very much.

1022,"  Dear Mr Robertson, First of all I would like to thank you  the chance to do such a gorgeous trip. We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the Museum and  Gallery. However, there is one point that we would like to change in the programme. We are interested in visiting ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" during our travel. The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make up, and also  leisure and sports wear. Furthermore  is totally free for students. All this exhibiots are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence in our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it. We think that we could go there   next 14th of March, in the eveninng, instead of going shopping. This one could be translate to  15th  evening. It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we are totally agree that we don't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum. We truly believe you will consider our change. Please contact us if you have any question. Yours faithfully  [SEP]   Almost everyone relation famous people with photographers, articles, money, fans, ... Normally, one people's dream is to be famous and rich but without that stuff of being without privacy Nowadays, there is a lot of people that life only with the money they get in advertisments, reports about their last romance, ... but not everyone does the same . On the one hand you find the ones that are well-known and never talk about their privacy. They use the publicity exclusive for their work. On the other hand,  are the ones that are also respectabled but, appart from their relation with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly seek by photographers. I mean, they enjoin being the point of view or the center of everyone, even though it means to see their lifes. Communications move the world and famous people use them to improve their work, politicians for their campain and film stars to make famous their last movie. Nevertheless, sometimes communications disturb their lifes in a wrong way. ",29
286," Dear Sir, I'm writting to you to make a complaint about your musical show: "" Over the Rainbow""... Last week, I, my husband and our two children went to your theatre spend a good time, but we were so disappointed. First of all, I think it's not professional to change the principal actor in the last minute, the play should be with Danny Brook, but it wasn't. In addition to this, the show started at 20:15 instead  19:30, more  45 minutes in late... Moreover, there weren't  discounts available like writting in your advertisement. There was well a restaurant, even though, it was closed for reparations, also 2 hours 30 without drinking or eating something, was quite difficult for the children. It should be a perfect evening out, but it was the opposite. It's why, it would be grateful, if you could give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Nowadays, I think it could be impossible for us to live like our grand-parents or great grand-parents lived... we are too lazy, but it's not our mistake, this revolution is called ""progress""! Every day, like everybody, I watch the TV, see the International news, hear the radio, play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house. It seem be incredible, but it's commun habits for us.. we don't think that there is less of a hundred years , nothing of that existed. I will always said thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines wich make the washing and the washing-up, before this, the women spent a long time had done this tasks. In addition to this, thinking also, to the medicine, science or astronomy progress... And it's not ending, I hope that for my thirties I'll go to Mars on holidays... The scientists are again ten years to find the solution... ",29
78," Dear Ms Jane Clark. I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently. The festival was excenent in many ways, and especially it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with  proper price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic. However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars   participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year. I hope that next year's festival will be much more successful that this year's one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'. Above all, realistic stories teach me something of the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up  taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways. In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read  other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives. We all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality. That's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones. ",34
653," I feel very happy to be the winner of your competition. I would like to travel in July only because they will need me at work in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I have never done it and I think it is an experience not to be missed, a very original adventure! I would like to do singing and swimming. For the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very few experience in it. Concerning swimming, I practise this sport once a week on myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer! Otherwise, I would like to ask you which clothes I will have to take in my luggage. What is the weather like in July? Is it worth to take a raincoat? Should I take trainers? Finally, how much money must I bring with me? Is it necessary to ask for Travellers' Cheques? Or is it better to take only an international credit card?  [SEP]  Going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what  to do but it has also many disavantages. First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are on week-end. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want. Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had to find a  cloth for a precise day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it. However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what  to do. You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant to try  many  clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny! Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible. For instance, if you try  a cloth which fits you well, it can contribute to make you feel better.

Due to my business, I am very busy and that it is the best moment for my business so, I can't manage my time to go on holiday but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go on swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning swimming for the last eight months and I really enjoyed it. Another sport I experience is Basketball which I used to play for a school's team when I studied at secondary school. I have not been practising it at all recently but only wish I had. This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again. I wonder if you could answer me some questions? Have you had any recommendations  what type of cloths should I take with me? Do you suggest me to take cash or can I used my credit card? Will there be any tour-guide during the trip? I thank you again for your assistance and am looking forwards to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely, Prasert Charoenkul  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It has been quite a long time since I last written to you. I hope you are well. I have something really exciting to share with you. There was a concert of Michael Jackson in my city last month. It was a charity concert which was organised by a university  I am studying. My classmates and I, we were asked to do decorating the stage,  cleaning the concert's area. But guess Kim, what was the most exciting  for us was, we were asked to be the singer's interviewer. It wasn't a spokeperson Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage. I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say. If you imagined yourself talking to the most famous pop singer such as him how would you feel? But what I really enjoyed on that evening was when we took a photographs with him after his concert and he signed it for us on the back side of each picture. We had a wonderful evening. His concert was absolutely brilliant. Everyone was screaming, shouting and dancing while he was singing. I wish you were here with us. Are there anything wondering happen over there? Please write  me when you have time. I am looking forwards to hearing from you. Love, Prasert Charoenkul ",31
432," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because I have recently been at your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening. I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available. I asked for it but the answer I received was that there wasn't any kind of discount. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at the moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant  to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed! I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to reply but there had been only problems. I'd like not only to reply but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't ""perfect"" as you advertised but it was a big disaster. I am looking forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Every aspect of our daily life is influenced by technology. I'll give you some examples describing how technology affects my life every day. The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare  fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer. During all the day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail. Sometime I stay alone all the day but I have contacts with many people. When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to control my bank account  use  Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office. When I finish to work I come back home. If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven. If I'm too tired to go out with my friends I finish my day looking a programme on television. I know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world. To conclude, I think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life. But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to make a step without it. ",33
458," Dear Sir, I've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical, starting from the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets. There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30. And I am asking you: Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience? I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back, please I hope you will reply to my letter. Regards XX  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life. We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages. The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature. And  not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone. In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology  is a benefit for you. If you don't  is going to destroy you. ",33
416," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre. First of all, there was written in the advertisement for the show, that there would be Danny Brook as main actor, but a different actor played in the show. The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me. Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there was not  discounts for ticket, while you wrote the contrary. Moreover, I could not go to the theatre restaurant because, by the time the show had finished, it had already closed. Definetely, it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit. This was her only fault. She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her. That was why she decide to change her behaviour. She was given a chance: if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would have started trusting her. The secret was about a surprise-party for her bestfriend's birthday. As soon as the arrangement for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend. But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more. The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret. All her friends were amazed at  her change and started trusting her at once. ",31
362," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  wich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show. The first problem concerned the main actor of the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him. The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the public, including me, was forced to wait for fourty five minutes. It was also written in the show's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets. However, there was not any. The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given. In conclusion, the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back. I would like to hear from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything. One day, I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly. I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart. Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love. The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmous saddness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately brake up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore. Now, unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend or a best friend, all because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",39
367," Dear sir or madam, I have recently been on a holiday in London. During my stay I went to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed. First the advertisement said that there were discounts available but there were not. Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15. Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor . Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor. We saw the musical in sadness. Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner. To our surprise the restaurant was closed because  the lack of staff to keep it open. It was certainly not a perfect night out. I would be very pleased if I could have my money back. I hope to receive the payment as soon as possible. Yours faithfully FREDA SVENSSEN  [SEP]  Fashion of the future What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that. I gave it a thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind from plastic-fabrics. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes. I mean when the earth's getting warmer and warmer because of an pollution that we people cause  the world. Maybe in the future they'll find out a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine. Maybe everybody will end up wearing shorts and skirts. Strict suits will be transformed into a school-uniform-like shirt and knee-lengthed shorts. Anyway we defenately now that they're going to change. If we live long enough we'll be able to find out , so keep living! ",35
865," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply for your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer season, and it is nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer my accomodation to be in  log cabins, because I am alergic to some insects that might go in the tent. In regard to the activities, I would like tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have  some techniques, that I would like to put on practise. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where can I change my money to American dollars cheaper. I would  ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are doing fine, I am writing this letter, to tell you about my experience of helping  a pop concert. Firstly, you need to know, and be counscious of what you are doing. I spend two weeks preparing all the stage, speakers, background, michrophones, everything with all the staff, and every night, the artists came to rehearsal their show, I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff. The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired, however, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts were worthy, the crow and artists thanked the staff. What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all like a big team, working together. That was what made it mostly special. Try it, I recommend it. Write back soon, Love, Carmen Dolores Rossell. ",36
934," 13.06.00 Dear Mrs Ryan,  I would like to thank you for  first prize. I am really surprised that I have won. I have not expect it. I would like to send you some futher information which you need. I can only come in July because I am working in the office and I cannot take two weeks off in  other month. I am greatful that I have the chance to choose an accomodation. I would rather stay in a tent if its not  problem for you. I would like to experience a reall camp again. I used to be a scout. I need relax after  year in the office thats why I choose photography and painting which are not very active. I am  very shy person and I would prefer to stay in a small group of people, if its possible. I have to questions. I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I should take and I would like to know your opinion  how much money I should take. I would like to thank you onc again for this great opportiunity. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Apolonia Gorski  [SEP]  We would like to belive that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life. After working all week, finally on Saturday we can do shopping. We love spending money, but spending money is not always enjoyable. Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go confortable because of  crowd. Why its always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundrets other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods. ",29
754," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you  the further informations you asked for: I only have two months of vacation that are July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July. I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you: Do I need to bring  particular clothing like a surfing suit, for instance? Is any ""pocket money"" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards? Best Regards Chi Chen  [SEP]  Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare. You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier. Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into more frustration and tiredness. So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.

155," Dear Manager, Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"" and I was really disillusioned. In the advertisement, it was told that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing. I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance at him. Also, in the schedule, the time of the show was written as 19:30, but it started at 20;15 and, I missed the dinner I was going to have with my best friend in London. Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill gates, I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets; but I had to give the exact price of the ticket, which I consider  as a fault of your theatre. In addition to these, it was mentioned that your restaurant was open after the show, but it was not because there was no food to be served. As you can understand, it was a dreadful time and I went my money back as a solace for the dissapointment I had. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGY AND MY DAILY LIFE In my daily life, I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier to live. However, I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships. Until 1996, I used to go to school on foot or by public bus; but since 1996; I take the underground to go to school. It is much quicker, and I do not have to wake up very early in order not to be late. Also, I use my computer and  Internet very much in order to reach some information, do my projects and communicate with my friends. To talk to a friend from another city or country instantly online is really nice and exciting. I do not have to wait for a letter for days and I gain so much time again. on the other hand, because of dealing with computers so much, I can not see my family and friends very much, even when we are at the same medium. It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker. But despite this, I am very happy with the facilities of technology in my daily life. ",36
1108," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to express my pleasure about the successful programme that you have prepared for our school, especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery. In addition, I would like to inform you about an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which my classmates and I have seen. We are really interested in  latest fashions and new hairstyles, but also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and  especially girls enjoy seeing the different kinds of making up. Furthermore, we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money. This event takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday on  14th of March. I would be grateful if you would consider my suggestion. If you agree to  visit  this exhibition, we will spend our day there, thus we should cancel the shopping, but we will be able to purchase some presents  next day, as you have not organised a specific plan. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to hit a human being and unfortunately, although I respect every form of life humans, animals and plants, I managed to hit a burglar. Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt at hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed. While I was listening to my favourite cassette, I heard a strange noise. Immediately I opened my door and... I could not believe my eyes! A short man stood in front of me! Without any warning he pushed my arms. I shouted as I pained. I realised that he was very strong. But I was faster and more intelligent than him. I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found one hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him. To my relief I managed to survive! ",34
101," Dear Manager of The Circle Theatre. I'M WRITING TO YOU TO EXPLAIN MY DESAGREABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE THE LAST SATURDAY, IN YOUR SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY DURING ONE MONTH. MY INTENTION WAS TO SPEND AN SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL!!! YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY. BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES  TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE. BUT WHAT CANNOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED. IT ISN'T ALL. WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER, AS YOU PUBLISHED ON THE PROGRAMM, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS!!! YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER. NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES, AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY . I FEEL YOU LIE  ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS. I WAIT  YOUR ANSWER, AND  OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Your's faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat wasn't the most popular boy in the school. He was shy, reserved and a very closed person. He enjoyed himself reading,  playing piano at home. Despite his way of live, his best friend was Anna, the most popular girl in the school. She explained everything what happened in her live to Pat. When Pat was 16, he decided to change his way of live, spending more time with friends, but what he could do to have some friends? Definately the worse. He started to ""sell"" the secrets of Anna to all the boys of the school who were interested in her. All the boys of the class went to Pat to know what Anna was doing in every moment, and Pat was becoming 'friend' of all the boys. He was very happy, because he felt that everybody loved him. Everyone, less Anna. She didn't tell him anything more, and Pat didn't have any secret to sell to his ""new friends"". At least, Pat didn't have any friend, because he didn't have anything to sell about Anna. Is it moral, to get some friends  destroying and hurting another people? I think NO! And you? ",25

But the students in our class have seen an adverstisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which'll take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show. It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions, make up,  hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends. There is one more advantage: it is free for students. So we would like to suggest you how the programme could be changed. First of all on Tuesday we all will go to the show and spend there all our day, but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have  free time we can go to the Science Museum if you don't mind, of course. Please let us know, as soon as you make your decission. With best wishes, your student.  [SEP]   Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Lucas!

I hope that it will be  good holiday for her, her family and friends. Now about your questions, it is very difficult for me to give any advice you about it, I don't know your cousin very well so I don't know what she prefers reading. But when I was fifteen my favourite book  "" Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". So I can recommended you to present  this book, because it is  very interesting, amuse, sometimes dramatic and mystery book. This book help us to impove our logic, mind,  memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, be more honest with other people and pay attention for the smallest details in our life because sometimes it can help us very very much. So I hope I could help you. Write  me as soon as you can. With best wishes, your ",28

The reasons I am really writing, However, is to give you some details of my trip to California. I'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it's the only month I can spend abroad this year. In the letter you said that  accommodation provided can be either  tents or  log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around . Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing (because I take part in a chorus at school) and photography. I'm really good  taking pictures, it's a way I have to express my feelings. I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring. Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp. I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is. thanking you in anticipation. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  What a surprise it was to get  letter from you after all this time. Sorry I haven't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job. This is just to let you know with whom I worked. In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city, the Coun Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band ""Five"" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also   the stages and  sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe  when he said: ""O.K. if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do."" My job was to leave some leaflets on shops, restaurants and  streets. Working with this band was an experience I will never forget. What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff. Although I was too nervious, I knew I could do the job well. I'd love to hear all your news, why don't you come and visit me? Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love from, ",36

It is increible!!, because I learnt some spanish words such us Hello, How are you? good bye?, What is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc, I am very happy that I promed to myself  learn spanish this sommar at the Huntingdon College. Also another interesting things was to know about their culture, because all of them come from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Uruguay. At the concert they were very susscceful because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic. I hope one day you and me can travel to South America because I would like to introduce you  my new friends. Now I have to end this letter, so please call me if you want to see me next week. Take care!! Love ",29
172," Dear Mr Jones, I'm writting this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle theatre. Firstly In the advertisement you said that the actor would be Danny Brook but there was a different actor in the show and I was really disappointed, because I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook which I personally admire. Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were being told but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed because of renovation. Finally there were no discounts available in the tickets. All the above made my night terribly disappointing and I must say that the advertisement is nothing but a business fraud, so I'm in the unpleasant position  to ask  my money back. I'm looking forward to your reply Yours sincerely Mrs Lemmings.  [SEP]  Technology is an essential part in people's life. It's something absoletuly necessary for every action people does It effects us both positive and negative. It's a part of our lifes. Firstly technology has created a bond between myself and my computer. I got used to spending 2-3 hours in front of the computer. My relationship with my family and friends doesn't even exist. I've end up being a T.V addict Also the need of doing simple things as a family is no longer the case. Why going to the countryside if you can sit there with a bowl of popcorns and watch T.V. Despite the negative effects, technology can effect with a positive way a person's life. Air conditions, watches, computers, and many other things have made my life easier. There's no need on going to the shops when I can order things by the computer. Air conditions also makes my life easier In addition technology has made my life easier but it's also an intrude in my life crating a distance between myself and my family. In my opinion technology is the least thing I could use in my life. ",30
405," Dear Sir of Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was presented by The Circle Theatre last week. I saw the performance and it was not like it was mentioned in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper. First of all, the main actor was not Dany Brook as it was expected so. That was very disappointing. Secondly it must have started at 14.30 and ended by 19.30. However, it started at 20.15. I had to wait almost an hour. Then, I was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true, so I just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show. Finally, I was thinking  to have dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees. What was suposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time. So I would be greatful if you payed for a full refund of the money I spent in the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Computers, radio, CD's, sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life. Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life, and it has some advantages as  some disadvantages. On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school. What I mean is that computers are very useful  to do my homework (like some monographies or researching). And I can't even think about how it would be  not having a computer. Another advatage is that, for example sattelite television, which is an example of modern technology, makes me be informed about what is happening on the whole world. On the other hand, I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult. The best example is the homework I have to do for school, I can't manage to do it when I don't have my computer to help. In addition to that, technology doesn't sometimes let me develop my imagination and creative skills. My mother says that I'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V. instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities. To sump up, I can't think about how my life would be  without technology. ",30
376," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you about an incident I had with the musical show which was presented by your theatre during my week's holiday in London. First of all, I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the starring was not Danny Brook as your company had published. Moreover, the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15. As the show finished later, we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but to our surprise, it was closed. As a result, we came back home in order to eat some fast food. An other thing is that there was  any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show. Before this week ends, I want your company to give me the money back. Otherwise, I will sue your company. I hope this kind of behaviour does not happen again. Your faithfully, Manuela T. Miracola  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day, while I was studying maths, one of my friends, called Pat, asked me to have a coffe with her. We went to a place called 'Deli' where we talked a lot about our school, the exams and, as we usually did, about our friends and boy friends. We asked each other a lot of questions but then we started talking about things that had never been talked about with anybody. Such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our life and that kind of secrets... The problem started when I confesed  her that I had fall in love with Larry, who was my cousin's boyfriend. In spite of the fact that I told her to keep it as a secret, she went to my cousin's house and made the retelling of what I had exactly told her.  As a result, my cousin went to my house in order to gave her a detailed description of it. As I solved the trouble with my cousin, I understood why my mother had told me that 'friends' sometimes weren't as you expected them to be. ",28
1071," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am representing an English class, which is going on a three-day London tour. We would like to thank you for organising our programme. We really appreciate your attention. The programme you suggest is versatile and full of interesting activities. We are eager to attend  National Art Gallery and Science Museum. But we would like to make our suggestion, if you don't mind. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would like to go to this exciting show. It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday on the 14th of March from 10 a.m. to 19 p.m. Our students will have a great opportunity of seeing the latest fashion, as this unique show is held only once a year. What's more, new hairstyles and leisure and sports wear are presented there. And apart from it, this activity is free of charge. We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon. We are thinking here particularly of the fact, that we can go to the show, instead of shopping. We sincerely hope that you will consider our suggestion. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebreties can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, what makes their life miserable. The first point I would like to make is that a private life of a celebrity is open to  public. I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely discussed in the mass-media. It is common knowledge, that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family. Another aspect is that  children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention. They can't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools. And last, but not least is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, show their real feelings to  public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering into their lives. I would like to sum up by saying that every person, either famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed. ",31
692," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because I receive your letter concerning the prize of two weeks in California that I have won. I would like to travel  the first two weeks of July because in June I will be working and at the end of July I am planing to go to Paris to attend a course of French. I would prefer to be accomodated in  tents because I love camping but I don't mind also the second possibility. In your letter you wrote that I will I the chance to do two activities; First of all I would like to play tennis because I have been plaing for seven years, secondly I would like to attend a course of surf but I have just some elementary knowledge. I would like also to have more information about the cost and which kind of clothes you suggest  to bring with me. I am looking forward  your reply Your faithfully  [SEP]  First of all I would like to say that I think it is important to concentrate this video in   few but interesting part of our daily life at school Interesting will be to show how the lessons are organize, saing that we are never doing just one activitie during the class. We should speak about our library that it is well furnished of several books, tape and video. After that we have to make sure that we explain how is it the relationship betwen teachers and students, showing the several time that we have been out together. In addition I think  should be reported in this video some personal opinion about the school  asking students and teachers. Finaly we should give some information also about our courses concerning tourism, buisness and computer. ",26
403," 16th November 2000 Dear Sir I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show. According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, the actors weren't those announced. Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove; we had mean actors. As for the times, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15. Likewise, there were no discounts avalaible. To end, in spite of being opened, the restaurant was closed for reparations. Because of all those inconvenients, I ask you  a total refund. I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company. You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important; because she trusted in him; immediatly he came to see one of his friend to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students of her class knew about what she had just said the day before to Pat. So immediatly she went towards Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up. Because of his behaviour, now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him. ",26
1017," Dear Mr Robertson, The reason of my letter, is that our class would like to suggest a few changes on our programme of London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme. First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to  Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon. Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion, the show would be fantastic, we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to make up. It's a great opportunity to know more about fashion. Please, let us go to the show, for students are  free. I Look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than it is now. In the future, our homes will have the most advanced technologies. Computer will take a important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in the computer we would buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer. We won't have the necessity of going out from home, because  computer will give us everything. Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love ..., that kind of things will never change. In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life will approve, and  computer will be very important for us, but is won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of a home = have, that will be the same as now.

512," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show. Over the Rainbow, which you advertised. I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June. However, I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement. First of all, I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play. He did not play in the evening. It made me sad. Secondly, the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15. We waited for ages because we had not been informed. In addition, although you advertised the discounts tickets  available, they do not sale them any more according to your staff. Finally, we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show. It was closed because of the staff trainning. I am sure you can understand my disappointment. I must insist that you refund the cost of the show. Unless I hear from you within ten days, I shall have to take legal advice on the matter. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is believed that our life style has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machine etc. Especially for families. I have found  very expensive to buy them but there are  number of advantages. First of all, dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children. It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working. Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them. He complained about  a lot. Secondly, computers are useful for us as well, because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information, for example  traveling. However my family's members do less communicate with each other than we used to, because my children are keen on playing computer games. In my opinion, the morden technology make our life style combinient. It is very good for us but I think we should think about more carefully when we buy something for our children. ",34
1105," Dear Mr Robertson, I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visiting London. I have read the programme and I find it very appealing, specially because of the River trip to Greenwich. However, I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I was wondering if we could visit it. The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall  the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. There will be shown the latest fashions, leisure and sportwear, some make up and also different hairstyles. The students are  free so we won't have to pay for the visit. We all think this is a great opportunity to learn more about London daily life and what people like to wear. I suggest visiting the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday morning and visit the Science Museum on Friday afternoon. We all hope you would consider our suggestion. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Almost everyone hates other people gossip in their private things. It's a natural reaccion to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping  and bothering your personal thoughts. So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or films stars don't deserve being followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time. I thing that  journalit's only aim is money, be cause they know that if they publish famous people's private life they would earn lot's of money selling the magazine or the newspaper. But they don't consider the problems the romours may bring to the famous family or couple. Sometimes the journalit's aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil the politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous. In conclusion, no matter which or what the journalit's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private life just as normal people have. ",26
312," The Circle Theatre 17th Jun 2000 Dear Sir and Madam I am writing this letter to want you to know that what I think about the musical show which you (The Circle Theatre) present. I bought  group ticket for the show. Because we were 7 people. I saw ""discount available"" in the advertisement. When I asked something about  ""discount"", your staf said that it is impossible. I ignored it. Becouse I wanted to see this show. Becouse my favorite actor plays in it. We went to the theatre bulding at 18:30. We waited to start the show  about one hour and fourty-five minutes. The show started late ( about 45 min.) We were bored and we wished that this is  last mistake During the show, we couldn't see Danny Brook who is my favorite actor. An other one played in the show. We were really angry. Becouse you said  lie to us. If Danny Brook does not play, you have to say something about this to  people who there are in the theater This is your unforgiven mistake. After the show, w were still angry, we wanted to eat something in your theater restaurant. When we came to the restaurant, we saw that it was close. I was sure that we can visit it after the show  is writing on the advertisement. We were hungry and angry in this time. This is  too bad evening for us. We were bored to waiting. We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show. We were hungry after the show. But we couldn't eat something and we couldn't use  discount. They are your mistakes. I hope that you can understand me and you will do something about  mistakes. When you do something, I went to see your new shows. But, now, I want to ask that you could pay my money back. Thanks for reading this letter Yours faithfull  [SEP]  CHANGING LIFE When I went to school, I wrote a letter to my friends. Becouse I hadn't got a mobile-phone. Now I have got a mobile-phone and I always use it. It's fast and easy. But sometimes I miss the letters. I miss to wait  the postman every morning. Before we had a computer, I played game with my friends in our garden or in their garden. We played a lot of games during  day. When we had a computer, I started to play computer games. I didn't want to play outside games with my friends. Becouse the computer was more interesting than my friends. I use  internet now. I don't buy  newspaper. Becouse I can read my newspaper in the internet. I can buy something from  internet. for example, I send a flower to my mum in mother's day by internet order. My daily life is changing. Everthing is easy now. I can send a mail to my friend who lives in Canada. I never forget important days. Becouse I have got a data-bank. When the important day is coming, it says to me. Life is really easy. You need to learn how you can use the technology. But, sometimes I miss  past days. I miss to play in the garden, post a mail to my friends,  forget the important day. Sometimes I want to go to somewhere without technology. ",21
424," Dear Sir or Madam. I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see ""Over the Rainbow"", the musical show that was played at this moment. First of all, the actors mentionned in the advertisement were not those who played  the show. Not that I was very disappointed not to see the good actors! The, if the show had started on time, it could have been much better, but it started forty five minutes late, it is too much for me! Plus, it is mentionned, on your advertisement, that discounts were available, in fact, no discount were done to me, whereas I am a student and as a student I was allowed to have a discount but I paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discount for this show. Finally, I think that this evening was very far  to be perfect, and I ask you for my money,  I spent for this horrible evening in your theatre, back. I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back. Your Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technologies are part of our daily life, everything we do is simplified by these new technologies. It is faster with new technologies to go from one place to another, for example, we can us a car or public transports such as  trains or buses instead of walking or riding as  in the past. Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too, washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done, some specific machines are made to do this stuff, it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport, relaxing... New technologies allow us to work more efficiently, with computers, complex operations can be achieved in a close time and with the insurance that the result is correct.  Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves on what happens in live, or search for  special leisure with a quick result. Finally, new technologies help us to save our free time and to work more quickly and more efficiently. ",21
886," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have recently received your letter informing   I won a two-week-holiday prize at the Camp California. Enclosing  information you asked for, there are some points, I want to point out. First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of the June so I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in  tents  than  log cabins. Since I was a child, I have been intrested in camping and sleeping under the tents. If I can participate on swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful. I have been swimming for 8 years for a club and enjoying  a lot. I am afraid, I am not good at photography but I want to improve it. I need some more information about the camp life and also I would like to know what I need to take with me. For exemple, how much pocket money will be enough and which kind of clothes I should wear.. I hope to receive your reply soon. I am really looking forward to going  this camp. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Subject: Suggestion about lessons and activities  should be filmed. A - Lessons English It is one of the most popular subject in the school. Also, because this video is their project, it should be filmed. Drama Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons, it is not very well known. Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July. Part of the show can be filmed. Maths Regarding that the school's maths team won the this year's city's maths competition and is going  to the national school's maths championship, it will be  good idea to film some of their training course and also ordinary maths lesson where the majority of the students attend. B- Social Activities To show the life at the school  is not only lessons and exams, the video should  be inclued the annual summer Fete,  school's weekend trip which is on Friday 7th of July and also the dance which is organized on the last day of the school year. ",33
292," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite deceiving. I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre, are there about five points which were not respected. To begin with, as far as the starring is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed  the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceived, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favorite actor. Apart from it, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain  me the reasons of such a huge late? Thirdly, the ad mentionned possible discounts. Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a ""perfect evening out"" at all,  as it is mentionned in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you give me my money back. I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If only Paul had knew it before... Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience. He went through  valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone, on  top of which he could stare  the whole woods. All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words ""I am glad to meet you, Paul."" The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing. How did the beast knew his name? ""You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, in your reality!"" At these words, Paul suddently awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it. Unfortunately...one our after , a local zoo  arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because of  not having  Faerian food necessary to her survival. This is how human destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream. This is how mankind can't be relied on. This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result of it. ",35
59," Dear Ms Jane Clark I am writing to you because I have some suggestion about next year festival, and if it is possible I can give you some opinions about this year festival. Firstly, in your advertisement  states: stars and artist from around the world, and this year  one only from six countries It would be great if there was more artist  not only six. Secondly, the concerts are fantastic, especially  rock concerts. I very enjoy on it, but some of the halls are too small. I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied. Another thing,  plays and films. I saw only 2 plays and 3 films. For me it is too little. One of the reasons that I have visited your art festival was to saw a lot of plays In  future I supposed to be an actress and that's way I want to learn something from  professionalists. I hoe that next year I will. The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have  weekend-price. This is  excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it by  whole family at the weekend and see all events in  reasonaby-price I believe that you consider my opinions. If you can't consider all of then, I would like only one: more and once more plays! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Annabel Thank you for your letter, and I'm sorry I didn't write. I have examinations, but now I have plenty of time and I can write a letter to you. In your letter you ask me about  rules in school and home I have. I think that they are the same as yours, but I'm not sure at 100 per cent so I vrite :  Rules at school are: we must be on time at lessons,   always have make  homework. Everybody must be present at lessons. If someone is ill  must bring a paper from a doctor. And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to  teachers At home I must clean my room and vacuuming  home. I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows. I like clean my home, and I like  when there is clean and fresh. However I'm the only child and I don't have do too much but I want  and I like it. There is one thing I like to change,  the treatment students  by teachers. They want too much forstudent and are unkindly for them. That's all, I hope that I give you answers for all  questions you have. Give my best wishes to your family Bye ",23
545," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to giving  information about myself. Even though I would like to travel, I am only  in July, because I am a high school student. Thus I have not got  long holiday. I just have one month left. Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents. On accound  to stay in log cabins are as much more interesting than  in tents. As far as two activities are concerned I would choose singing and photography. I used to win a number of competitions in singing. I can sing a plenty of songs. which include the english song and the japenese song, and I have  part-time job for sining at  restaurant. Although the photography is not as good as the singing, I am very interested in it. I have been learning  since I was 15 year old. I got third prize in it competition last year and I level is professional now. Futermore, I am going to have  competition next year. I would like to asking  some information about that what kind of clothes I have to wearing and how many your are charge. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable, sometimes have a long quare or a mechine was broken. A lot of circumsenses will have been happening. I have  unpleased experience. It was in lunch time. Everybody were went to by luch in  supermarket, in fact, nobody liked crowe and quare, expecially  in the summer time. I was quare in the middle of row. I choose this row because I though it was quicker than  other. Although there were finished two people, next was me, something was happened. Suddenly the customer though the receipt was not truth, she did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make  mistake, they argued about this thing. The shop manager was coming solution it. Abviously, I have to chance other row. I was long quare, I have never had. Shopping would be enjoyable, if you were good luck. Even though I think it most of time is very interesting, sometimes  make people upsent. ",14
646," Dear Helen Ryan I am very happy and excited because I have won first prize in our competition. It is a pleasure for me. I am writing to enquire you about some doubts and to give  information that you need about me. I have been working hard here in Portugal and I will be on holiday just in next july. Because of it I believe it is the best date for  travel You asked me about accommodations or Camp California. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in  log cabins. Another question that you asked me was about two activities I will have the chance to do there. I would love play tennis and basketball that I've been playing for six years. About tennis, I just started to play last year and I need to increase my technique too much. I would like to know something about money and clothes. Are they inclued in the prize? How much money I can spent during this time? I'd prefere  if you give me this information as soon as you can. I am look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely Rui Veloso  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am very happy with your letter that I received last week. I'm too excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month. I suppose you know about  ""Portugal Pop Concert"" that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month, aren't you? It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there. I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all  time, what wasn't very difficult. You will can't believe how many famous people I known. I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes. It was a dream and she was amazing with me. I didn't tell you, but I helped in this concert just by a chance. A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said ""yes"" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life. Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations. However, these days were unforgatable to me. Hope to hearing from you soon With best wishes, Rui ",28
95," Dear Sir or Madam, Last Saturday I went to your theatre to see the new musical show; ""Over The Rainbow"" It was writing on the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to play with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who played. That disappointed both me and the people who just went to see him. And  the Times; the show had to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, there was said  to be discounts for the ticket but I saw nothing like this. All  people there gave the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day. I had a horrible evening, just the opposite of what I expected, so I want my money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  THE BIG FAULT Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was a big fault to gave her a secret, especially an important one. It all started two years ago. Rod was a happy man at that times. One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange man, who he ran after and  caught one of whom. Just then, the strange man took out his gun. Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself ,by his own gun. Nobody saw or nobody heard what had happened. Rod told this to nobody, except Pat, his best friend. One day, when they were arguing, Pat was very anxious and told what she knew to  police. Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison. He then was killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards. Rod's grave is now in prison. And these lines writes on his gravestone: Here lies the poor body of Rod, Never give your secrets away, This is why poor Rod died. And everyone was surprised. ",29
1072," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London. I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March at 10.00 - 19.00. I would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme. It is very thoughtful of you that you are taking all of us to London. This is  great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself especially, The London fashion and leisure shows. Most of the shows are about fashinable things for the students in my age. I think it is a good programme and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of the shows for instance  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to make up and how to have propiate hairstyles. In my opionion, I think you should organised this programme in the afternoon instead of going for shopping and move the shoping time in the afternoon on Wednesday. I hope this information will help you to understand and put it in your programme. I trust you to pay immidiate attention to my suggestions. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I closed my eyes, tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower. There were hundrend of Thai students were waiting for doing this test. I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous. I was given the lists for doing the activities while I was going to the adventurous school schems at the solder camps in the north of Thailand. There were many tasks that I had to complete for instance, clime up to the mountain,  how to used some kind of guns, and how to survive when I got lost in the forest. The last task I had to do was jume out of the hight tower. The assistants were the real solder and they were very kind and helpful eventhough, they looked very strick and unkind. It was the hardest time for me to do thing like this because I lived in the city most of my life  I had never known about how to survive in the forest and how difficult to work as solders. I eventaully managed to complete all  tasks that I had given  I was very proud of this. ",24
61," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced the last 21 and 22 of November. I want you to know how  extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend. The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. On my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small, you've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Miguel Thanks for your letter. I got it a couple of days ago and I've been thinking about what you said. I'm going to tell you what I feel. In my house rules practically don't exist because I have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that I study  a carrear and be a good man. They only want to know where I am and when I go out  at what time I came home. At school  is complete different because the teachers don't foregive you nothing. You have to be quiet an attention in class if you wouldn't  to be punished. I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things. I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things. When I'd time I will write  you again Love, ",20
952," Dear Helen Ryan, I have recieved your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize. I have answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th  July is my birthday. I want to sleep in tents because I think it's more adventurous  better scenery, and atmosphere. You also asked me about the two things I'm good at, well, the first one is basketball. I have been playing basketball for roughly about 4 years. I love basketball because I'm good at it and it is my favourite sport. The other thing I'm good at is tennis. I have been practcing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 U.S open tour last summer. Last of all I have questions to ask you. Would I have to bring many clothes e.g. would we do a lot of outdoor activities, get dirty etc. Would I need a lot of money. Looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This composition is about shopping. People today shops sevendays a week with their family, friends etc. But I think shopping is not always enjoyable. This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world. The more stuff we buy the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit. You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping. ",31
389," Dear Sir, I write this letter because I find there were too many problems concerning your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". At first, I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor, but she must have been changed since the actor was different. I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre. Nevertheless, I stayed since I had paid. I also want to put the stress on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm. It is a really a shame! In fact, if I had knowned, I would have probably stayed at home. We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available. Nonetheless, there were no discounts available at all. And, we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant in so far as it was closed. Indeed, there was a little paper on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness. Consequently I ask you for some money back seeing that I think: it's not worth the bother to loose money for such a show., Thank you.  [SEP]  I think that modern technology change my daily life. Indeed, daily life is easier thanks to technology. For example, if I want to buy something, I have to go on my computer and buy it. But it will make me lazy. On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we've got more and more possibilities to enjoy ourselves since she invents a lot of products. But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes cheap and I can't afford it. In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it hadn't existed since there are too many things on  market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different marks. And it's all the more tyring since you often wait during two weeks before buying it. I'm bound to feel nervous. To put it in a nutshell, I would like to say that technology can be a good thing, but it creates many problems too. ",27
821," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm very pleased to hearing from you, and I'm glad I've got this chance to go to the Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. Firstly I must say that I'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since I started work and  intitled to have a holiday only in July. Secondly, I'd prefer to accommodate myself in one of the log cabins, as they are more comfortable, usually have central heating and other necessary facilities. Despite my appriciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I'd choose my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis. As I was a champion of  swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practice my skills. Also I like to play tennis, which is  beautiful ""game"" itself and good for  figure. In the conclusion I would like to ask if I need to take some money with me and how much? What kind of clothes will I need in the U.S.A. in July? Probably summer clothes mostly? Your sincerely, Hope to hear from you soon.  [SEP]  ""Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not"" - my English teacher has asked me on the class discussion about shopping. Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen of being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores. Despite  I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands, as prices are usually to high, unfortunately not affordable for me. Sometimes I go to the local market, but not on my own. I ask my husband or mother to come with me, as I had  bad experience in the past, when my bag with all my money was stolen. Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants which try to sale any products to the ""victim"" entring the door. Otherwise shopping is not so bad, as you get what you want in the end. ",32
251," Dear Sir, My name is Furilo J.M. and last month I spent a few days in London, I visited you theatre. The reason I'm writting this letter for you is that in my staying in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre. When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone  actually didn't appear, I noticed there in the show,  someone completely different of him so I felt bad. Moreover, this complaining is not only about the actor, who ever , the problem is that the show started too late. I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began only  20:15.  I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't have any discounts as it was written on the folder. After the show I wanted some thing on the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed. After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad. I think I can forgive your theatre, only if you give me a refund of the money I spent there, and some other more for all the problems I had. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind. Every person in the world looks for technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life. We young people don't remember when technology wasn't part of our daily life, but our parents, or grand parents remember  exactly  when they were young, and everything was made in a different way, for example our parents didn't have computers at home when they were teenagers. Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer at your house, and when you have to do a homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to the school, also you can search for new subjects on the internet. Finally, technology is a word that  will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how technology, and in which speed it will develop to the future. Maybe, technology will never stop growing and our life will never work without computers. ",24
954," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I'm writing  you replying to your letter asking for some more information about me, to give you all the information you need. First of all you asked when would I be able to travel. You ought to know that  is possible to me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole  August. Answering the second question I would prefer my accomodation  in log cabins. The reason is that, in my opinion, they are more comfortable, there's more space and in addition they are warmer. Providing that you give me the chance to chose two activities I would love to do swimming and singing. I attend to swimming and singing classes twice a week so I'm really good at both. Finally I would like to ask you about clothes and money. Where will we be able to wash our clothes during the camp? Are we allowed to carry with  all the money we wish to? Don't hesitate to contact me for any more question. Yours sincerely, Angeles.  [SEP]  Nowadays shopping is considered one of the most usual and enjoyable activities, especially if you are a woman and you are out to buy clothes. At first sight it is, but shopping is not always enjoyable. Basing my opinion on my experience I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping. There are some points that give me the reason. First of all, who is your companion? If you take  mum shopping the right day she has been all day doing housework, that will probably end in discussion. In one hand, there's you. You are feeling sick,  angry with your boyfriend. How do you pretend to see in a mirror that anything fits well on you? In the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, no   size for you or too high prices. Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys? I'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it. ",30
48," Dear Ms Clark, I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate  on the organization. I am also writting to make a suggestion and to give  my opinion for next's year festival. An internation arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were starts and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the possibility to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures. In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert, ""La Moldava"" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough, it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies. I am glad to tell you that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because also people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival. I would like to give a suggestion. I think that meeting writers, dancers, musicians and artists could be very interesting for anybody. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you very much for your recent letter. I'm very happy that you are well. When I read your letter I was surprised because I didn't know that you have so many rules both at school and at home. In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht. Nobody has to be late in the morning because it is important to respect  class mades and teachers' effort of getting up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour. There isn't a kind of punishment for people who do these things. My parents are very good. The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lays. It's important for them that I tell them where I'm going if I go out and what time I think of coming back home. I can do what I like doing but I have to study. This is the only condition  to do what I prefer. There isn't anything that I'd like to change. Write soon Love ",28
584," Madam, I am sending you this reply with the informations that you need. I would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year. About the acomodations I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to stay in it when I travel. The activities that I want to do in the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall as well as I use to play it very well. On the other hand I don't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it  cool. There is one thing I would like to ask you. It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend with food and this kind of thing. Yours Sincerely Adriano Tudela  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this  one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem. Sometimes, shopping can be really bore especially in important dates when the shop are absolutaly crowded and you can't see somethings as you wanted with carefull. ",20
391," Dear Sir/Madam! I'm a student from St. Petersburg, and I'm studing in a theatre acodimy. My freind & came to London for an excursion. We were lucky to get tickets to the ,,Over the rainbow"" show in your theatre. Danny Brook is my favorit actor & to see him was my dream from my childhood! It was a suprise when we were told there will be another actor. Also we expected to get a discounts as a students, but international students cards are not available in your theater (that is very strange - even your advertisment has an information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was postpone  45 minutes! so we were late to our supper in the hotel and  theatre restaurant was also closed without any risons . In the advertisment it was written ,,your perfect evening out!"" , but it wasn't. And I think, I prooved you this. I'm waiting for your anser and hope I can get my money back!  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed (your) my daily life? Our days I would call a days of great technologycal progress. You can find changes everywhere. Industrial weel going faster and faster. Im dealing with a mobile communication - mobile phones and papers. I can see how different firms produces more & more new mobile phone. They got more differet functions and form. It is very intresting for me how new works, there possiblyties. My job, I think is a good way to become a profesion in the future. And I hope to find a realy good job in a good company. Communication business is a very progressive. More and more people buing mobile phones, because it is very usefull, you get a lot of possiblyties like: use an internet, buy different goods, book tickets, control your home technic and many authers. Mobile communication is a key to sucsess in all professions that we have! And I think that I made a right choice in the profession - it is  perfect combination:  very progressiv way of a modern technology, and the most important thing - it is extremly interesting for me! ",21
205," Sir, I have seen your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" in London. I have been very disappointed when I had read your advertisement, I was keen on your show, but I have not seen the same show, I have seen one which it looked like, but not be . First of all I have been attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who played effectly that evening. This actors appeared with fourty-five minutes later refering which is written on your advertisement. This late forbid me   to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing! For all this reasons I do wish that I would not have been gone see that show, for which the tickets were not available. And as a conclusion I want you to give me my money back, (I have still the advertisement if you want the prooth  what I say). You have the choice, either you make what I want, or I attack you in justice. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  ""The old man and the sea"" E.H. When I have read this book, I have been fascinated by the will of the old fisher. This will is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance  to meet someone who could help him. But I don't think he would want to. He doen't want  because he wants to prove  the little  and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big age. I think this are the reasons of his will. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumph othe  fish because of his knowledge of the sea but  principally because he has known research in the deeper of his mind. To conclude I think the difficults situations allow us to discover ourself getting out of ourself. ",23
146," Dear Sir, I'm writing to complain for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I've been recently seeing  in your theatre during my week's holiday in London  I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was the London's newest and best musical show  I  had ever seen because of the good publicity you made  in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong! Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later as I expected! If the spectacle has been beautiful, I would have been quite pleased to wait. Then, I had read that there would have been discounts available, but it wasn't true! So it's better not to write anything if you don't make it  true then. Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change of  programme:  starring! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. Finished the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this hasn't been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed: the chef went away after he received a phone call! For all these reason, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon! A suggestion? Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There would be many things to say about . Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I must say  technology has changed our life in  positive  or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we  make a phone call with an astonish rapidity, instead at my grandparents' time it took one month or more to have  contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When appeared the first car, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else he wants! What can I say about the television? It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which happened or will happen. In the not very far 1914, parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible! Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community, not only phisically. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power. We became passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed. I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality. Finally, everyone should decrease his own life's rythm. ",29
1151," Dear Maria, I've recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon, here yo have a little help for it. At first, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is ""The Palace Hotel"", wich is situated at the center of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because  is very near of the conference. Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel. At the end of the conference it will be a party. I might suggest you to wear a casual dress, because many students feels  relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference. The party is amazed by a group of musicians, and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven, because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun. It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially ""the History museum"" wich I visited last year, and I think you can enjoy  as well. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free. Whising I've been very helpful to you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIFES It's imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business. We can't imagine a big company without a phone, that can makes business more quickly than anything else. Also, I was asking too many people in the street. Could you live without  telephone? The answer was all the same ""Imposible"". An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the ""Chicago University"", she told me that every night  was expecting a call from her son, for her was the line of the hapiness. However it was one persone wich he told me, it wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to writte a lot, especially at Christmas  to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion. In my opinion this little ""box"" that everybody has at home can safe your life, especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation. In conclusion don't make a very long phone calls and you won't have to pay a very expensive bill. ",23
1065," 1/3/2000 Dear Mr. Robertson. I'm a student in  English class which  going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm a representative student from my class  to thanks you about your programme that you've already organised for us. It's really wonderful especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel  can't wait until that time. However, the students in my class, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The show has many interesting parts such as  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study  Fashion and Design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion. So we think that it will be useful for all of us. Anyway, we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip. So we will have  free time on the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoy the show. I'm also include the show's leaflet on the back of this letter. What do you think about this plan? I'm looking forward to see your programme.  [SEP]  I believe that everyone in this world have curiosity. We're always want to know about others' life especially the famous one even the one that we hate. But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example when we get married or when  policeman stop us on the highway, we don't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us. Famous people are also the normal people like us just because their jobs are known by every people, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy. They also want to have  special time with their family or their friends. It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take their photographs and some journalists write the news that  not true. We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people. But it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time, they should give them some privacy. On the other hand, these stars should accept that they are famous people so everyone wants to know about their life. The best way is  they, the famous stars and the journalists, should compromise and respect each other's rights. ",32
860," 13, June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to stay in the Camp California Secondly, I will be able to travel on July because I am a manager so I can not travel another time. Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I can not sleep on the floor. I would like to sing and  photograph, I've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it. In the other hand, I can not sing very well but I would like to do this  there. I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there, would you check the weather forecast for me, please? And how much money I am going to need to have there with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely. Maria Sophia Candoso.  [SEP]  the lost wallet A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first pay and went to a shopping center to spend my money with my credit card. I bought everything I wanted. Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money? I started to look in everywhere. I've asked my mom and my friends and everybody didn't know where it was. My mom said: 'You've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.' I started to look for my wallet and I couldn't find it, lighter. Now I was without my money and my wallet. What could I do? Suddenly the door bell rang. I went to see who was there. It was and old woman asking who was Maria. 'It's me!' I said. That's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the sit of the eating-place of the shopping center that I went  that day! ",25
183," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to tell  that I saw your musical show ,,Over the rainbow"" and there were too many disappointing divergences between the advertisement for the show and the show itself. The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show. However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement. Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although, it had to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening,  I think you should know that ticket were sold without any discounts. It seems to me that all these failures were your falt, because you were responsible for the arrangement of the show. I think you ought to have postponed the show and have reimbursed me  a ticket price. However, conserning that I saw the show, I would like to get a half refund. Please reply at your earliest convinience. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology changed my daily life completely. When I saw modern technology I mean  Internet. For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend after some hours since he has written it. My friend lives in Kresnodar. My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar. And it takes 3 days to her letter to get to Kursk. That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses  post service. So with  Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time. Another change in my life is that I use  Internet as a library when I write my course papers. So that I can get books which  is impossible to get in  libraries of my town. That is why I think that modern techology helps me in my daily life. ",30
557," Thuesday 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I've just received your letter, and I am very delighted to be the winner. I thank you.. As regards to the time I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only  on July because I am very tied up  this time owing to he exam period which will last until the end of June. I'd rather have accommodation in tents, it would be a good experience for me especially because I haven't lived it as well as it is more romantic. As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do. The swimming is my best sport. I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete. The sea is part of myself. Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball, despite the fact that I am not too tall for this kind of sport. However, I used to play basketball in my school because we hadn't  other sport pitch except of the basket pitch. Finally, would you mind to send me more information about the amount of money that I should have. Also, what about the life out of the camp? Are there other places for entertainment especially for the night life? Could you send me some brochures for the place where we will stay in? Thank you again, and I am looking forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about the short video which my college is going to make about the daily life of our school. It considers two points: the lessons and  activities which should be filmed. I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful. There are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, despite the artificial sunbathing. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is  good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that  owns. In addition, we can film the library which possesses thousand of works. Books of various interest, with up-to-date facilities such as computers  internet, CD and cassettes. We shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better. Finally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim. ",32
479," Dear sir, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Threatre has presented. I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay I came to your threatre to see the ""Over the Rainbow"". My evening was very disappointing. In the advertisment, I had read that Danny Brook was starring but she was not. A different actor was playing durring the musical and he was very disappointing. The play should start at 19.30 but it started forty-five minutes later, we were waitting over there with out doing anything. We got very bored and tired. After the show had finished I went to the theatre restaurand to hav something to drink and get relaxed but it was closed because the stuff was on holiday. Moreover the discounts were not available as you say in the advertisment and I paid £20. I would like some refand because It was one of the worst evenings in my life it if this matter does not solve  I will go  further. I hope that it will be solved properly Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. He and his friends got in trouble because of this habit, last week. As they were watching T.V at Nick's house last Sunday, Sally noticed that their cut Curly was hurt,  she could not walk. The children were very unhappy and  sorry about the pet. ""Somebody had hurt her and had let her without help"" Mourk said angrily. ""We have to find him and make him pay for his action"" Sally told them. Everybod agreed with her. Suddenly Pat cried: ""Oh my Lord, Bad Jon had done this. Yesterday as I was arriving home I saw him in your yard Mack, he looked very satisfied, Curly was laying on the grass and..."" ""Yes, Oh Lord he did it because we won his team at football"" Nick said. ""He is so bad. We will make him pay. Hey Listen guys we will take his dog which  love very much and we will sell it to Sally who wants one. We will pay Curly's doctor with these money that we will earn"" Pat said. Next morning as Pat was going to school  met Bad Jon. and told  him ""Hey, you. We know what you have done and your dog will be sold"". Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father. who was the school minister about the children' plan. Of course they were punished. ",24
123," Dear Sir, I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see ""Over the Rainbow"", - the musical show -. At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement of the show, nevertheless it has wrong information. First of all, the advertisement of the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot. Appart from that, the show was delayed forty five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry. Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket, which cost me £20. Besides, the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show. Finally I would like to inform you that I had never spent such an umpleasant evening in my whole life. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you - the manager of the theatre - could send me the money back, at least the money I spent on the ticket. Your faithfully LUCCA CALZARI  [SEP]  Unfortunately Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was one of my best friends, but all secrets told to him spreaded throughout the school in a matter of minutes. The worst was that he did it unconciously. When we were in the primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) for his 10th birthday by preparing a fancy dress party in the school. We had been preparing it for three days, we hired fancy dresses, had a cake made by a cook and decorated the gymnasium. Unfortunately, it was me who had to tell Pat about the surprise. Later, I realiced it was the worst thing it could happen to me. On the day of the party, half an hour before it started, Pat came across with a gang of boys from another course. Since they were going to beat him , he desperately told them everything he knew about the party. Afterwards, all of them were around Tim telling him what Pat had confessed. Both Pat and Tim were very disappointed that day. ",28
24," Rome 16th December 2000 Dear Jane X, I'm an italian boy who went to the International Arts Festival last November and I enjoyed most of the events I went to but given that I think that the Festival could be better next year I write  you these lines in order to make you know some observations of mine about the festival. The Festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all  the world. Furthermore, and for sure it is not your fault, some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall that was often two crowded. I hope next year plays and films will be more and that the ticket will be reasonably-priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival. Friendly  [SEP]  Rome 16th December 2000 Dear Marie, I'm going to write you about rules in my country and I have to tell you that life in school isn't too hard because even if there are many rules to follow nobody does it. It's written in the regulament that we can't leave the school during the breaks; we can't smoke near the classrooms; we had to justify our absences or late-enterings and even if you're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher. At my home every rule must be respected. Even if my parents don't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you don't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends  for a Saturday night party. These are the things that I'd like to chance; I'd like to do what I really want  but I don't know if I'm really ready for this!! With love ",31
373," Circle theatre's Manager: I am writting  you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There were many things that were wrong in the advertisement I saw. First the actors who were suppoused to star in this show were not the ones put in there. So when I saw the show I felt horrible, because I was expecting to see Danny Brook. But the problems started while I arrived  the place. I had a discount for it, but they refussed it and I had to pay the full price. Appart from this, the show started fourty five minutes later. I think this reasons are suficiently enough to ask for my money back. So I hope that you will understand my point. Please be comprehensive and realize that your show was not cheap. I'm a student, so I do not have a lot of money and I need it back. I also had to tell you that the theatre restaurant was closed because there were  few people there and they take me out of the place, so I was very upset. I will go to your office this week. I hope to see you there.  [SEP]  Pat's secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about the relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John, loved each other so much that it wouldn't be rare to find that they had have sex together. The point here is, that Caroline choosed the worst friend to told this . She was also concerned about being pregned, but she was afraid to told John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat react in a very wrong way and told rapidly to John. He couldn't belived what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay  a very expensive operation. But as every story this has a happy final. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her fantasy. And Pat understood that secrets should die on your own. ",26
498," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to you to complain about your Circle theatre. First of all I must say that ""over the rainbow"" is not the London newest and best musical show, for many reasons: In your advertisement I read the times , it was 14.30 and 10.30, however it started  20.15! So I've been doing the nothing for a long time and I don't like to lose my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove?, where were they the last weekend? the last weekend in the theatre  was a different actor who was disappointing. To make the evening worse the tickets were not discounts available, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over. I want the money back, if you don't give it to me back, I will intend to write to the press and explain everything, and of course I won't be the only one. I am so furious because when I asked for  money back that day, the sir wasn't able to give it back because he would be sack. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  the secret lover Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually makes up some extra information. On day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes (as Pat likes women). The only problem was that the girl was to shy to speak to him, she wanted to keep her name in secret, and if Pat tells someone something about the letter, she won't say who  is. Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time, even eating his nails. As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it. Three days after we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, ""oh Pat don't tell  that lie again"", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter. We laughed and explained  him that we were   who wrote that letters, and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover, a real one,  don't tell anyone because  he won't meet her. ",22
641," 13/6/2000-11-07 Dear Madam Helen Ryan First of all, we  happy to  won the first prize on your competition. Thank you for choosen our ticket at the final. We  like to go on July, because my wife Catrin just have holidays next month. We  prefer the last two weeks on July. Would that be fine for you too? Is there a possibility to stay in a log cabin. I have sometimes troubles with backache when I coud't sleep on a flat ground. It would be great if we can choosen swimming and Golf. My wife Catrin is a local master on swimming race. Im not so good as her, but I'm going every week once to her training . In Golf, we are both total beginners. We have no experience but we  like to learn this game. We are both a little afraid, what kind of clothes and shoes  we have to take off with us? Which temperature will be on the summer season in this area? Are there some possibility  to rent the golfshoes? Finally, we  like to know, when you will send us the airline-tickets and the tripbrochure. Moreover, what do  think how much pocketmoney we will spent on this trip. We  looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Leon Hofmann  [SEP]  13/6/2000 Dear Kim Thank you very much for your last lovely letter. I'm fine. How are you? You are interessted on my last job! I really like to tell you all  my experience. However, I'm happy that we finished this hard work. I worked in a team by seven people. We were mainly on work for all the lights at this great concert. Its sounds easy, just for the light. In addition, it was a nine days  hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds of Coblights on the right place. Finally, we had worked the hohl night befor the concert. We had to adjust the laser extremly  on the correct position. We spent hours  till it was good enough for the Technical-manger. Moreover, the band was exhausted about this great laser show at the end. For me was this aventure one of the Best. It shows , when all member of a group work hard together, you can reach a lot. I think I can't forgotten this experience on my mind Lots of Love Leon ",17
121," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW THAT IS TAKING PART IN THE CIRCLE THEATRE. I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY. THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING. IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'. BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT. I THOUGHT IT WILL BE AT 19.30 AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN ADITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET. SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER. TO SUM UP, I DID NOT SPEND A PERFECT EVENING. I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD. ON THE WHOLE, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. YOURS FAITHFULLY MANUELA BELABARA  [SEP]  JUST BE YOURSELF IN, THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW. PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. ONE THE ONE HAND, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES. THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE. NOWADAYS, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED. ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING, WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES. ON THE WHOLE, CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE. IN MY OPINION, PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT. ",27
464," To the manager of the Circle Theatre in London I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London a few time ago. I had enjoied to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago; and the actor's Danny Brook performance. I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but, with my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain here until the end because I  left London, with my group before the end of the show. The star, the actor Danny Brook, there wasn't in the musical show but there was an other actor, with my great disappoint. Then, in the program I could read  a discount available for the tickets, for the groups, but I couldn't have that. I couldn't have all the things I expected. That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied about your informations and I ask  some money back. I hope in your answer and in your explanation about this. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Some days ago, when the school was ending, Pat and her friends decided to make a party for their friend, Frances, because the end of the school  and the Francis's birthday were  the same day. That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided  the program and the present, a new gold watch. Peter and Sue asked to Francis  some help for their exam's subjets and Francis, for to help them, was very busy all the week. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments,   tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this. In the afternoon she had phoned at a Francis's mother and she explained her the secret, then she phoned at her best friend and she speak about that too; she phoned at many people all the day. Now many people knew the secret but Pat said everyone: ""I  tell you a small secret, but you don't speak , please!"" In the night Francis was invited to the party, at Pat's home. When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner, a his friend, ask him if he was very happy about his present, the new gold watch, he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends. The Francis's secret was discovered! Now all the Pat's friend don't tell her about their secrets because Pat isn't very good at keeping secrets.  ",23
344," To the manager of the Circle Theatre. I went to see Over the rainbow Show, Friday evening the 16/6. The musical had been advertised to be London's newest and best musical, but all to my disappointment. I had been looking forward to see my favorite  Danny Brook, but he had been replaced by some other actor. I was not too happy about that and why didn't the theatre start when it was suposed to start? (45 min late), and where were the discounts which were  available? Your advertisement was ful of false advertising. In the end of the show I was looking forward to have a nice dinner in the restaurant together with my boyfriend, but it was closed, because you were short of staff. This was not my perfect evening out. I want to have at least half of my money back. I hope you preciate my letter and that you'll try to improve the disadvantages./ Sally Svenssen  [SEP]  How has modern technology Changed my daily life? The modern technology like  internet for example has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways. The advantages with  internet are that I can do all my shopping from  internet. I don't have to stress around in the supermarket  a friday evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the groseries I need delivered to my door. Instead. I buy all my clothes on  internet as well and it works brilliant, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with  internet too. I don't get as much exercise as I used to get. Nowdays I spend 2 hours intent of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people. I have got friends over the whole world now. I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my internetfriends. The modern technology open new and exciting ways for us. I don't think that I had been going to Japan if it wasn't because of  internet. Internet has opened  a whole new world to me. Sally Svenssen ",29
768," Thank you for your answer. I'm happy I can join you at Camp California in the U.S.A. I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only on July because I just started my new job and I got one month of my holiday, which are on July. You wrote to me that I can choice my accommodation. I would prefer stay in log cabins because I have a problem with my back it is a reason that I can't lie on the ground. Beside that I'm alergic,  that make me problem when I'm close to the nature. You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can choice. I'm quite good in paiting and I play tennis. I'll be very happy when you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some paiting's materials like oil paints canvas and bruches for me. The size of the canvas isn't so important. I have my own sports equipment to play tennis. I hope I'll have  possibility to improve my ability in it. I'm champion of my town, so I think I can find a right person who can play with me. Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather do you have in this time of the year. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite polish group ""THE CULT"" in Warshaw. I had the chance to help at the concert. You can't imagine how happy I was. I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot. You know I'm good in mace-up and I have done many times scenography. They were pleased that I can do two of this job that's why I got the work. I was working like crazy but I enjoyed  a lot. I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they made the concert. Could you imagine that they asked me to make the summer scenography. I heard, the atmosphere of their concerts is very hot but I didn't know they like to create this even by scenography. Could you believe that two nights I was cutting paper's flowers, grass, the sun and thousands of birds. I didn't have many people who was helping me that's why I was working 48 hours without stopping. I think the result of that action was marvelous. Everybody was very suprise that you can create such amazing things, using a sizors and papers. I like a lot the mountains which I made. From the distance they looked very real. I just rulled a paper and I painted a little white colours on the top. In front of the stage I put the grass and a lot of flowers. The light on the stage was very bright and very warm what's made the scenery very pleasent. After that I prepared the group. I done  mace-up for them. I was very happy because on this time I had a chance talking to them and to know more about them. They are very nice people even Audrey who seems very stupid. She is very intelligent. I really don't know why she behave herself so badly during her interview. I got their address so we can visit them one day. I told them about you and they said we are very welcome any time. I told them you are full of live and they are yours favourite polish group. They  like to know you a lot. We'll speak about it when I come to see you. I hope to see you soon. A lot of kisses. ",23
55," Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to you to tell you that I enjoyed the International Arts Festival held on 21-22 November this year. I liked the plays and the films most. Some films were really wonderful. You had picked up unknown but talented directors' films and they were really worth watching. And the concerts were also excellent. Especially, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore. However, I found some things which I think I should point out. Some concert halls were not big enough to have the audience. For next year, I think you should take this matter into consideration, And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films. I will definitely go to the festival next year, too. To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments on it. Best regards.  [SEP]  A Japanese folk story ""a bamboo princess"" There was an old married couple. They had no children. One day, the lady went to a river to wash  clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees. In a bamboo forest, he found a shining  bamboo. When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it. She was named  bamboo princess. The princess grew up  beautifully. Some princes proposed  her. But she said to them, ""if you want me, you have to do this."" and asked them to do impossible things because she didn't want to get married. One day, the old couple saw the princess crying. When they asked her , she said ""I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon"". They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her. But, one the day, the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her. This story happened a long time ago. ",29
454," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which gave me a very disappointing evening, while I was staying in London. Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor, Danny Brook. That made me so disappointed. Secondly, I suppose the show will start at 19:30, but it started t 20:15. It caused me missed the train and I went back to the hotel  nearly in the mid-night. Another problem is, I realised that the discounts were available. However, there wasn't any discount. Additionally, the advertisement said I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show. When I arrived, it was closed. That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice. I expected to receive the money back within these two days. Otherwise I would like to take the other action. Your faithfully, Silvie.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrects. I told Pat everything even my secrects when we were still friendly. However, we are not friends anymore because of a secrect in the past. It was a very long time since I was in Year 7. I told Pat that my father and mother were going to seperate. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feeling. May be it was a wrong decision to tell her, she began to spread that secrect to everybody including the teachers. They tried to contact with my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what happened. All my friends were trying to kept a distance with me. That was all because of Pat. At last, I decided to go to the other school and I will not tell any secrect to the others. ",27
576," 14.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very glad I won the competition. This trip will, undoubtedly be a wonderful experience. As far as the dates of travelling are concerned, the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the remaining  summer. I really didn't expect to win the trip. I would therefore be very thankful if you could book the tickets for then. Concerning the accommodation choice you have proposed me, please make sure I am sleeping in a tent, as I have never experienced open air camping before. I think it would be nice to try it at least once. Concerning the proposed activities please, accept me for Singing and Painting. The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad. Concerning Singing activities, I think I'm quite good as I have been in my school's choir for 3 years. Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  17 October 2000 Dear Kim, As you asked me, I write  you about my experience at the Pop Concert. Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big stress about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people. There were 963 persons in the ""Armaggedon"" that night! But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other way to meet the ""New Bentley"" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one  I shared a meal with Paul McPartney. I'm sure you are jalous now. Don't worry they still organise these ""youth work"" programs. With love John ",32
677," Dear, Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize at camp California in America. For the time that I would like to travel  must be on July only. This is because my A-levels exams is coming up so I really need times to revise, and July is the only month and time that I am free. An accommodation, I  prefer to stay in a tent. This is because it is my first time to see an outside world by myself so I need to gather up new experiences. I have never ever stayed in a tent before but some of the people I know said that it is fun and much more exiting. As I am a person who is love and doing activities, so I would like to choose to do sailing and photography. Once I used to take a photography course at my school and my teacher taught me well about taking photo. Also I tried how to sail before, but I am not perfectly good at it, but I  love to sail more. Finally, I would like to ask about what kind of clothes do I need to bring? and the money, do I need much of them? Please, give me a suggestion about these . Your faithfully  [SEP]  Dear, Kim How are you? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I ever have. Last week I offered myself to help the others at the concert and it was amazing. I couldn't believed how close I was to the band. There were so many youngsters at the concert, but because I was the youngest in a helping team so I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment. A concert did very well and I enjoyed it so much. Later on the band took a break for ten or fifteen minutes, so I served them with glasses of fizzy drink and chocolate bars, biscuits and sandwiches. You will not believe how close I was to the singers. After a break, the bank have to carried on  the concert for another one hour and a half. People at the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and  ready for the end of the concert. The time has come, when the band finished the concert, we have to served them drinks again and helped to clear up the stage. Afterwards, I have a chance to took photos with them and have their autographs etc. It was the enjoyable time in my life and  wished that you were there with me. From this letter, I am sure that you should be able to share this experience with me. Lots of Love ",32
175," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theatre. Unfortunately your advertisement about it wasn't true! Firstly, it's written that  it will be played by Danny Brook, but in fact it wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard about it. In addition to this, the timetable 19.30 wasn't correct. We've lost our time waiting outside in the cold  that the doors would get opened 45 minutes later. Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a reduce. Again, it wasn't true. When I enquired about the discounts, at the cashier they told me that they didn't have any information about it. At least, after all my disappointments when I wanted to visit your restaurant, it was closed because it was too late. I think that you are not a good manager. Therefore, I should be grateful if you would send me back some money for all the disagreements I've had in your theatre. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is my best friend. We spent all our childhood together usually driving our parents mad. As we grown up, we were getting closer and closer sharing all our love stories and even more. I'm certain, that our friendship is stronger than other people. But I do have a problem with her. Pat isn't good at keeping secrets. Even worth, she is not able to keep anything . For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday asking all . friends  to close their mouths. All did except one: Pat. Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately driving too fast I drove through the front gate. I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them. Of course, the following day all my family had heard about my odd story. In conclusion to this, why do I still go on with her, it's the fact I love her as well as my sister and I know that she can change it if she would because last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.

13," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing this letter to give my opinion on the last International arts festival. Firstly I found amazing the number of starts and artist who came to the festival although they where from only six countries around the world. The concerts and the dance show were incredable, except for the classical concert that   halled to small. Secondly the plays and films were very good organized despide being  short number. I suggest  to do a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new life style and society, it was totaly different from ours. The talks by writers were very tecnic but it could be understood by all the people who were in the festival In conclusion, I am impresed on all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price has been excelent because there wasn't any limit of hours. I hope that you organice this festival for all the following years. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Alice, How are you? I'm pleased to hear from you. As you already know I go to an English school, Bear House, in Spain. The rules in my country are standart, I mean, the rules are very similar to other countries in Europe. At school you aren't allowed to bring  connected movil phones although there are more than one student that does it. Teachers will take it from you if it rangs during school hours. As well you aren't allowed to bring drugs or arms, to smoke or to drink alcohol inside the school. You have to respect other peoples opinion, teachers, school's material and people who works in the school. If you broke one of these rules you could be expulsed for a week, a month or for ever. At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful with my parent's time table. I can go out at night once a week if I tell them were I'm going to be. In case I lie  them or don't explain my plans that my friends and I have I want be able to go out. As well have the responsability  to look after my brother in case they aren't at home. Answering to you question I won't change nothing because I think that these are the minimum rules that a theenager have to have to be responsable in a future. love ",29

716," Dear Sir/Madam, I have received your letter and I would like to reply for it. To begin with, I can join the camp only in July. My school starts a summer holyday from 1st July and I am going to take a summer course from August. Therefore, I would like to travel in the middle of July. I also would like to prefer log cabins for accommodation. It seems more comfortable than tents. Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis for activities. I have been belonging to a swimming club and I got second prize in a competition last summer. I am good at tennis as well as swimming. Finally, I would like to ask you about clothes and money. What short of clothes should I prepare? According to your letter, all travel costs are included in your service, however, how much pocket money do I need? I would be grateful if you would give me more information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Rie Tanizaki  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Most people like shopping. Especially it is one of the hobbies for women. Basically, shopping is fun, but is it always enjoyable? There are some advantages when people go shopping. They can refresh, reduce ther stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted. Moreover, if they buy some nice things at  sale, they must be very satisfied. However, shopping sometimes make them stressfull. People often waste money for unvaluable things. Then, they really regret it. On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one. In addition, a shop assistant gives them a wrong advice. To sum up, there are many disadvantages as well as advantages. If people want to enjoy shopping, we must consider before buy something - do I really want it? I also recommend a window shopping. It is the best way to enjoy shopping. You do not have to waste money at all. ",27
1000," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan With reference to the letter from you. I would like to inform  some further information as follow. First of all, I am able to joy the camp only in July because then will be my school holiday. I would prefer tents to long cabins because I think it will be more interesting and exciting than live in long cabins. I am also interested in swimming and sailing, I am always go to  swimming pool when I have time, our family used to live near the sea side, we would go sailing on the weekend and I miss it very much Finally, I don't know much about there, is there anything should I bring with me? What is the weather going to be like? Because I want to know what kind of clothes should I bring with me? And how much meney should I have? I look forward to hearing from you. yours sincerely RATTANAKOSIN AREVA  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining way. Some people when they are in a sadness, they will go shopping to forget every thing and the fact is that every body knows how to shopping. If you have chilldren, you will know it very well  when you are busy doing something and the chilldren see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometime they even cry or shout to you and it is really anoy you. However they are happy after they have it. Anyway, even in families they usauly have this problem that when they bought a new one, suddenly they have a problem that where the old one is going to be and that is the begining of  argument between mother and farther or parents and chilldren. Eventually I like shopping to and I beleive every body like shopping, but before you buy something think before  you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough meney for survive.

814," Dear Helen Ryan, I am so glad that I have won this competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in the middle of July because my summer holiday starts in the middle of July. Is it possible to travel in July? And also I like to camp in a tent, because it will be more interesting than log cabins. You need to do everything by yourself. Taking a photography during the holiday is  very good memory for me, and I can share my adventures to my friends. So while I am at the Camp I like to take many photographies and climb a mountain. Fresh-air, flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have. By the way, I wonder if I need a lot of money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Finally, thanks for giving this opportunity to me I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely 13/06/00  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping sounds very enjobleable and  fantastic for women. You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected. Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes. Nowadays in a family shopping isn't  women's job. In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things. It will be very awful. However, shopping has pros and cons, it depends on personal thinking. I enjoy shopping very much, it can let me know what's going on in the world. But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping ,  you won't feel so tired. ",24
1159," Dear Mrs. Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to give you the information you requested. We are holding the conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel - banqueting room at 2.00 pm on Sat. 24 June. The nearest tube station is Lancaster Gate. As you know, we've been working very hard all this term. So we've decided at the end-of-conference party, we will have a buffet and a disco party. Our students, then will get to know each other well. I would suggest everybody to wear a casual dresses. Finally, I would recommend you and your group to enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby. I look forward to see you and your group soon. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]  To: The group leader From: Re: The Barbican Centre. As you requested which is the interesting building to visit. I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city. It located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station. The Barbican Centre built in 1975. Apart from Banks and important offices. There are also  world stock market exchange, an opera theatre, shopping arcades,  books and records stores. It also held an internation exhibition all year round. Recently, the exhibition of africa just finished. The opening time starts from 7.30 AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed. The building is huge with high technology and construction and a tight security. It  upgraded the building every year. The Barbican Centre is a very important building in London. You and your group will visit one building which has so many places in this building. So that you can spend your time in one go. ",25
114," Dear Sir/Madam, During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" but, unfortunately I was very disappointed. At first, as I have read in your advertisement, Danny Brook should have stared in this show. A different actor has appeared, but I must say that he was very disappointing. Secondly, you have written that the musical starts at 19:30. I had to wait for the show for over fourty five minutes, because it started at about 20:15! What is more, it has been written that I can get some discounts, but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket, it was impossible. You have also placed a note about your theatre restaurant opened after the show. I wanted to drink a coffee but, unfortunately it was closed, because the waiter went out! To sum up, I must say that this evening out was supposed to be perfect. It was not of course, so I would like to ask you kindly for my money back, because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At first, there are now a lot of things that most people use at home. For example: a fridge, a cooker or just an electricity. We couldn't imagine our life without them. Secondly, thanked to the technology, there are many ways of travelling today. We produce cars, trains and plains which are better and better. What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe it will be a remedium against AIDs or cancer soon. On the other hand, the modern technology has some disadvantages. The main  is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world. The second is the nuclear weapon and  many wars, in which modern equipement is used. To sum up, as far as I am concidered, modern technology has changed my life completely. On the one hand it helps me a lot in daily life, but on the other I'm afraid of the future everyday. ",26
815," 13 of June, 2000 Dear Helen I am really happy to receive  letter about Camp California from you. I am exciting and looking forward to doing camp there. I would like to travel in July because I have an important exam in September. Plus, it may be lovely weather at that time in  U.S.A. I would prefer log cabins. To tell the truth, I want to stay in both, but I have never stayed in log cabins before, so I would try  new style for me! I would like to choose singing and tennis. I used to go to KARAOKE with my meats in Japan as I really like to do that, anytime. On the other hand, I have played tennis for nearly 7 years and it is also one of my hobbies. If possible, could you please let me know information about the way of getting there, e.g. airport information?? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim Hello, Kim! It's been ages to write letters to you. How was your exam? I believe it went well! By the way, last month I was in that pop concert which you mentioned in your last letters. Can you believe it? Actually I helped and support to sell tickets at the reception. I've sold tickets before but not in that kind of big pop concert. Before it was packed into by  audience, we had to clean around the reception, but totally it was really exciting although I was just a  staff in the small reception, because I felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queing. I liked that especially. I don't like to tidy up, you know!! I like to face people whom even I don't know. Foremost, after finishing my work, I could meet singers by chance!! That night was brilliant and class! I keep that in my mind,  ever! Anyway, hope to hear from you shortly. See you. Love From ",24
1076," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing, on behalf of the students in my class, to thank you very much for the trip to London. Besides  , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, which was advertised in the newspaper ""Metro"" yesterday. This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 o'clock. All my classmates are very interested in this show, which includes  latest fashions, Leisure and sports wear, Make up, and Hair styles. Moreover, one of the important thing for us is that entrance fee is free for students, because students are generally short of money. We would like to suggest you change  shopping date to Wednesday afternoon, because we have  free time on Wednesday afternoon. We would be very pleased if you could consider our recommendation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Private Life For Everyone. Everyone deserve  private life. However most famous people, for example football player and film stars, have not got any privet life. They feel exhausted to be followed by journalists  Even they have an argue with journalists as they sometimes write unreal news. On the other hand, some people need journalists to be more famous, because people can have news who are famous through journalists. As a result, journalists should respect their life and always write real news. ",19
897," Dear Mrs Ryan, In reply to your letter recieved  the 13rd of June, I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been choosed. First of all, you've asked me when I wanted to travel. In fact their would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and beginn a practical trainning the 1rst of August. To continue with the others information you need, I would prefer to sleep in  tent because of the proximity to the nature. Furthermore, I've choosed two activities whose are Sailing and Climbing. I've climbed for 3 years as I was at school and I think that my level is still not too bad. In contrary, I've never sailed in my life and would enjoy to start with at Camp California. To end with, I would like to know how much money we will need for the free time and what kind of clothes and materials do I need to practise the activities I've choosed. I would like to thank you for all, and am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely Victoire Bouchard  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I've well received your last letter and want to thank your for the pictures you've joined with. You've asked me how was the Leysin Rock Festival, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and unexpectable it was. As you know, I was there to help for the good running of the concert and there was a lot of different things to do. First, I had to control the tickets at the entry. In addition, there were some VIP's to place. Then, during the concert I've helped to serve the beers at the bar. I've met a lot of interresting people while I was serving . Furthermore, I had to make announcements at the loudspeaker for the children who where lost. All was very interresting, but what I particularly liked about the experience is the human relations. I've met a lot of different people and they all have learned me something new about behaviour or compation. I hope we will see us as soon as possible and  am waiting for your answer. Love Victoire xxx ",25
1172," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writting  you to reply your question about the conference in London. thank you for your letter. I am very pleasant to know you decided to come to the ""II International conference of Human Rights"" which will be celebrated in Albert Hall college  next 25 of June. I would like to inform you that the group you belong to, has been booked in  Palace Hotel, in the center of London from the 24  June until  25 of June. The Albert Hall College, the building where will be taken part the conference is sited near Green Park Avenue; so, to get  it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station. It takes about 10 minutes. Therefore, that's the faster way of transport you can choose. The Conference will start at 9 am of 25 June and will finish about 6 pm in the same day. During the day  is supposed having a break of half and hour at 12 p.m and finally,  a party for all the people who will be there. That will be a smart party and because of this, it will be required a well-dressed and immaculate presence. Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit. As I can see from your letter, you will have about three hours before you catch your plane, so, I would suggest  to visit The Tate Modern Museum, where you will can find several interesting pictures such as Dali's  Warhols. If you need some more information or details about he conference, you can contact Alexia on 0033*** phone. I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit. Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings, for this reason I would suggest them to visit 1) ""Fontana di Trevi"" sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome. That's a small square where there is a fountain very big. It was built by  Canovas architect in 1638. That is the fountain  which  ""Dolce Vita"" film was taken place. 2) For other hand, there is  Villa Borghese Building, That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and, Bernini, who stayed for a long time working in Rome. CONCLUSION I would recommend  them the buildings because: 1) First of all, there are sited in the center of Rome so, they can take a bus to get  them move and around the city. 2) Secondly, they can enjoy visiting museums, and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the ""pizzerias' and restaurants near these famous places. In conclusion, they could combine art, the history and the night  visiting one only place  without spend much money. ",28
1237," Dear Mrs Smith, I would like to thank you for your letter. I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown cannot attend the conference. Please transmit him my best wishes for his recovery. We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel. It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximetively one mile away. There is a direct bus link between the two locations: this is  bus line number six; the bus station for the conference building is called ""Avenue de cour"" and the one at the Palace Hotel is named ""Main station"". Concerning the party we do not have a casual dressing code. students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a mid-long skirt or dress for the girls. There are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon. I would like to suggest visiting the ""Ethnographic Museum,, which is kind of unique in the world. Looking forward to meeting you soon I remain, yours sincerely.  [SEP]  The car: I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries. Nowadays more than the percents of the world industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, gasoline extracting and refining, tyres recycling, and so on. The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone. At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was  kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed according to this social evolution. The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure are now creeting problems. A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries. People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility. This will be a tough challenge for this new century. ",29
505," Kowloon, Hong Kong. July 17, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writting to complain about a musical show  last weekend when I was in London. I felt very upset about  you advertisement was totaly different between  the musical show. Firstly, I could not buy a discount ticket as you mentioned. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 p.m instead of 19:30 p.m. Thirdly, a theatre restaurant was being closed. But the worst thing is the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove., It was really  let me down!! How dared you could show ""You perfect evening out"" in you advertisement. It was very rediculous! To be honestly, I would like you could return the money back to me. And explain what had happened. I look forward to hearing  you return back. Thank  for you patience. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Although, Pat is very smart and intelligent. She like to talk with other people. She has a open-mind. So, she  got many friend Lily was one of her best friend before three year. She enjoyed sharing everthing with Pat whatever what it was. Nick was Lily husband. Her husband was being fried  last year. Lily felt very nervous about their financial problem and their future. As they went to getting a baby. She told to Pat about what had happened in her family. And what she was worried. Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other  what about his private . She told to Pat that she didn't want  other people know  it except her. Pat also promised not to tell other people. But in one  gathering party, their friend want to show their concern,  they went to ask about Nick and send him  sympathy. This let Nick very embrassed and  got hurt. Finally, they got seperated. Today, Pat and Lily still are friend. But Lily never tell her what she really want  and what her really thought  the thing. Pat felt very sorry about that   was too late. ",22
862," 13 June 2000 Dear Ms. Ryan, I am very pleased to be the winer in your competition. I almost could not believe it when I received the letter you had sent. I have never won a prize like this. Thank you  indeed! I am working as a Mechanical Engineer for a well-known car company and I would like to travel in July because this the only month I can use my annual leave. During this exciting holiday I would prefer staying in a log cabin. The reason for this is that I have got a difficulty in sleeping in tents. When I was at the Univercity I was very keen on basket ball and I was playing in  Univercity's team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque. Also I am a quite good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to join Basketball and Swimming activities while I am at the Camp. There is something I need to ask you; I don know exactly what is California's weather lime. What kind of clothes  I need to bring with me? Also, what is the currency in California and how much money  I need to take with me? I am looking forward to your reply! Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Novadays our shopping habits seem to be changed. I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop. Yes! There was only one shop in the area where I used to live until we moved to Oxford. I was really astonished by all these shopping centers like ASDA, HOMEBASE, ex. One day I decided to go to the shopping center which is only 40 meters from our house. Firstly, I could not find the entrance. I'd walked arround  about 15 minutes until I found the door. I realized that I'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window. When I entered into the shope I was a bit angry. I was holding a peace of paper which my mum gave to me. There were written all things I had to buy. But no way! I started looking for the food products written on the paper but I found only the eggs, milk and bread. Nothing else. So what was all that about?! I wasted 2 hours to buy food which you can find in every local shop. Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top. ",32
1189,"  Dear Maria, First of all, I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill. As the conference must go on, I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference. According to the hotel, the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place  we are going to have the conference. The hotel is The Palace Hotel. It'is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference. About the party, we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel  you will stay. The party will be in a friendly atmosphere so don't worry about what to wear. There will be only our group, so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves. Lastly, what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours, for some people who want to go shopping. The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel, however, some people may want to just wait at the hotel, having a cup of coffee. The cafe in the hotel is available. I hope that  information will be useful. If you have any questions I am more than happy to help. I look forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Could you live without this? Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had gone. How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work. How would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without  toaster!!! How would you cope with all those? Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances. The electricity is a clever invention. Everything bases on the use of electricity, for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information! Life wouldn't be easy if we didn't have electricity. The electricity is very important in keeping our lives go. No matter where you are, what you do, apparantly, you need the electricity. Let's think  this way, if we didn't have the electricity, there would be no other inventions at all!! I, personally, couldn't live without the electricity. It has already affected and play a great role in my life. I watch the television and use the computer everyday. Moreover, other facilities in my house,  telephone, air-conditioner, fridge, for example, they are all need the electricity. That'is why it is very important to my life. ",37
1162," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. I would be very pleased if I can help you answering all your enquiries. The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would suggested you to walk along New Street, which is the one next to  river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel in your right hand side. The hotel is just opposite to the City Hospital. As you already possibly know, the end-of-conference party will take place at the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. Answering your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all. With reference to the last afternoon, if I were you I would visit the City Museum. There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country. If you have any time left you ought to go to the High Street, where you could go shopping. Please, do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information. I look forward to meeting you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES! The invention without no doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car. Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not refering only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well. Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets. Could you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people nervous,  sometimes really upset and violent. But, anyway, people use cars. If we don't use them we suffer from them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle. Isn't that contradictorious? To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh, non-polluted air, I use my car, which, as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all. Therefore I am thinking in selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places, and change my life for a new life: whithout  car.
