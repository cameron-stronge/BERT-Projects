2190,15125,6,"The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building and not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared.",3,0.75

1478,4278,2,"Certain books should be removed from, the library because of the materials an  the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all.     The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things. Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library. They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures.     Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading. Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book.     Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them. Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies.     In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all. They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff.",4,0.6
1260,809,1,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I use to spend three hours online everyday. I did not get any exersice at all. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietbeaties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost alot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on colledge and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life. Computers incourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank acounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate by the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low life scums and criminals. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world.",9,0.7
2087,4692,2,"Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child? When you sang this song did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it? How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about but it was rated @CAPS1 so you weren't allowed to watch it. That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project. Containing inappropriate language and terms. There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read. But over all there is the government who censors things going on around the world. Censoring can have good and bad qualities.     In my experience I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more. But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials you would see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad, rarely any good news comes around. For example if something were to happen in @LOCATION1, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason. If there was movie that was made that was racist against @CAPS2 people the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to be censored.     I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population. A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored. People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden for them, could be valuable information.     In reading I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But in the other hand if they believe that it's for the good of the society then they accept the fact that it's not good for them. People also want to be given the right to make their own decisons. In a censored civilizaton they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government.     Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad, most people want to know the truth rather than a lie. Censorship is just bad in general, people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch.",4,0.6

Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web you in existance studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found a website conataining information relevant to their research that was than a book. Computer are the reason that research has contuined to thrive and @CAPS2 continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websited such as youtube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative, second, jaming websites are a less expensive, but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic, without leaving your couch wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it isn't necessary? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. In conclusion, computers impact proper in many positive ways. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society.

A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo.

We didnt know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I.

I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time.

You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet.

1060,21261,8," We couldn't control our selves, our eyes watering, and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move. I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON1 and I did in @CAPS2 grade.

First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier.

Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equaly. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.      I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.     In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others.

2103,3674,2,"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.

856,3557,2,"What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest.     Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials.     Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure.     Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library.     I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment.

1941,4725,2,"Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs.      @CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide!",4,0.6
2125,3513,2,"In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent.     Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well.     I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand.      Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music.     There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone.     I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time.    In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it",3,0.4
1191,161,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memerize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do, you don't have to serch the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.",10,0.8

No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk?

When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate.

Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnt get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnt believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance.

We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents.

I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship.

There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. That doesnt make any sence at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children.

2223,21097,8,"Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH1 laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. ""@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important. ",46,0.72

1172,1454,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy.

In an attempt to outstrip the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The place where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refule, had more hype than study. The biggest obstacle the builders faced was safety. Since most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were very flammable. If the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" had blown up above a more densely populated area than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As paragraph @NUM1 states, if the mast were a success, the weather would prove to be fatal. Even if the ship were tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around. The U.S. Navy tried to tie up next to the mast-before a law was passed not allowing aircraft the fly so low-but the wind may their efforts futile.

I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers. ",10,0.8

By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions",4,0.6

2328,4585,2,"Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world.

2500,3794,2,"Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way.",3,0.4

Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section.

1735,4761,2,Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the @ORGANIZATION1 or the @CAPS1 of your state.      If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything.     What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with.      Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. @PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in @LOCATION1.      I personally think he was in fact born in the @CAPS2.S . But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with.     I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.,3,0.4
1140,3268,2,"Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library",3,0.4

927,4089,2,"I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not.

I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting their and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you never been to area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not thy exercising. @MONTH1 be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds. You could always try that.

I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @CAPS1 research about the past. Also I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present.

61,1729,1,"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day.",8,0.6

259,4766,2,"In todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work.     One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, @CAPS1 books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many @CAPS1 authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them.      Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above @NUM1 should be a definent no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out.     Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine @CAPS3, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation.     America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.",5,0.8

2424,243,1,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You mcan e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if. you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps 'me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching.

Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along.",42,0.64

2120,114,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do put possitive affect on people and it also teaches us. So I think computers are very important and they are needed in people lives. We learn information about the world and about what is going on. It also helps us comunicate with friends and family. Lastly it can help us gather information for homework and projects. First, while we are on the computer it tells us baout the world and different countries. The computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing. The computer also gives us information about local news such as weather, traffic reports and if there has been a crime that has happended. We also can find out about the stockmarket which is very important to many people. Second, the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family. AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all different ways to interact with each other. Also if we didn't hand something in at school we could always just e-mail our teachers the information that they might need by a spacific date, if a student forgets what the homework was we can just ask on the computer. Many people find old friends that they haven't seen in years, and getting to see them again and how their family is, it could make someone feel happy about knowing that their old friend has grown happy. Lastly, if students have project or homework that they need information on the computer could always help. On the computer there is a lot of information about people, places, thing, and anything you want to know. The computer gives you answer to question you @MONTH1 have. You can get pictures and information of the thing you are looking up. It also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up. Computers are very useful when it comes to sudents education. In conclusion, Computers are a very important part of everyones life. To learn about information that is happening in the world, to talk to friends or family, and to help with school work. Even if people aren't exercising they are increasing their education by finding information. You can still enjoy nature, but not as much as ussuall; you still spend time with family and friends by comunicating on the computer. Computers are one of the gratest inventions, and does have a positive effect on people. ",8,0.6

963,1626,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bulling, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebodys email. Also cyber bulling could be anybody. Some one you knkow or someone you don't. computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always come, out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typeing an essay or something you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducieng cyberbulling. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don't learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.",8,0.6

Lastely, if you have a project you have to and it involves pictures and you dont know how to find it all you just to do is go on the computer find what you searching for and then we are done after you found everything that you see @CAPS2 to let students use computers insde classroom/schools for the they can get easy help.",6,0.4

Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it.

Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind.

133,889,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend.

1865,14923,6,"In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.",3,0.75

226,3077,2,"It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be.

Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper.

Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much.

The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. All though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. Another obsticle the buildors had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in New York such as a populated are as downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". Even though the empire state building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building.",3,0.75
325,16060,6,"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite aparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passangers and bystanders safety. The dirigible could become uncontrollable putting many lives in danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building.",2,0.5

The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneer who have changed humanity. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @CAPS6 third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy.

2100,21511,8," One day on a stormy night i had gone to the wood shed to get some wood. The wind was thrashing the trees and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking to the moon. I was taking one piece at at time trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me. As I watched my step i lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head. My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to my body unconscious. He took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In doing so he accidentally locked the door from the outside which locked him and me in the shop. As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache all i could remember happening was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS2 was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock as well. He told me what had happened with the door getting locked and how we would never get out till morning. I looked around trying to find something to get the door off but couldn't find out what anything was. My parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the gloomy side we decided to make some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again. As we made up a game called @CAPS1 we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed at the same jokes. as we laughed the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp. after three hours it seemed that we were both getting hungry and i had a couple snacks in my pockets. so we sat by the furnace and ate and told jokes about our friends and our parents and the laughing kept us cheered up for another three hours. After a while we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky like a ghost leaving this world to the next life. We started making fun of different movies and they're actors and actresses. I started talking about how big @PERSON1's ears were and we both started cracking up with laughter uncontrollably he then came back to me with how big @ORGANIZATION1's lips were and i laughed so hard i couldn't breath. we looked through the holes in the shop to see the morning dew on the grass and birds chirping in trees and i knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. As we waited for our parents to come find us we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew by saying that it wasn't meant for all the times I tried to get us out of the shop or for @CAPS2 pulling me into the shop, no it was for the time we spent together and laughed. It made us closer than we already were and it also gave us a memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror. We have cherished that memory ever since it happened even though we @MONTH1 fight over the most tiny inconsiderate things sometimes and make fun of each other, we know that deep down we do it out of love.

58,21310,8," I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. ",40,0.6

The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook. The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of theis thing can be good if you don't post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook. I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend.

998,15758,6,"In building the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unscure departure of passengers. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions.

2348,21451,8," A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  For me laughter is a huge part of life. I cannot, nor wish to escape it. @CAPS1 is fun in itself. It always makes tense situations become relaxed and enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS1 is the best way to unite people together and form memories and bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that cause the potential, and often result, of laughter. It is the same way with my distant families such as my friends at school. Life growing up with a brother, wonderfully fun neighbors, and cousins have produced most of my @CAPS1 memories. One such time, in which laughter flowed freely, happened rather recently. The situation began when my brother, @PERSON1, had to do a school assignment. @PERSON1 was assigned, by his history teacher, to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the @DATE1's. I did not set out to help him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was thoroughly glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun. I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I came into @PERSON1's room and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas. We were making progress and once reaching a certain point, we both contributed to a subtle humorous comment we decided to add to the entry. Reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. The noise poured out of @PERSON1's room like lava from a volcano! My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but to us it was hilarious. Being in a good mood, and considering @PERSON1's history teacher said to make the entries creative, more humorous and quite witty sentences were added. By this time I was doubled over struggling to speak through all the @CAPS1 I was consumed by. @PERSON1 was hardly better. Homework had @CAPS3 been more fun. We finished quicker than if @PERSON1 was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling. @PERSON1 ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher.  This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter @CAPS4 the moment. This particular instance helped with work and yet @CAPS4 the work not a chore, but rather a tremendously happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production.

What they do ""need"" to do is to stop using computers as much and go out side! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate thought the computer. I talk to my friends all the time thought the computer"" says @PERSON1, ""@CAPS3 the easiest way"". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way but @CAPS3 also the most boring, I mean really do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person? Computers dont give you the chance to show emotion, this means people need to go out, hans out, and mabye even call each other to talk. At least you getting up to get the phone. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight. Do you really want to be a known as the ""fat country""? I dont think so. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can. To restate, I beleve that computers have a negitive affect on todays people aroung the world. Computers cause people to be less active. less emotionn in a conversation, and cause people to be obese. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active, sounds like a pretty good cause huh?",9,0.7

The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster.

The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close  knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1).

2042,4756,2,"Libraries @CAPS1 Or @CAPS2?         This world is like no other world but to have some of our ideas blocked because there to offensive thats obsurd. There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back. Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library.              There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language.           How about some of this music don't you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rapers, ect... write there lyrics they don't think of what other people think of them. They just might put the most badest languege in there songs they don't care they just want the money.Thats why you should put you're foot down and say this is going a little to far why not censor some of your lyrics? Why not write a letter sstating your concerns.           Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shoudn't even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and  start reading it. To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn't be displayed in a library.          Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there. But i really didn't think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that's something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible.           This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more. Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary. I think this is something kids don't need to see what do you think",4,0.6

1036,21321,8," My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.",40,0.6

1578,14932,6,"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.",3,0.75

A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like?

2182,17,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I belive that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives. I belive this because who spend to much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is I belive that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exersise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also belive that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privalges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boost your social skills and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addictted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer.

Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you.

You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were.

I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other.
