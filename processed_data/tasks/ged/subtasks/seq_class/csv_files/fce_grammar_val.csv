266,Introduction : The purpose of this report is to give a brief discription of the Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg .,1
267,From my point of view this building is the best option to visit .,1
268,Location : This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of Niva River with an exellent view on the Hermitage Museum .,1
269,History : The building was built by very famious Russian architect and is a marvellouse example of Russian classic architerture of XVIIIth century .,1
270,"Facilities : In the Academy of Art you can find the oldiest art libarary with a wide range of books , the Museum of Russian Art with a huge collection of painting , sculpture and architectural projects from early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries .",1
271,It is also a good chance to be introduced with Russian system of art education .,1
272,Conclusion : The building of Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting as historical as educational aspects .,1
273,"Dear Mrs Smith , I 'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you , in order to let you know all the information you have asked for .",0
274,"First of all , your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , Main-Road 21 , which is situated not far from our college .",1
275,"I 'd suggest you to walk , it will only take you about seven minutes .",1
276,"Just follow Main-Road until to reach a junction , where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road .",1
277,"The college is a huge , yellow building - you ca n't miss it .",0
278,"Secondly , you have required information about the end-of-conference party .",1
279,It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight .,0
280,All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well .,0
281,"The location of the party is n't fixed yet , but we will let you know after your arrival .",0
282,"There is no need putting on special clothes for the party , casual ones should do it as well , for we want everyone to feel comfortable .",1
283,Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon .,1
284,"I 'd suggest you to visit our local museum , as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment .",1
285,"Provided the weather is fine , you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town .",1
286,( I could book a guide for you if you 're interested ) Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need .,1

288,"Yours sincerely , The telephone , a blessing .",0
289,Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ?,0
290,Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?,1
291,"Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?",0
292,"When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .",1
293,Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .,1
294,"Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .",1
295,"Take me , for example , I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice , or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason .",0
296,"I cannot always walk to the person and say "" Sorry , I must cancel our meeting "" , because then it 's too late anyway , is n't it ?",0
297,Life definitely would n't be the same without the invention of the telephone .,0
298,We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on .,0
299,"Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all , and you will see that it is impossible to do so .",0
300,"So do n't take the telephone for granted , but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention .",0
301,"Dear Mrs Smith , I am writing with reference to your last letter concerning the international student conference in our college .",0

636,"With television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .",1
637,Television is a good way to be informed with the news .,1

858,It has been in her parents ' appartement .,1
859,The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls .,1
860,Todays nobody could imagine such a situation .,1
861,In every household there is a telephone at least .,1
862,There are a lot of advantages for it .,1
863,Firstly people are able to talk to person on every time .,1
864,Be it : just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .,1
865,"Moreover we always can call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .",1

868,Of course there is also a big disadvantage .,0
869,"All people know this situation ; people want not to be interrupted , maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little sleep ... then the telephone rings ... !",1

880,It has comfortable bedrooms and place for parties .,1
881,You can book this hotel it 's the best and it 's near to conference it 's only 15 minutes by walk .,1
882,I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .,1
883,The party it will be nice .,1
884,"The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T-shirts .",1

892,In the past the people did n't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire .,1

894,The other one is the television .,0
895,You must have TV because you can liten what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you did n't go .,1

959,"If you look around at home , there are a lot of electric things .",0
960,Electricity could be able to invent other things .,1
961,"It also gave us more free time , especially for women .",0

987,I can not imagine how our life would be .,1
988,We are living in a busy world .,1
989,"In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article e.c. ; then , time is money !",1
990,How has the phone affected my own life ?,0
991,"I think , that is a good question to think about .",1

1060,What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ?,1
1061,"You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?",0
1062,"Nowadays , everyone has a mobile phone .",0
1063,I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone .,0
1064,Five years ago you would n't have even thought about it .,0
1065,It has been a plus for me .,0
1066,"For example , now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me , and , sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with .",0
1067,"All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .",1
1068,"Chêne-Bourg , Tuesday 12th June .",0

1071,We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel .,0
1072,"Furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .",1

1076,"Best Regards , My fair Mobile Phone .",0
1077,The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .,1
1078,"The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .",1
1079,It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities .,1
1080,"Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs .",1
1081,"However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high-school student .",1
1082,"It becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ... Nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday 's courses .",1
1083,"Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student 's phone , but his parents ' !",1
1084,"Dear Madam , I received your letter and I 'm pleased to answer your questions .",1
1085,M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel .,0
1086,This is a first class hotel .,1
1087,The easiest way from the hotel to the conference is with the bus .,1

1089,Take the bus in direction center town .,1
1090,After four stops get off the bus .,1
1091,The name of this bus stop is Kongresshaus ' .,0

1093,You ca n't miss it .,0
1094,Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco .,1
1095,For the disco you mus n't wear blue jeans .,1
1096,Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town .,1
1097,It takes you two hours .,0
1098,Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .,1
1099,"If you have any more questions , write me back .",1
1100,"Yours sincerely , I will write about the invention of the computer .",1
1101,With the computer our work is easier and more interesting .,1
1102,"Before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .",1
1103,"When they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .",1
1104,"With the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again .",1
1105,We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person .,1
1106,I work at a bank and I work all day with computers .,1
1107,"If we hand't ay one , we had to write all the transactions on papers .",1
1108,If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after .,1
1109,"But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days after .",1
1110,"I have never work without a computer , but if we had n't any we would it find normally .",1
1111,"Dear Mrs M. Smith , I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested .",0
1112,"First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .",1
1113,"In fact you can take the bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right hand .",1
1114,"Secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge .",1
1115,I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .,1
1116,"What is more , I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie .",1
1117,"Finally , if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours .",1
1118,"However , if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square .",1
1119,I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you .,0
1120,"Yours Sincerely , Have you ever thought to live without your car ?",1
1121,How can you manage your daily life without it ?,0
1122,I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car .,1
1123,It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .,1
1124,"On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy .",1
1125,In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring lugguage and shopping bags .,1
1126,Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey .,1
1127,"For example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with .",1
1128,"However , I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic .",1
1129,On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly .,1
1130,That 's why I could n't image my life without it .,1
1131,"Dear Maria First at all , I am sorry about Richard illness .",1
1132,Please remember me to him and give him my best wishes .,0
1133,"About your request , I 'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need , however you can call me if you consider it necessary , ( my phone number is 2496 9731 ) .",1
1134,Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .,0
1135,Because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it .,1
1136,"Moreover , it is really well-located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem .",1
1137,"Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre , which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel .",1
1138,"We have n't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well-dressed , if you feel better .",1
1139,After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each others .,1
1140,"Finally in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery .",1
1141,It will take you two or three hours but it 's a gorgeous place .,0
1142,I look forward hearing from you .,1
1143,"Yours sincerely , "" Sagrada Familia "" a real holly building .",1
1144,"If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona , which you can like whatever your tastes are , you should visit the "" Sagrada Familia "" .",1
1145,"Among the big number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art .",1
1146,"Gaudi conceived this church n 1912 , though it was n't until 1920 they started to build it .",1
1147,Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again .,1
1148,After Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later .,1
1149,"Nowadays , a hard work is being done in order to finish as soon as possible .",1
1150,The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit .,1
1151,There is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted .,1
1152,"And , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .",1
1153,"There you can enjoy a terrific view , not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building .",1
1154,"Dear Mrs Maria Smith , I am writing to give you some information asked in your letter , which I received this morning .",1
1155,Your group has been booked in Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London .,1
1156,"Personally , I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities .",0
1157,It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference .,1
1158,In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .,1
1159,"However you would take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .",1
1160,"Regarding to the end-of-conference party , I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .",1

1162,"Basicaly , during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of interesting places of London .",1
1163,However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos .,1
1164,I look forward to welcoming you .,0
1165,Yours sincerely Are you always happy when your telephon ring ?,1
1166,As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in 19th century .,1
1167,"It has been affecting our lifes very quickly , although there were some different ways of communication as TV , for instance .",1
1168,"Since the internet was introduced , many of us would n't have imagined the lifes without this .",1
1169,We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time .,1
1170,"However , are you always happy when your personal phone rings .",1
1171,On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you would n't have your mobile switched on .,1
1172,This invention has affected my life completely .,1
1173,Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without internet or my mobile phone .,1
1174,"In spite of having the opportunity of keeping contact with friends at the time we are far away from home , we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others .",1
1175,"Dear Mrs Maria Smith , I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference .",1

1181,I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .,1
1182,Your sincerely There are many different people 's inventions around us .,1
1183,"We are so used to them , that sometimes think they existed always .",1
1184,"Some of them are very practical , other are rather strange .",1
1185,"I thing , that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone .",1
1186,Imagine life without phone .,1
1187,"You are on the road , you have car accident .",1
1188,What are you going to do without phone ?,1
1189,"On another situation , your son is ill , he needs help urgently .",1
1190,"I am sure , the phone has saved many lifes .",1
1191,"Besides , it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum , only for chating in any time .",1
1192,"Thanks the phone , it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth .",1
1193,"To be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n't work , if you have n't got the phone .",1
1194,"So I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name .",1
1195,"It always happens with people , does n't ?",1
1196,Try to ask who invented the will or the book .,1
1197,"Dear Mrs. Smith , I am writing in reply to your letter .",0
1198,I am sorry about Richard Brown .,0
1199,"And I understand that you need help , so that I will help you as far as I can .",1
1200,"Firstly , the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference .",1

1204,You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well .,0
1205,"Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience in here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals .",1
1206,"As you may hear , our city is well known for the musicals .",1
1207,"Or , If you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel .",1
1208,"Whatever you choose , you will be satisfied with your choice .",0
1209,"If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me .",1
1210,I would be glad to be able to help you .,0
1211,"Yours sincerely , Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined .",1
1212,"People do not have the impression on important inventions any more , because they have been getting more popular and common .",1
1213,"However , there is something which is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention .",1
1214,This is electricity invented by Edison .,1
1215,"From my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour .",1
1216,"What is more , many inventions have been accelerated by electricity .",0
1217,"In my life , I use electricity in many different ways .",0
1218,"At night , I can study because of it. and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing .",1
1219,It makes my life more convenient than that without it .,1
1220,"To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .",0
1221,"Dear Mrs Maria Smith , I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill I hope it wo n't be grave .",1
1222,"However , I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful .",0
1223,"the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is Palace Hotel , to get there you must go to the centre of town , all buses are going there , Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office .",1
1224,For the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us life music and cattering .,1
1225,Due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes .,1
1226,"Finally , to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk arround the old part of the city , if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings .",1
1227,"Yours sincerely , Chairs are not only part of the forniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols .",1
1228,Who could have invented such a useful item ?,0
1229,"In fact , nobody has got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !",1
1230,"the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs , from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices .",1
1231,From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented .,1
1232,"Some people use them in their work , others are wishing to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement .",1
1233,Although is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .,1
1234,"Dear Mrs Maria Smith , I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon .",0
1235,I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information .,1
1236,Your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college .,1
1237,"The college will arrange a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15 .",1
1238,The reason we do n't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you 'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .,1
1239,"As you already know we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining , then it will a buffet and a disco .",1
1240,"You do n't need to dress up smartly but please , make sure that your students do n't wear short or trainers .",1
1241,Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim .,1

1246,"Best regards , To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car .",1
1247,Cars take a big part in our life .,1
1248,Everywhere you look you can see cars .,0
1249,"More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport .",1
1250,Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport .,0
1251,"You do n't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .",1
1252,Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill .,1
1253,"Could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot ?",0
1254,I do n't think I need to comment on this .,0
1255,From my personal experience I realised how it 's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa .,0
1256,I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I could n't drive at that time .,0
1257,Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live .,0
1258,"I could n't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous .",0
1259,"There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else .",1
1260,There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .,1
1261,Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before .,1
1262,I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it !,1

1525,.,0
1526,There is also a Portrait Gallery in the left wing of the Palace .,0
1527,.,0
1528,"The Old Town is the best place for afternoon stroll with a great deal of restaurants , caffes and street performers .",1

1531,POSITIVE POINTS .,0

1534,Most of the admissions are absolutely free .,1
1535,NEGATIVE POINTS .,0
1536,"A part of the Palace might be closed , due to the constant renovations .",1
1537,.,0
1538,All the facilities are usually overcrowded during a summer holiday .,1
1539,"CONCLUSION : Despite the few drawbacks , I would strongly recommend the Royal Palace as the most suitable place to visit for the foreign students .",0
1540,"Mrs Maria Smith , I 'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .",1
1541,"The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel , which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc .",1
1542,"To get from the hotel to the conference , you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne , and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet , Divonne .",1
1543,"When you come out , just go on your right , and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school .",1
1544,The end-of-conference party will take place at the same place .,0
1545,"Some musicians will play classical music , and there will be many different drinks and food .",0
1546,"you should wear some formal clothes , but not necessary really pretty clothes For three hours , you could visit the museum of the Red Cross , which is very interesting .",1
1547,"I hope that these informations will help you Sincerely yours , The portable phone , a very useful invention !",1
1548,"During all mankind history , there were discovers who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made .",1
1549,"When the phone without cable was invented , one was n't sure if it would be a success or not .",1
1550,"But the research went on , and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful .",1
1551,"The portable phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .",1
1552,"Moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one has n't enough money to buy it .",1
1553,"Personally , the portable phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is phoning at home , I do n't have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it 's too late .",1
1554,I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do n't have a portable phone .,1
1555,"Dear Mrs Smith , I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here .",1
1556,"The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed .",1
1557,The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 ( the bus stop is opposite to the hotel ) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it .,1
1558,There is a party on the last day of the conference .,0
1559,Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best .,0
1560,"Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music , dancing and fun are provided .",1
1561,Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11pm .,1
1562,You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party .,0
1563,Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party .,1
1564,"Yours sincerely , Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life ?",0
1565,"Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone , a car , a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day .",1
1566,Hundred years before people could n't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer .,1
1567,"They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one beleives it is really so .",1
1568,Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .,1
1569,"First of all they say about enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .",1
1570,But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then .,1
1571,I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people 's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone does n't matter wherever you are ( I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) .,1
1572,Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems .,0
1573,An electric lamp was an important invention hundred years before ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) .,1
1574,I think it would n't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life .,1
1575,"Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undenyable neccecerity in our life .",1
1576,In case of all said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel 's inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages .,1
1577,"Dear Mrs Smith , I am writing to you to give you more informations about an international student conference .",1
1578,The group has been booked into King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find .,1
1579,"And the best way to get from there to the conference is following the rod in front of the hotel to the right , then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side .",1
1580,After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called White House .,1
1581,"At the end of conference , we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college .",1
1582,As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country .,1
1583,"Finally , on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping at High Street .",1
1584,"If you want more information , please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon .",0
1585,"Yours sincerely , Dear Mr. Bill , I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit .",1
1586,"It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .",1
1587,"On the positive side , you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furnitures .",1
1588,The building itself looks splendid and beautiful .,0
1589,"On the other hand , you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old wooden floor which causes some noise .",1
1590,And some old toilets might look awlful .,1
1591,"But in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .",1
1592,Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country .,1
1593,"As Wales is not modern like America , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .",1
1594,"Yours sincerely , Dear Mrs Maria .",1
1595,"I am one of all students and I am going to give you an information , all you need .",1
1596,"We have been booked the hotel for you and the name of hotel is "" Palace Hotel "" quite near shopping centre .",1

1599,About the end-of-conference party .,1
1600,"We are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to bring you to the Hotel , you need to wear a night-dress or suit and bow tie .",1
1601,"Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggestion , you can go to shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to museam because this museam is the biggest in the world now It is up to you .",1

1632,"When booking a airline , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get it done in one minute .",1
1633,"Secondly , instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need , we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network .",1
1634,"It 's a very often heard , that someone , who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institutes , which he find via internet .",1
1635,"Moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , controling operations or having conferences .",1
1636,Lastly the way of communications has been also changed .,1
1637,"Instead of the tranditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of computer network .",1
1638,Of course there 're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved .,1
1639,"For example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on papers .",1
1640,A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security .,1

1642,"In conclusion , computer have become a very essential necessity of our life , and it 's still a young invention , which need to be improved .",1

2207,"Yours sincerely , Can you imagine your life without any computers at all ?",0
2208,"Well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert !",1
2209,"If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives .",1
2210,"For example , all infrastructures such as transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals .",1

2234,Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world .,1
2235,On the other hand there are some disadvantages .,0
2236,"For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .",1
2237,"Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .",1
