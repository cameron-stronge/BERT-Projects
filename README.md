# CAMemBERT

I know its a cheesey name

This is a repository for my masters individual project. The goal of the project is to use a pre-trained model (such as BERT) to build a language model in the language learner domain (e.g a native spanish speaker learning english). The language model will be assessed on a number of down-stream tasks.
