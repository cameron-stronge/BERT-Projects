45,"Unfortunately , we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre .",0
46,"Firstly , we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show .",1
47,"We thought , as usual we do in London theatre , we could have discounts as it 's written on your advertisement .",1
48,"Surprisily , there were no discounds .",1
49,"Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , it 's a theatre but not a concert hall !",1
50,!,0
51,!,0
52,!,0
53,"Thirdly , we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical .",1
54,Why did you not change the name of your advertisement ?,1
55,"In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staffs , this evening !",1
56,!,0
57,Nothing was serious .,1
58,"We really like London , the people , the night-life but this evening was really awful .",0
59,I sent to you a copie of our tickets .,1
60,Would you pleased return our money back .,1
61,"In advance , thank you .",0
62,"I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre .",1
63,"Sincerely yours Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .",0
64,"When her best friend , Scala , asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she 's pregnant , Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala 's husband got the surprise .",1
65,The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village .,1
66,She 's a secretary in an office .,0
67,Everybody knows everybody .,0
68,"Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husband too .",1
69,"It was a Friday suny afternoon , Scala was really excited to tell her the new .",1
70,Despite she knew that Pat could n't keep secret but for this time she was confident maybe too .,1
71,"Just after Scala told her the new , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell that Scala is pregnant .",1
72,"As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & bought the bread for the evening .",0
73,"Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said "" Congratulations for the new baby .",1
74,""" He was so amazed and asked to repeat .",1
75,"She just thought it would be a secret , she came really embarassed .",1
76,"When he went back to his house , his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it was n't a surprise !",0
77,Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret .,1
78,"Sir manager , I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper .",1
79,"I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had , I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there , but when you said that show was the best I decided to go .",1
80,When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available .,1
81,At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said .,1
82,"I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality , but that was not all .",1
83,When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor .,1
84,Really he was bad .,0
85,Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .,0
86,So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .,0
87,I am letting down because of your behaviour .,1
88,"You wanted to cheat me , so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back .",1
89,I am looking forward your answer .,1
90,"Your faithfully , I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world .",1
91,First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .,1
92,"Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - are making different things .",1
93,"For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone .",1
94,I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes .,1
95,A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven .,1
96,In my case I dislike computers .,1
97,I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier .,1
98,On the other hand what will happen with us in the future ?,1
99,Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs .,1
100,"So , what are we going to do ?",0
101,"Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .",1
102,"Dear Mr. Ryan , I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two weeks travel to Camp California .",1

105,I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel .,1
106,"About accommodation , I think tents would be great .",1
107,Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children .,0
108,Basketball will help children to build team character and leadership .,1
109,And swimming is very good for health .,1
110,I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player .,1
111,I count on my experience .,1
112,And there are few questions I would like to ask .,1
113,"First , what clothes should I take with me , secondly. how much money and by cash or by travel cards .",1

137,"After your show I wanted to visit my friends , and because of it , I did n't do it .",1
138,"Also , you wrote about discounts , but it 's not true !",1
139,"The woman , who sold a ticket was very roud with me , actually she started swearing at me .",1
140,"During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit restaurant , it 's a pity , but restaurant was closed because it was too late .",1

180,"Dear Clark , I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the ' international arts festival .",0
181,' First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .,1
182,"However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .",0
183,"To begin with , you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved .",1
184,My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .,0
185,Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .,1
186,This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining .,1
187,Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year .,1
188,Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price .,1
189,To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year .,1
190,In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments .,1
191,Yours sincerely How can you earn money in your spare time ?,0
192,I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it .,0
193,Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work .,1
194,"A traditional way to earn money , in the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .",1
195,The problems that you have here is the weather .,1
196,"For example when it is rainy , because then everything get wet .",1
197,"Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls , for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .",1
198,"But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .",1
199,Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at you 'll also earn some money .,1
200,"Okay do n't wait , there where you 're good at and begin .",1
201,Dear Sir/madam I am writing with regard to your advertisment .,1
202,During my 2 week 's holiday I would like to attend a musical show .,1
203,It was my favorite play .,1
204,I was very hopefull that I was going to have a good time .,1
205,But there were many things which went wrong .,1
206,"Firstly , I have had no discount at paying. secondly there was delay which got me into trouble , After the show I could n't catch my train .",1
207,Because I did n't have any plan I decided to have a lunch in theatre restaurant .,1
208,But it was closed .,0
209,The worst thing is that I could n't watch my favorite actor .,1
210,I was so dissapointted with that .,1
211,I could n't consentrate on the play any more .,1
212,Contrary to the advertisment everything was disapointing .,1
213,I regret to demand all my expenses .,1
214,I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible situation .,1
215,I am waiting for a satisfactory answer Yours faithfully Azami Technology has developed increasingly in recent years .,1
216,As a result of this our society has changed a lot .,0
217,On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier .,0
218,"On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .",0
219,Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before .,1
220,Although in those days the only way of learning was reading .,0
221,"These days we can use computer , television and some sophisticated equipment. which were unusuall before .",1
222,Than to technology we can reach any place in the world easily .,1
223,We can get some information more quickly .,1
224,Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well .,1
225,Children play wit computer instead of usuall plays .,1
226,Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively .,1
227,There has been change relatinships between people .,1
228,People are getting more and more lonely .,0
229,We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years .,1
230,"While we are using technology , we should take into consideration environment .",1
231,We should n't allow to be exploited the world .,1
232,"If we want to leave a good world to the next generations , we should behave more respectfully againgst the nature .",1
233,"Dear Mr. Clark , I 'm a italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival .",1
234,"I think this festival is a great idea because it 's a possibility to see and to love the art , but , I think also there are some things thas could be changed .",1
235,I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world .,1
236,This choice does n't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself .,1
237,Some concert halls were too small and often people could n't see the performances .,0
238,There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films .,1
239,Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people .,1
240,"The very about young people , the choice to offer a reasonably-priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .",1
241,I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people .,1
242,Thank you and greetings .,1
243,I think a good way to get money it 's work in a fast-food .,1
244,"Maybe the first impression is n't positive but from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money .",1
245,For six months I 've worked in a McDonald 's restaurant in Italy and I 've got lots of money .,0
246,"I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food you can work part-time , four , three , six hours every day .",1
247,It depends on what you need .,0
248,This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study .,1
249,"If you work in a fast-food you can work in the afternoon , or during the night and so you have time for yourself .",1
250,In the staff you can also find young people and getting fun with them during the work .,1
251,What do you want more ?,1
252,If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that .,0

361,"I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can studie the reaction before , during and after to shopping .",1
362,People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion .,1
363,Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary .,1
364,We must to accept that media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V .,1
365,"For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes , cosmetic , accesories , jewels etc. And the other they choose sometimes just for the label .",1
366,"Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area , because people in general they do n't spent the time for prepare food and when they shopping they choose pre-prepared food .",1
367,We know is more easy for these busy life .,1
368,In the other hand the facilities for access to mall center is not good .,1
369,"The area for parking , space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate .",1
370,Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable .,1
371,"I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment. which is special place in the town we lefet just for comerical area , but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket , and mall centre in different areas of the city .",1

376,"BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I WAS DISAPPOINTED .",1

380,"BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .",1

396,"Dear Sir or Madam , I am writing to complain about the musical show "" Over the Rainbow "" , that I went to see on the 16th of June .",1
397,"Firstly , the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagen , I was very disappointed .",1
398,"Another complain is about the time that the musical show started , the advertisement said it started at 19:30 , but it did not , we had to wait 45 minutes .",1
399,It was terrible .,0
400,"Now , about the tickets , the were different prices but there were not discounts , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .",1
401,"Finally , when the musical show finished , and I have to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .",1
402,At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .,1
403,Looking forward to hearing from you .,0
404,"Yours faithfully , Pat , Maria 's best friend Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost kill but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .",1
405,"Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did , but Pat refused to apologaising to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : help Maria to get the man that she loved .",1
406,"Maria was speechless , it was the first time that she did n't know what to do , so she decided to stop talking to Pat .",0
407,"After 3 weeks , Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school .",1
408,"Some friends phoned her everyday , except Pat , the only friend that Maria really loved , despite that , she was not sad .",1
409,"One day , when Maria was seating in her bedroom , someone knock the door , it was Manuel , he was worried for her .",1
410,"Maria was nervous , but for the first time , she could talk to him as she never did before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person of the world , she gave her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back , after all , everything happened because of her .",1
411,"Wawsaw , 12th December 2000 Dear Mr Robertson , First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting program .",1
412,"We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we were always interested in .",1
413,"However , there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .",1
414,"For example , in the time of our visit there is going to be "" The London Fashion and Leisure Show "" .",1
415,It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage on .,1
416,This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from .,1
417,We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems .,0
418,Our suggestion is to visit Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .,1
419,Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long .,1
420,We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time .,1
421,The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day .,0
422,We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request .,0
423,Yours faithfully Famous people are living creatures .,1
424,"They breathe , eat , feel and beside that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .",1
425,Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy .,1
426,"I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps .",1
427,Like in the zoo .,1
428,"The biggest commercial gain in history I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .",1
429,"On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .",0
430,"It may in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it .",1
431,"To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life .",1
432,"Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get use to this living "" under a microscope "" .",1
433,"Dear Jane Clark , The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend .",1
434,"I believe that the event was good , however I feel that the festival can be improved next year .",1
435,"Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .",1
436,"I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet other personalities .",1
437,"Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy concerts because some concert halls were too small .",1
438,I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .,1
439,Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly .,1
440,I hope you find my opinion useful .,1
441,Once again congratulations on the Festival .,1
442,"I hope to hearing from you soon yours sincerelly , tips to earn money When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us .",1
443,there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .,1
444,"One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills , all you need is a lot of patience .",1
445,"If looking after children does n't fit you , you can try with pets .",1
446,Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk .,0
447,So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time .,1
448,Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car .,0
449,"In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .",0
450,"the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .",1
451,"If you do n't find anything good enough for you do n't worry , you should always remember : It 's not all about the money !",0
452,"To Mr Robertson , Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .",1
453,"It was very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .",1
454,"However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend .",1
455,It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March .,0
456,It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm .,0
457,"The show will be about all the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .",1
458,We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students .,0
459,This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them .,1
460,The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go .,1
461,I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .,1
462,We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .,0
463,We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .,0
464,We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .,1
465,"Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .",0
466,I hope you would consider this matter .,1
467,I look forward to hearing from you .,0
468,"Yours sincerely , Everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a plier , even homes are effected .",1
469,"From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ?",1
470,"No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .",1
471,I see a very different home for us in the future .,0
472,Most things will be computerised .,0
473,We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys .,0
474,We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers .,1
475,We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room .,1
476,Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .,0
477,Although all that may change our houses may be still the same .,1
478,The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .,1
479,We might still favour that old carpet and couch .,1
480,The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too .,1
481,"In the future , every child might have a laptop .",0
482,"And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ?",0
483,We will be learning at home using computers and disc .,1
484,Never have to leave the house or wake up so early .,1
485,Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using .,1
486,"We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .",1
487,"Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .",1
488,This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .,1
489,"Lastly , I think that all this changes wo n't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead abruptedly .",1
490,People will be able to adjust and change with the times .,0
491,"Dear Mr Robertson , On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show , that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed .",1
492,In addition we would like to thank you about the programme .,1
493,"Firstly , I would like to give you some details about this show .",0
494,"It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00 I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping , so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !",1
495,The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .,1
496,"Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what does it include .",1
497,The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear .,1
498,Really interesting !,0
499,Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles .,1
500,I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London .,1
501,"But , if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same hour with shopping , I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do !",1
502,"I look forward to your reply , Yours sincerely , Some people think that to be a famous person is very excuiting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .",1
503,"I believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results .",1
504,"For example , the politicians the have choosed their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .",1
505,"Another succesfull carreer such as , film stars must also be balanced .",1
506,"If somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .",1
507,If somebody wants to be famous of cource must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .,1
508,But I think that the are limits .,1
509,Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .,1
510,It does n't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow .,1
511,You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself .,1
512,And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .,1
513,"Dear Mr Robertson , Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you the great opportunity you give us , especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way .",1
514,"I think that this programme has a good organisation , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .",1
515,"But , I was wondering , like a student of this college , if we would change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .",1
516,It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock .,0
517,"In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the , we can go to the show .",1
518,"Front my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear , make up , hairstyles , you know ... I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and best city to appreciate it .",1
519,Please let me know if you are agree with us !,1
520,Oh I forgot about it !,1
521,"Besides , this show is gree ( another positiu point ) .",1
522,Looking forward to hearing from you .,0
523,Yours sincerely FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ?,0
524,Do you think you 've the future in your hands ?,1
525,Do you think we 're living like old times ?,1
526,Would you like living in a modern way ?,1
527,What do you expect about the future ?,1
528,Can you compare it ... ?,0
529,Are you afraid ?,0
530,"Well , you can look at your house ... Nowadays , we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes , to cook to be more comfortable , for example the TV , the video recorder , etc .",1
531,"Maybe , in a few years later we 'll have a bigger TV , a more suitable radio but , from my point of view , I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes .",1
532,"We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer 's games for example ... But not in the strange way you can imagine ... I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars by aereoplanes ... In this way , you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing in the same way you'r changing , too .",1
533,"In conclusion , I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening our lifes .",1
534,"So , we have the future in our hands !",0
535,Think about it .,0
536,"Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for good programme which provides us 3 days stay in London .",1
537,"It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping .",1
538,It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .,0
539,"However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .",0
540,"The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc. Moreover , students are allowed to admit for free .",1
541,"All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up , so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like .",1
542,It would be grateful if you give a little change in programme so that we are able to attend the show .,1
543,"It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .",1
544,I am looking forward to hearing from you .,0
545,Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .,1
546,"To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .",0
547,"50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food .",1
548,"Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their life have been far easier than before .",1
549,"Today , however , people do not need to spend many times on making food , washing up , or even on turning on an off the light .",1
550,"Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary .",1
551,"From my point of view , people 's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connecting to the owner .",1
552,"He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .",0
553,"On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a "" family "" .",0
554,"In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .",0
555,"Computer might know better than human , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .",1
556,"Dear Ms Ryan , I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter .",1
557,I will give you all the necessary information .,0
558,"I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work , my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .",1
559,"I would prefer to stay in tents rather than in log cabins , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .",1
560,"As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming .",1
561,I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me .,1
562,Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money .,0
563,"I want to thank you for this prize , let me know if you need further information .",1
564,I look forward to hearing from you .,0
565,"Yours sincerely , Bianca Botticelli Dear Kim , In your last letter you asked me about the concert ... oh it was fantastic !",0
566,I 've always loved music so working in a concert was great .,1
567,"You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert , apart from the musicists and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security service ... it was so exciting !",1
568,"My work consisted in checking the tickets , the number on them and taking the people to their seats .",1
569,"It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they did n't want to wait for my help ; so they went around the theatre , looking for their seats and making so much noise .",0
570,"Sometimes I think that people never grow up , if they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise !",1
571,!,0
572,"Anyway , it was a great experience in spite of these little problems .",0

582,Why people like so much go shopping ?,1
583,"In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .",1
584,"Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .",1
585,"In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .",1
586,"To sum up , all you make in small cuantities is good and funny , but do n't encrease them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .",1

784,On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem .,1
785,In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day .,0
786,"Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody could find you .",1
787,I think that the most important modern technology in these days is internet .,1
788,"With internet you can do whatever you want without going out home ( shoping , speaking with a friend , working , putting your money aside .... ) On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies .",1

839,I did n't have a computer until I was eight .,0
840,Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .,0
841,In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games .,1
842,When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer .,0
843,It became scencial to do my homework .,1

845,One day my mother got a terrible disease .,0
846,She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared .,0
847,But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one .,1

880,"Sometimes , they are happy to do shopping. but why ?",1
881,"Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case .",1
882,Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone .,1
883,In fact you try to get a present to make receive happy .,1
884,"Shopping is also good , when you know what you want .",1
885,For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .,1
886,"In the opposite , shopping can be disenjoyable .",1
887,Shopping is boring if you go with people too fussy .,1
888,"That is to say , they are never happy with what they get and see .",1
889,They always find a problem .,0
890,Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops .,0
891,"It is stupid , they do not have any goal .",1
892,They waste their time .,0
893,"To conclude , I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable .",1
894,Even if I like to do shopping with some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time .,1
895,To the manager of the Circle Theatre in London I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London a few time ago .,1

898,"The star , the actor Danny Brook , there was n't in the musical show but there was an other actor , with my great disappoint .",1

905,"That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided the program and the present , a new gold watch .",1

911,""" In the night Francis was invited to the party , at Pat 's home .",0
912,"When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , a his friend , ask him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .",1
913,The Francis 's secret was discovered !,1
914,Now all the Pat 's friend do n't tell her about their secrets because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .,1
915,"Dear Sir , I went to your show called "" Over The Rainbow "" and I was really disappointing in many points .",1
916,"Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .",1

918,In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late .,0
919,It was boring for everybody .,0
920,How could we appreciate the show properly .,0
921,"Moreover , in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case .",1
922,No discounts were available .,0
923,Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people .,1
924,You offered something impossible to do .,1
925,I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give my money back .,1

931,She could n't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with .,0
932,She did n't tell me yet but when I came in class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .,1
933,I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class .,1
934,I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground .,1
935,I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me .,0
936,I could n't go back to the class so I went home .,0
937,My Mum was at home and I told her all the story .,1
938,She said that I had to be strong and did n't care about them .,1
939,So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stopped because he loved me and wanted to be with me .,1
940,At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh .,1

948,So could you give us permission to go ?,0

953,"faithful 12-12-00 It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .",1
954,Because there was a man had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him .,1
955,Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes .,0
956,I was thinking ' what should I do ?,0
957,' I have n't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home .,1
958,"At that time he was unconcious , I kept asking myself should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him .",1
959,"I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .",1
960,"I decided to do something to this man , my first move was to check was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe .",1
961,And checking his body condition .,1
962,After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars .,1
963,I ran back home for help .,0
964,I phoned to police And told the whole story .,1
965,"The strange thing happened to me , when I got back to that man .",1
966,The car and the man were not there anymore .,0
967,Where could they be ?,0
968,I was wondering .,0

970,Dear Madam : I just receive your letter with the good news .,1
971,I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June .,1
972,For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .,1
973,I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .,0
974,I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .,1
975,Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget .,1
976,Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .,0
977,Yours faithfully Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food .,1
978,On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family .,1
979,I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate does n't matter how much money does it cost .,1
980,"In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested to please .",1

1077,We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem .,1

1079,I 'm allowed to do many things at home .,0
1080,"My parents are very kind , and they know that their son will do everything right .",0
1081,"And the main reason Why our family is so friendly , it 's because we have n't go many rules .",1

1257,"The great idea of making it "" international "" was unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be "" from around the world "" ) were from only six countries .",1
1258,Maybe the eason for that is very simple : lack of money ?,1
1259,"It would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .",1
1260,"On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most .",1

1488,"I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .",1

1492,The aim of this report is make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed .,1
1493,"It 's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory Furthermore , I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped .",1
1494,"In addition , I think you have to take also plans from the school 's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good .",1
1495,I think also that will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background .,1
1496,"In conclusion , I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help to this short video by all means .",1
1497,"Dear Sir or Madam , I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all paid in advance .",1

1499,"I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to the problems beyond my control .",1
1500,Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad .,0
1501,I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them .,1
1502,It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp .,0
1503,As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them .,1
1504,I came second last year 's swimming competition and I have enrolled photography classes .,1
1505,In the camp I can practise them alot .,1
1506,I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency .,0
1507,Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter .,1
1508,"Yours faithfully Dear Kim , I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another .",0
1509,But I finally got around writing and you 'll see that it 's definetly worth waiting as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you .,1
1510,"As you know I 'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A-level history , such as meeting up my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .",1
1511,However this term has been a far cry from the others .,1
1512,You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter .,1
1513,Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .,1
1514,She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite .,1
1515,Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope .,1
1516,"It was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion .",0
1517,I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .,0
1518,Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my life write me soon .,1
1519,"Yours sincerely , Dear Mr. Robertson , The trip that you planned for us , students , it 's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London .",1
1520,Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events .,1
1521,We 'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated with our school and the students that study there .,1
1522,It 's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions .,1
1523,But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .,0
1524,The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .,1
1525,"It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to make up .",1
1526,Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon .,1
1527,"By this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion .",1
1528,Thanks for the attention and we 're waiting for your answer .,1
1529,"Yours faithfully , Famous People x Media Famous people are special for the rest of the society .",1
1530,They form opinions and invent new fashion styles .,0
1531,"Nowadays , the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information .",1
1532,The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people .,1
1533,It 's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life .,1
1534,If the famous person does n't mind in being filmed in his personal life there 's no problem .,1
1535,But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect .,1
1536,Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .,1
1537,"In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems .",1
1538,The respect is essential .,1
1539,They deserve to have a private life like any common person .,1
1540,"Dear Mr/Mss I 'm writing you in complain about musical show , that I have visited last evening .",1
1541,"I had a week holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was the worse evening in my life .",1

1543,"Second , the show started at 20:15 , althoug I read that it started at 19:30 !",1
1544,"More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .",1
1545,"It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , so it is still my dream because of your show .",0
1546,"So , I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back .",0
1547,"I hope you 'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show , you should return my money .",0
1548,Yours faithfuly How has modern techology changed my daily life .,1
1549,Fifty years ago people even did n't think that after 2000 years they would have another life .,1
1550,"When Thomas Adison invented an electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that centure .",1
1551,And nowadays modern technology can change all our life .,1
1552,"I mean , almost everyone has now a car , a computer , a mobil phone and even an airplane .",1
1553,My life is changing too .,0
1554,"First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet .",1
1555,Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen .,1
1556,Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave .,1
1557,What is more Modern technology prevents different illnesses .,1
1558,"Further more , yesterday I 've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view in 2050 year everybody will fly to the space .",1
1559,On the other hand people can atrophided of all this inventions .,1
1560,He become lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton .,1
1561,"In conclusion I want to say that inspite of this , I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems .",1
1562,Dear Mr Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London .,1

1565,"It is called ,,The London Fashion and Leisure Show .",1
1566,"This would be a great opportunity because we are all intrested in clothes , sports and fashion .",1
1567,I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students !,1
1568,Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum .,1
1569,"The show lasts nine hours , from 10.00-19.00 , the whole day !",0
1570,Our question now : Could we go to this show ?,1

1588,"Unfortunately it is quite expensive , £ 32 .",0

1595,Then I 'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California .,0
1596,I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .,1

1604,"In fact , there is nothing very important I did , because we are not the right people to do it .",1
1605,"I only put the speakers in the right places , or helping engieners tested the lights .",1
1606,"But at the brakes and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engieners , and I leant something about setting up the equitment .",1

1617,"According to your advertisement , the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .",1
1618,"I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings , but at the day I saw it , a different actor played .",1
1619,He was not DANNY BROOK .,0
1620,Moreover there was no discount ticket .,1
1621,They were all sold out .,0
1622,You should have said they were very few .,1
1623,I had to buy a £ 20 ticket .,0
1624,"To make matters worse , the time that the show started was delayed .",1
1625,"It started at 20:15 , fourty five minutes later !",1
1626,That 's why I could n't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .,1
1627,"It had already closed , when the show finished .",1
1628,I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night .,0
1629,Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .,1

1634,"When I find a new message , I 'm very happy .",0
1635,"Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometime telephon .",1

1644,I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected .,0
1645,"First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .",0
1646,"However , he was not on the stage that day .",0
1647,Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .,1
1648,It was a waste of time .,0
1649,"I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and I had to pay for normal price .",1
1650,"Furthur more , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .",1
1651,"I had to go home without eating a dinner , though I was really hungry .",1

1658,"People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .",0
1659,"But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?",0
1660,I think it 'll also be very different from now .,0
1661,But in which way ?,1
1662,"First of all , people might think more about the function of clothes than the design .",0
1663,"For example , they 'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution , sunshine etc .",1
1664,"Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designers brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .",1
1665,"It 's like a joke , but a bit scarely .",1
1666,"Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from sun-burn , and it 's the most trendy fashion of the year !",1
1667,It 's funny .,0
1668,But we never know !,0
1669,!,0
1670,"Dear Sir/Madam , I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show ' Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .",1
1671,It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement .,1
1672,"However , there was a different unknown actor in that .",1
1673,The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in ' 19.30 ' as shown .,1
1674,There was no discount at all which is in contrast with ' Discounts Availabe ' .,1
1675,"After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .",1
1676,The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement .,1
1677,I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .,0

1679,Thank you for your attention .,0
1680,"Yours faithfully , What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?",0
1681,It is a very hard thing to predict .,0
1682,The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing .,1
1683,Although some may appears again after few years different styles are developed .,1
1684,"For the fashion of the future , I think it depends on the people 's own personalities and develope their own styles which suits them the most .",1
1685,"They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries .",1
1686,"For the colours , I think the metalic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .",1
1687,As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .,1
1688,Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday .,1
1689,They can be thrown away after wearing it and light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change your wearing .,1
1690,Dear Mrs. Ryan .,1
1691,I 'm glad to receive your letter .,0

1695,I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents to France .,1
1696,This has been scheduled 3 months ago .,1
1697,"About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents .",1
1698,"While I 'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .",1
1699,There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp .,0

1701,I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me .,0
1702,I look forward to hearing from you .,0
1703,"Yours sincerely From my point of view , the real question is : Who said that is enjoyable ?",0
1704,"Maybe for women , but not for me .",0
1705,"I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happens .",0
1706,"For men , sometimes is hard to go shopping with their partners .",1
1707,Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .,0
1708,"And of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like .",1
1709,The Sports Shop .,1
1710,You cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .,1
1711,And that is allways what we want .,1
1712,That 's men 's intention .,0
1713,Another point is to go a big area .,1
1714,Specially week-ends .,1
1715,Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .,0
1716,People should have to take a license to drive those things .,1
1717,Someone could be injured .,0
1718,"And of course , the time to pay .",0
1719,A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .,1
1720,"In conclusion , for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .",1
1721,"Dear Sir , I 'm writing to you inform you about the dissapointing evening I had when I went to your theather to see the play called "" OVER THE RAINBOW "" .",1
1722,"According to the advertisement you gave , there have been some important differents .",1
1723,"Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actor on stage .",0
1724,"Secondly , in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount .",1
1725,"Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays .",1
1726,"In addition to this , I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there .",1
1727,I would be grateful if you do it .,1
1728,"Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers .",1
1729,"If you do it , there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them .",1
1730,"I look fordwad to hearing from you Your sincerely , How has modern technology change my daily life ?",1
1731,"Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .",0
1732,It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it .,1
1733,In this case we are going to focus on me .,1
1734,"Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have choosen is Internacional Commerce or Market .",1
1735,I use technology every moment but I did not realise .,1
1736,"For example , when I come back home from university and I call my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and fax and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that .",1
1737,"We also have five computer , the latest versions of them , because they are useful for my father to work and for me to do some special works for University .",1
1738,"This machines are connected to Internet , and it gives to my family too much facility to get every information we want , from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday 's football match .",1
1739,In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in U.S.A. It 's really amazing .,1
1740,"Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time in technology .",1
1741,"I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all life , but it is only a little part of it .",1
1742,Dear Sir/Madam : I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show .,0
1743,"I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .",0
1744,"First day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .",1
1745,But I was really disappointed it .,1
1746,"First of all , there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement .",0
1747,"Also , it was certain to me to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student .",1
1748,"But , it was not availiable .",1
1749,"Second , I went to the theatre exactly seven thirty in the evening .",1
1750,However the show started 45 minutes later .,1
1751,I wasted time too much for waiting .,1
1752,"It was not good to me , cause I had only one week holiday in London .",1
1753,"Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word "" Stuff vacation "" on the front door after the show .",1
1754,It was absolutely different from your leaflet .,1
1755,"On the whole , I was really disappointed at that time .",0
1756,Could you do me my half of money back .,1
1757,I enclose my phone number and address .,0
1758,I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .,0
1759,Yours faithfully Lo Son Lin .,0
1760,Fashion of the Future .,0
1761,Have you ever seen the film star wars ?,0
1762,And did you notice something about fashion of the future ?,0
1763,I think the people will wear convenient clothes with simple design in the future .,1
1764,Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer .,0
1765,And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk .,1
1766,"However , if they have some special day when like important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you never seen before .",1
1767,"Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of others will be familiar to us .",1
1768,And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc. Maybe some peoples are nakid .,1
1769,It will be very interesting ... Just imagine the way of future people 's life .,1
1770,And you can see the their clothes also .,1
1771,"13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan , Thank you very much for your letter .",0
1772,I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize .,1
1773,First of all because I have never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .,1
1774,"The only time that is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .",1
1775,For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece .,1
1776,The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing .,1
1777,"In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say , that I am quite good in climbing .",1
1778,"But I have never ' surfed ' in my live , so that is an activity I have to learn .",1
1779,Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of wheather do you have in California ?,1
1780,Is it very hot ?,0
1781,What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?,0
1782,And what about money ?,0
1783,How much money Should I take with me ?,1
1784,Are there any activities which are not included ?,0
1785,And my last question : how many persons are going to stay in each tent .,1
1786,I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .,0
1787,"Yours sincerely Many people , especially women , love shopping .",0
1788,If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .,1
1789,But shopping is not always enjoyable .,0
1790,First of all because of the big variety in the store .,1
1791,"Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .",1
1792,And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .,0
1793,Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .,1
1794,Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .,0
1795,"And many people are in a hurry , so do n't wonder if other people have not tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars .",1
1796,"Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .",1
1797,"That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complaine .",1
1798,"That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about .",1
1799,"Dear Mrs Helen Ryan , I was writting as reply of your letter , I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .",1
1800,"About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months .",1
1801,"With the accomodation , I would prefered tents becase it is more according with a camp .",1
1802,And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things .,1
1803,"Finally I just ask you What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me , and around How much money do you think I will need .",1
1804,Thank you very much for everything .,0
1805,"Your Sincerely Juanita Fabiola Martin 31 Sea old State Valles Co. Cornel Wales 13th June , 2000 Dear Kim , Here I am , writting you to tell everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .",1
1806,You ca n't imagine How much did I enjoy that journey .,1
1807,"I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played , I help with the music stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound , etc. And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started .",1
1808,And I was helping them fixing the last details .,1
1809,When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .,1
1810,After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .,1
1811,"Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .",0
1812,But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions .,1
1813,"So , that 's everything that I can tell you , I enjoy a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .",1
1814,Thank you for the letter you have sent recently .,0
1815,It was a surprise to know that I won the first prize .,1
1816,"The reasons I am really writing , However , is to give you some details of my trip to California .",1
1817,I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .,0
1818,In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins .,1
1819,I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .,1
1820,Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing ( because I take part in a chorus at school ) and photography .,1
1821,"I 'm really good taking pictures , it 's a way I have to express my feelings .",1
1822,I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring .,1
1823,Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp .,0
1824,I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is .,0
1825,thanking you in anticipation .,0
1826,I look forward to hearing from you .,0
1827,"Yours faithfully , What a surprise it was to get letter from you after all this time .",1
1828,Sorry I have n't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job .,0
1829,This is just to let you know with whom I worked .,0
1830,"In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city , the Coun Council organised an open air concert .",1
1831,"It was a summer night and all the citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend .",0
1832,"The pop band "" Five "" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound .",1
1833,I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager .,0
1834,"I could n't believe when he said : "" O.K. if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do .",1
1835,""" My job was to leave some leaflets on shops , restaurants and streets .",1
1836,Working with this band was an experience I will never forget .,0
1837,What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff .,1
1838,"Although I was too nervious , I knew I could do the job well .",1
1839,"I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?",1
1840,Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .,0
1841,I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .,0
1842,"Love from , Dear Mr or Madam , I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play "" over the rainbow "" which is performing at Circle Theatre .",1
1843,"First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor .",0
1844,"Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage , during the play .",1
1845,"Therefore , the theatre or the company is lying .",0
1846,"Secondly , the show started one hour fifteen past after .",1
1847,We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .,1
1848,"Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an agressive employee refused to answer me .",1
1849,He stayed looking at me and laughing .,0
1850,It was incredible .,0
1851,"The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promise written in the advertisement .",1
1852,"Defineteley , I want my money back as soon as possible .",1
1853,"I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully "" Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .",0
1854,""" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told everything about Lynne Harter , our new collegue at school .",1
1855,"However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .",0
1856,"Well , it was the beginning of my tragedy .",1
1857,"So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely agressive .",1
1858,"But I could n't shut my mouth , I continued : "" You ca n't believe it Pat , she wears trousers like men and green flowery blouses "" Of course , my friend and I were laughing during half an hour .",1
1859,"Two days after , when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter , our head teacher , she told everything about Ann1 .",1
1860,In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter 's niece .,1
1861,I know it 's my fault .,0
1862,"But , well , unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets .",1
1863,"Dear Sir , I 'm writing to complain for the musical show "" Over the Rainbow "" .",1
1864,I 've been recently seeing in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening !,1
1865,"I was sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !",1
1866,"Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !",1
1867,"If the spectacle has been beautiful , I would have been quite pleased to wait .",1
1868,"Then , I had read that there would have been discounts available , but it was n't true !",1
1869,So it 's better not to write anything if you do n't make it true then .,1
1870,"Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme : starring !",1
1871,"The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .",0
1872,"Finished the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this has n't been said before .",1
1873,"Moreover , I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed : the chef went away after he received a phone call !",1
1874,"For all these reason , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !",1
1875,A suggestion ?,0
1876,Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity !,1
1877,"Yours sincerely , There would be many things to say about .",1
1878,Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly .,1
1879,"It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .",0
1880,I 'm not sure if I must say technology has changed our life in positive or not .,1
1881,"Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .",0
1882,"Nowadays , we make a phone call with an astonish rapidity , instead at my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !",1
1883,"When appeared the first car , it was already a great success .",1
1884,"Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .",0
1885,"Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else he wants !",1
1886,What can I say about the television ?,1
1887,"It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which happened or will happen .",1
1888,"In the not very far 1914 , parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !",1
1889,It 's terrible !,0
1890,"Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community , not only phisically .",1
1891,"We pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that are n't money , success , power .",0
1892,"We became passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .",1
1893,"I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .",1
1894,"Finally , everyone should decrease his own life 's rythm .",1
1895,"Mr John Smythe , I 'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday .",0
1896,"I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it will .",1
1897,"First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .",1
1898,"Second of all , the play was suposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .",1
1899,"I 'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .",1
1900,"Another thing I want to complain about , is that your advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .",1
1901,"To finish my "" marvelous "" evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .",0
1902,"As I did n't have a "" perfect evening out "" , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .",0
1903,I hope you understand .,0
1904,"Yours faithfully Pat 's story Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .",0
1905,"Now you 've probably asking yourself what does it mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .",1
1906,"Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .",0
1907,We used to tell everything to each other .,0
1908,"I was having some family problems , so my marks were getting down and down .",1
1909,"Pat was worried , she did n't know what to do .",0
1910,"One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look , Never have I seen such a deep look : and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .",1
1911,That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise .,0
1912,"It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hack the school software .",1
1913,"I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do .",1
1914,"Pat could n't stand the pressure of the "" crime "" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .",0
1915,"I was punished , nearly expelt , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .",1
1916,"I never accused her of lying , and I you ask me why , I really do n't know .",1
1917,"Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .",0
1918,"Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .",0
1919,"I was displeased from the very beginning , because I expected to get a discount as I 'm a student .",0
1920,According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .,1
1921,But nevertheless I decided to go to your show .,0
1922,The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30 .,1
1923,I had to wait in overcrowded hall .,1
1924,When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor .,1
1925,One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participance .,1
1926,"So , you could understand how disappointed I was .",0
1927,To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed .,1
1928,"So I had n't such perfect evening , as was promised in your advertisment .",1
1929,In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money .,1
1930,I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .,0
1931,"Yours faithfully , How has modern technology changed your daily life ?",0
1932,"In my opinion , modern technologies play the important role in people 's life .",1
1933,I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies .,1
1934,Both computer and Internet influence people 's life .,1
1935,I have to use computer every day .,1
1936,It helps me in preparing my homeworks .,1
1937,Firs of all Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information .,1
1938,"On the one hand Internet is often used for entertaiment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education process !",1
1939,With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me chance to improve my English .,1
1940,"From my point of view , Internet can be used in education , because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers .",1
1941,Though Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it .,1
1942,8 Jun 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Sir At the begining I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much .,1
1943,I have always dreamt about holidays ' in Camp California ' However there are some problems that I hope to solve .,0
1944,First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July .,0
1945,It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down .,1
1946,If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to the nature .,1
1947,I would like You to know also about my two hobbys : swimming and surfing .,1
1948,I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at ' Camp California ' .,1
1949,There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about .,1
1950,The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?,0
1951,Yours sincerely Anna Nowak Unconected part of every people lifes is shopping .,1
1952,We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money .,1
1953,As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping .,1
1954,"It 's like ,,walking in the clouds , , you feel like flaing .",1
1955,Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes .,1
1956,It all comes from my parents .,0
1957,All I ought to do is buy and choose .,1
1958,"I think that ,,having is a dream of all of us .",1
1959,It 's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable .,1
1960,Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you ca n't have it .,1
1961,Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present .,0
1962,"Everybody know that ,,present presents a problem You know your own task but what vith a task of the other person ?",1
1963,"However I ca n't agree with opinion that ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable I think that everybody like to buy but not everybody like to see pleasure in it .",1
