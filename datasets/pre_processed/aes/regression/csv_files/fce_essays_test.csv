237," Dear manager, I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show which was OVER THE RAINBOW, however, I had a very disappointing evening. There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show on the advertisement and the ones it actually was. Firstly the starring on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors on the musical show. Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leafet but it actually started at 20:15. Thirdly it said there were discounts available on the advertisement, however, there was not any at all. Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was colsed because your excuse of being used at that moment. It said on the leafet that your perfect evening out, while it was not  at all. I felt very disappointing after seeing the music show in your theatre. As I said the reasons above, I want to ask for  money back! I look forwards to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was so kind that the couldn't stop telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown After finishing that Pat left this room. Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart throbbing quickly. She went quietly downstair and closed the door as soon as she went into her room. At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind which seemed as  just happened yesterday. ""Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?"" She said to herself ""I am just a servant in this castle, I loves him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle."" while it seemed as  a shadow came in from the window and disappeared quickly. Everything in the room is quiet except the sound of the clock as if everything is going to die. She was so frighten and sad that she had no energry. She fell down onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her. ",20.0
192," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show presented in your theatre. Indeed, I recently spent a week's holiday in London and I went to the theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". It was really a very disappointing evening. I was disappointed to see that Danny Brook, announced on your advertisement, did not act in this show. Indeed, he was replaced by a different actor for this evening. Additionally, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, and I had to pay the full price for my ticket as no discount was available. However, the worst was to come as it was impossible to eat something after the show. Indeed, the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was ill. I hope you can imagine my great disappointment. Therefore, I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Science and technology have played an important role for the last twenty years and the development of the modern technology has especially affected our lives. To take my personal example, I would be no more able to live without some of the most recent discoveries, which make my daily life easier. For instance, I can't imagine living without using a computer to write my scholar works, to play a game or to order some goods on the Internet. This latter is a new media which has changed my life, as it is a marvellous tool  to communicate, learn or have fun. Another important change related to the modern technology are the credit cards. Until I have had one, I was often run out of cash and had to go to the bank. At the present time, thanks to my credit card, I can really buy what I want, when I want and where I want! To sum up, there are many other discoveries in relation with the modern technology which affect my daily life. However it would be too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you also know them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life. ",29.0
790," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize, a two week holiday at Camp California in  U.S.A, and that you need further information from me. Firstly, I would like to travel on July, because  is the only month I have holidays in. Secondly, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they're more comfortable than the tents, also because I don't like to sleep in tents very much, I think they're very cold during the night About the activities, I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it, and also because I know very well how to play. I used to be the captain of the selection of bascketball in my school, because I was the best to play, and I think I can still remember how to play. The second activity I chose was tennis, I am not so good, but I know how to play, I have played several times with my friends. To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like for example shampoo, soap, etc. so that I don't have to carry them in my luggage, I think they would just occupy extra space. Another thing I would like to ask you for, is money. I think it will be an expensive trip and I don't have enough money to pay for it. Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and souvenirs that I can buy in the Camp. I think that's all, and I look foreword to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely, Santiago Rico S  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, ""If I had more money, I would buy it"", or ""I wish I had more money."" Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable. ",29.0
551," Dear Helen I'm very happy for winning the first prize in the competition. I think it would be a very good experience for me. I'm realy excited about it. Fist of all I'm going to give  some informations about me. Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment, in a company, and I'll only have two weeks off in the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July. I'd love to come earlier, but I realy can't because this job is very important for me, and I'll need it as a work experience, for my further studies in the University. I will also appreciate , if you would offer me accomodation in a log cabin, because of some health problems that I have, which are not allow me to leave outsid on the ground, and to be honest with you, I never liked camping. I'd also like to choose photography and painting from the list of activities, because I've studied Arts for three years, and these two are my favourite hobbies. I'd also like to ask you how much money I'll need for these two weeks, and what kind of clothes should I take with me, because I've never been to the States, and I don't know how the weather is  in California during the summer. I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is an obsession for all of us. We all like going out to the shops, and spend hours, looking  all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us. But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you are going with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women and especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on any kind of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they are not buying anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I spent the whole morning doing nothing, except from looking at them trying  diferent clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's realy annoying. Also, you have to be careful when you go for shopping with children. Children always ask for something and they want to have all they toys which they see and that's not very enjoyable for the parents, because sometimes they spend more money, from the amount of money that they have planned.

1077," Sir Robertson, We are really appriciate  about giving  very nice program, which is organised by your this time.

Invent glass was very eventuly to architect. Architecuture with use of grass brough us the modenism in 1980. In the future we can expect having  new material and it will make our living more confortable and convinient. In Japan, crime of minority is increasing. It said that as one of the reasons  small separete room makes kids unsociable and dissapointed. Therefore Japanese architect consider designing of use many glasses as much as they can in house and try not to create speparate dark room. Otherwise as producing new electoronic, our home of  future will be more convinient. On the other hand  inside of the house will be too simple. Although  high might be still  same. Because human high won't change so much, unless 10000 years passed. ",17.00
945," Dear Sirs, Thank you, it's great to hear for about my winning. You ask me for some informations - here they are. First I can do the travel only in July, because I can't get  freetime in any other month. The next thing is, that I would prefer a log cabine. I don't want to sleep in a tent, because I'm afraid of snakes and similar animals. About the activities during the Camp I can tell you, that I like to play Tennis and I do it very good. Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play Golf. It's a very favourite sport also in our region (area), but I did never found time to do it. I'm a beginner in Golf you have to know. Now a question from me to you: Is it possible to pay  the different things with credit-card? Another question - what sorts of clothes shall I bring with me? Is July a hot and dry month or is it raining sometimes? I think, this will be all I want to know. If there is any other question from your part, please call me or write again. I'm looking forward to hear from you, yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hi Kim, sorry, I'm late I know, but now I will tell you something about my experience last month. The concert started on the 15th of may and it was a real great session in our valley. I was so happy when they told me to help them with the organisation. I was responsible to the advertisments and I had also to invite the ""important persons"" from our governement. It was realy a new job for me, but I think, I have done good. I've learned a lot about management and especially - how stars are living. One evening we went all together out for diner and after we visited  our new disco. We arrived at home early in the morning - it was great. Now Kim, I will finish my letter but I promise you to write again as soon as possible, maybe if I've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the .... A good idea at least - you come here and I tell you some other story's. In the meanwhile enjoy your life - love ",34.0
1195," Dear Mrs Smith I am writing to answer your letter about the details of  international students conference.  Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is  North City Line,  is  yellow line on the map. After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station which is for twenty minutes,  is in front of the conference . The conference which will be held from 1 pm through 4 pm, is a formal party. You should wear formal clothes, and are going to play a game and enjoy  welcome drink together. Before catching our plane, we will be able to enjoy going shopping around the airport for three hours in the afternoon. Because there are so many unique shops and you should buy good gifts for your parents Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mr Wolf I am writing to answer your question about the information on an interesting building to visit. I would like to introduce one building in my town. ""Sky Heaven"" which is the name of the building, is for fifteen minutes from the centre of my town. This building have a hundred floor and it takes for five minutes  from the grand to the top in the elevator. There are many facilities which are a museum, a exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping. The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world. You should get  the top of the building and experience such a amazing view. Another reason is that there is a good museum, which tell you about the history of my town so easily and clearly. It is a good experience for your students. I hope you will accept my recommendation and am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  ",26.00
938," Dear Sir or Madame, I'm so glad to get the news I've won the prize. Many thanks for giving me a chance to stay at the Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I could leave for the camp in July. Because I'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth, England until June and then I'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip. We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling. So I can go to the camp in the middle of the July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I've had unpleasant experience from my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent. In addition as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin. Most of all, I'm so happy that I could choose some activities. I'd like to practice golf and tennis. Both of them are my favorite sports and I'm quite good. I think I should ask you about something more. How's the weather there? Which kind of clothes  I have to bring and how much money I will need? Could you tell me about them? I'll be grateful if you could send me further information. I'll look forward to your reply.  Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  When I was asked what I do in my free time, I've never hesitated to say, ""I enjoy going shopping."" I'm very extroverted. So I like spend my energy doing sports or some kinds of energetic activity. I thought going shopping was suitable for me. Especially when I visit somewhere for the first time or I have nothing to do, but lots of time, I naturally and automatically look for a decent shopping centre. But nowadays I found shopping is not always enjoyable. Since I started living in England, I've worked two part time jobs as a cleaner. I can't make enough money for my living expense. I have to control my expenses on the budget. It's not easy for me, as I used to depend on my parents before I came here.  Anyway I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets. What makes me desperate is a nice summer dress I've found in a department store. I really wanted to buy it, but I couldn't afford to buy it. I realised that shopping is not always enjoyable. ",30.0
163," Dear Mister I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment: ""Over the Rainbow"". As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland, we apreciate to pass a week in London every year. We are keen on theatre and musical show. Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles. We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed ""The Drama"" you presented last year. Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. At first, we couldn't get any discount, although you mention it on your advertisment. And the only tickets left were at £20. Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration. Therefore I ask you to give use £20 back, because the two tickets were not more worth. I'm looking forward to hearing soon from you. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was following a course all the week in Berne. The kids were by their grandmother, who take care of them. I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't any swimming-clothes. I knew a good place. I parked the car and went ten minuts. As I had planed, the place was deserted. I took my clothes of and swam  twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too. Unfortunately a police car drove by and the policeman saw me standing there nude. They drove me to their office after having given me use of their shirt. There I called Pat who picked me up. I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me. Of course she told everything to my husband. If only Pat could keep secrets! ",30.0
796," Dear Ms Ryan I'm so happy to received your letter, and I want to tell you the information you need. I would like the travel start only  july if possible, because this is my Hoilday start, at the Camp California I would like my accommodation in  tents, because I work in  Army and in the camp I usually stay in  tent at night, so I will feel more comfortable.

The lessons we take in the video, should be the main subject we study. In the video I think we should take part to talk about, what we doing in  feel time and study period. This is another important part of our school life, and we should make a section to talk about lunch and where are the people go to eat their lunch or what they do? After we talk about lunch, we should take about  activities we are doing and the systems about the activities in school or outside school and make a little section of the School term, and what kind of sport the people like the most. At the end of the video, we should find one or two studen sit together and ask them a few question of how do they feel  to study in the School? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school.

Sincerely,  [SEP]  Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate. The class had organized a secret party for our friend, Nick that was leaving the school on 2 more weeks. All started when Pat, the best friend of Nick, wanted to make the party in his house, most of the class disagree with that because the house of Pat is extremly little, they started to say  him that his house was like a box. Pat got very angree and sad. Pat affected with this situation told Nick all  the situation and the secret of the class. At the beginning Nick got angree but then he forgive him because they were friend and each of one can trust on the other. Nick told the situation to the class and ofered his house to do the party, because  was very big, with large gardens and a big swimingpool. The day of the party all had fun especially Pat that at the beggining was sad. ",23.0
1106," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to   your advertisement about the ""London Fashion"" and ""Leisure Show"". Thank you for organising this good programme, especially the Leisure show, which  very interest  us. So all of our class would like to go to the show during the three days in London. But there is a problem which I hope you can solve. According to your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which included in sightseeing by bus,  River trip to Greenwich,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery  so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. From these we can see the latest fashion, imagintive make up and hairstyles. What is more they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it. In your advertisement, you had written ""The show will be help in  Central Exhibition hall in London, it starts from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March. I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves. But I wonder if the timetable could change, which will be perfect. As you know, all of us want to join the programme, so if some students go to  Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show. For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities. In my opinion, we had better go to  show instead of  science museum and shopping, also we can go to  Science Museum on 15th March, which instead of the free time in the afternoon. I am sorry to make your inconveint. I hope it doesn't make some trouble if you accept my suggestion. I look forward to receiving your apply as soon as possible. your sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Because..... Last night, when I went into my house it was quite scilence. I felt there might be something  has gone wrong. I found my parents sitting in a armchair. I could see sadness in my father's eyes. My mother came over to me and said softly, ; my dear, your father's company has jut gone bankrupt', then she couldn't help crying. When I hear this bad news, I was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company. My father always remembered his responsibily was giving  good salary to his worker, which is the view of his life. So I must find out a solution which can help my great father. One day, I suddenly got a good idea. 'Why not go to  sock exchange?' I said to myself. Almost every day I stayed in there and research the exchange decline-line, which give me lots of information from there. Finally, I decide to join  the dangerous game, which will lost everything or suddenly become  millionaire. With luck, I was won by chance. When I with mixed mood went home I found my parents were stooding at the door looked like very cheerful. 'Surely it doesn't mean that they have learnt the exciting news?' I said to myself again. Much to my surprise, they told me in high voice that they never went bankrupt, they wanted to give me a opportunity to do something impressive by myself. Now, they are both prouding of me! ",17.00
212," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which I have seen in The Circle Theatre on 6th June. On that date, I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in  musial show. But things started to go wrong from the beginning. The first problem was the price of tickets. I expected to buy  ticket cheaply but no discounts were available. Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late. I found the theater rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row. Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time. However, something wrong came up again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brocher, did not play a part in the show. And I  really disappointed from the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after  show, but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior. I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from  advertisement. I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund. I expect to receive a cheque for £20.  look forward to hearing soon. Yours faithfully    [SEP]  It's comletely different! Have you ever been to  fashion show named ""New trend, New Millenium""? 'It's completely different! How can we go our wearing thouse clothes?' This is what my friend said the other day when she went to see the show with me. These days, new designs and new trends are coming out every day, sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days  we were young. However, It doesn't seem to take long for most of young people to get used to it, so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future. In my opinion, I believe that clothes indicate  individual's creativity as well as social situation. We never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age. On the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre to wear nothing. Let's face it. Clothes are always changing. But the question no one  answer is what is  fashion in 100 year's time?  ",30.0
1150," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I read your letters and I'm ready to help you. I think that we have to think  which hotel is better for the students. I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me. I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it's very nice and cheap. It has comfortable bedrooms and  place for parties. You can book this hotel it's the best and it's near to  conference it's only 15 minutes by walk. I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance. The party it will be nice. The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart, not how you are going to  casino for example but nice casual, not with sports shoes or T-shirts. On the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places. Those are my ideas for the conference. I hope that you will like it. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Today our article it will be about an inventions that we need inour life. I think that all this things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things. First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make  call if you need something of if it something happend to your house and nobody is next to you. The second one is the lamp, the electricity that is very important in our life. In the past the people didn't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire. It's important to have electricity because without this you can't do anything. The other one is the television. You must have  TV because you can liten  what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you didn't go . You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have  free time. The boat it's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places. The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want. In this year the familys they have 3 cars in one family one by one person. For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you can't do anything, it's part of my life. ",21.00
1193," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday. I do welcome you and your group, and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me . Firstly, let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference. The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there  many ways to get to the conference. The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes. The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening. Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech, and after that dinner will be served. The party is not very formal, so you can wear any kind of dress, as long as it is suitable for dinner. Finally, I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day's free time. It must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere. It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing. I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information. I look forward to seeing you soon, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  . Report on Kyoung Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom. . Introduction . This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace, which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries. It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples, and makes a final recommendation. . History . The kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of  20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size. As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army. . Activity . The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tends to dislike the historical visit, would be the various activity. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace. . Final Recommendation . It is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history. You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea. ",37.00
670," Miss Helen Ryan: Last week I recived your letter in wich you told me that I won first prize. I am writting in response of it. First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July with my school holidays, in order not to lose classes. I think I would prefer to be in  tents, because I think it is funnier and you can be in more contact with nature, but if I don't like the tents can I change my mind? You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. In both of them I am very good. I did a surf course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life. I have a few questions. How much money should I take to spend in those two weeks? and also what kind of clothes I should take? Please, when you recive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  We are going to do a video about daily life at school, the following classes are the ones I recomend to film. ENGLISH: the classroom is beautifull, and in the same day we do a lot of diferents activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there. CHEMISTRY: We do a lot of experiments and the materials we use are very good. I think that if we film that class the people that watches it will be impress with the equipment we have got. SPANISH: We are doing a play now. We could film it and produce it, instead of uniform we could wear costumes, the ones that are animals could pain their faces. I think that if we do it properly we could have a great spanish play. Those three classes are my choises, I hope we could do them and make a very good video about our school. ",24.0
568," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to answer the questions you asked me in the last letter you sent me. Firstly, I can only travel on July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in  tents a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to practise Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some excersise while I am on vacation. I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have practised them all my life. I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won. Firstly, what kind of clothes  I have to take to the camp, clothes for hot or cold weather?. I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me, too? Those are all my questions. I am looking forward  receiving your reply. Please write  me soon. Yours sincerely Eleonora Jimenez.  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am writing to tell you about my experience at a pop concert last month. As you know, I am a member of a BSB fan club, and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live. Firstly, I helped selling the tickets. That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go. The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes, which it was. What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talk with them about their lifes as  a pop group. I also enjoyed being able to work as  a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB. It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life I am looking forward  hearing from you.

352," To the manager of the Circle Theatre - London Dear sir, I write to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I saw last night. Firstly I was very disappointed in finding out that not-ever-heard actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected. Besides this, no discounts for students were available. I'm very sorry to let you know that not only was the show really boring, but it started also 45  late - This shouldn't happen! In addition to this, I heard bad singers and noticed a numertable lack of variety in  ballets. Furthermore I couldn't drink a cup of coffee after the show in the theatre restaurant. I've been told it was closed because of a waiters' strike. I know this is not up to you, but it was very annoying. This show might be the newest in London, but   not the best at all. I do eventually think it would be fair to give the spectators their money back - So  ask you  a complete refund (cash) of the ticket price. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We all know that she isn't good in keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time. Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days. Their parents were so happy that  decided to give him a fantastic present: the brand new car he had always dreamed of. This should be a big surprise for him: the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush-hush atmosphere. Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car, but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend ""It will be delievered on Thursday! Can you imagine Philip's face when he'll see his favourite car out there?"" He couldn't believe his ears! The great day came. The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual  activity all over the house. Everyone seemed to be looking for something. ""Are you looking for these?"" asked Philip showing the keys of the car. And  disappeared heading for the rear door. ",36.0
559," Dear Mrs. Ryan, in your letter I received a few days ago, you asked me to give you some more information concerning my journey to the U.S.A. I'm a teacher in Vienna, my holiday starts on July 1st. For August I booked a journey to Greece with my wife. That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S. in July. I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I gothave become accostomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at the army - I would prefer  log cabin for my stay in the camp. Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy, I still enjoy swimming especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition, that means I do swimming just for fun. The other activity I choose is Photography. Usually I take just holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art.... I think there are no more questions I'm looking forward to seeing you. Yours  [SEP]  I'm the teacher of that class. The children are seven to eight years old. The video that will be made should demonstrate how  day in school is like. - I start the day by greeting the children and they answer - in English, of course. Then I tell them to sit down. - The first lesson will deal with animals on a farm. I will show pictures of animals and the children will tell me the name of that animal. - Later on we'll go to sing the song of ""Old McDonald had a farm"". - The third part of the film will show the children's painting work ""Animals on a farm"". - Some sequences of the gym-lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that presents how  children have their lunch and spend their free-time, what games they play in the school-yard and how they have contact with each other. Each part of the film mentioned above should not be longer than 5 to 10 minutes. The whole film when it's finished will last for about half an hour. ",30.0
201," Dear Sir or Madam. A few days ago I went to your theatre to see a musical show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it, I was expected  opposit. First of all the advertisement where you have advertised your program and what the theatre was providing for you is totaly wrong. A came to look at my favorit actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but  whom I saw were another people. Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy a tickets and when I apeared infrant of  casses I found out that the cost of  tickets on your advertisement and  real price wasn't the same,  real price was much higher. Also  show started very late compere to what was writen on the advertisement. And I think you know how it is just sit and wait for 45min. befor the beggining? So, after all of that, I wanted to have a nice relaxing diner in your restaurant, I was very angry when I apeared infrant of closed doors and there was a notice, that the restaurant wasn't working. In fact  writing to you just with one main reason. I'll be really delightful to resive back the money for my ticket. I'm looking forword  hearing from you. Faithfuly yours Lena Jarova  [SEP]  Begin at the begining. Look at  historical books  400-600 years ago, or even in  time of  First and Second World War,  how are sociaty changed, just because we did step up in the  science and technology. In one hand scientist discovered a lot of medisent from different illneses, but in an enother hand they discovered many illneses about which we haven't herd before. I think this side of the question is balanced because before  effect on our health was less than it is now. More and more people died from some illness wheres  long time ago less people died from  illneses, dispite that fact that they had less medisent. However technology nowerdays impoved so much and it changed our life a lot. Today we can't even think how we could possibly leave without computers or without airplanes. Computer it is our way of with  outside world comunicat, wheres with airplanes we can rich our parents, friends easily and much faster, then if we would  use bouts or trains. Everyday scientist and technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and it is good, it has to be like that, we have to do forword not behind from the point where we are now. Society has to go forword not to stop on one place. ",20.0
361," Dear Sir! I am writing to you because of the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" I saw in your theatre last week. I looked forward  a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had. Firstly, you did not tell the truth about  starring. The advertisement of the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook, unfortunately there was someone else - an actor which I do not like and if I have known that he was going to be  I woud not have come to see him. Secondly, it was supposed to start at 19.30 but  actually started at 20.15. Forty five minutes later! You also have mentioned about the discounts and there were not any. Lastly, the restaurant which was going to be opened was in fact closed without a reason ! Keeping in mind all these arguments, I want to ask you for some money back. I think it could be your nice apologise for all my problems and disappointments. Your faithfuly,  [SEP]  Contemporary modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives. It is always with us: in our homes, in the places we work and learn. It affects our lifes, my too. In fact modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life rapidly. But I am also sure, that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me since the very beging of my day. For example I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water, next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the ideas of the technology. On the other hand, I am aware of all these disadvantages of the modern technology; pollution and  dangarous it brings. But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary - the age of modern science. Finally, I think that we cannot talk only about  changes which the modern technology has brought to our lives. That's because that I think that we are the one who change the technology as well. I think that our lives are lives with technology, they sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together. So how has the modern technology changed my daily life? I don't know how it would be like without the technology. ",30.0
9," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you to give some opinion about the International Arts Festival that you have organized last November. First of all, I believe that it was very interesting, but there were few artists than I have expected. In fact they came from six countries. I wonder if it is possible for next year to have more artists and also bigger concert halls. In fact I have noticed that some concert need to more space. I would be grateful if, next year, you could put more art exhibitions (with more pictures) in the program. I was very interested in the ticket of Festival. It was not expensive and  easy to use, because it was only one for all the events. I would offer you one suggestion that concers the classical concerts. I think it would be interesting to invite young compositors to hear news from the classical music. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Magda, how are you? Well, I hope. I'm O.K. I've just received your letter and I'm going to reply to your questions. In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools. For example, we have to wear in  appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers. At this time, in my school there is a new rule. We aren't allowed to use the mobile phone in class. Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster. And now about my home. I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time in which my family can eat together. For me, it's very stressfull and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like cheat with my class mates after our lessons. I'd like to change a rule at home. I'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m. It's a boring rule. Neighbours have complained about loud music. Write to me soon about news in your life. Love ",23.00
896," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel on July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month. For the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I can not sleep in  tent. I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for speed sensations. I am good in those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend. I would like to now more information about clothes. I think that  weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold, but I do not know if I must take  lot of pullovers. Best regards Henri  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a statement  of men in general. Women like to go to do shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands. Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive. Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because the shopping loses a lot of time  controry to  women, because if they have a free time, they will go to do shopping. I think that  child does not like shopping because he often waits, and I prefer to play with these friends. He goes to do shopping only if he has not clothes. To conclude, I think that ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a true statement, but not always for all people. ",25.0
72," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to thank you for providing  International Arts Festival. It was  absolutely great idea. However, I would like to give some suggestions for next year as I have read the advertisement. Firstly, could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries? In my opinion, it might be better to have time with  variety  nationallites. Secondly, the music concerts were very exciting and  had a lot of fun, but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably. Thirdly, I am expecting to watch more films and plays which were impressive. Lastly, it could be nice to students who are interested in  arts, if you help special events, for instance,  song contest, writing competition or dance lessons. To sum up, I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year's. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  PART TIME JOBS : Find in your place Do you need money?

If you just decide to work, you'd better to find a job in your place. Firstly, go to your school or local council. They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you. Secondly, as your family or friends. As they know about your interestings and personality, it is easy to help you. In my case, I could get a telephone researcher part by my friend's reference.

I am very pleased to give you the information required: Firstly, the most suitable month would be in July because I am very busy in my work now, and my children are in holiday then. Secondly, I prefer to stay in log cabins, because they are more comfortable. I confess you that I have never been in a tent and till now I have never had the intention  to do it. The activities are really interesting and I would take part on Painting and Climbing. I am not very good  painting, but I like it because  is a good oportunity to practice it. Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body. I don't want to dissapoint you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges. I would appreciate  if you can tell me a couple of ideas about  clothes I  need there. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, G.

Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, brother of Catherine, hatted Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason he sent Heathcliff to work in the farm.

Firstly, I was disapointed, because the actor Danny Brook did not appeared in the show. Then, another thing I would like to mention is that the time advertised was wrong, because the show started at 20:15. Another thing is that there were discounts on the price of the tickets, and I did not have any discount. It also puts that there was a restaurant to eat in after the show, but it was closed because it was not completely built. Finally, I would like to know why  would have a perfect evening, because I did not have one, so I would like to have my money back. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.

She got very surprised when Pat told her that he was gay. During the week Pat and Peter talked about the problem he had and the consequences that will occured if he told it to his parents. On Saturday Peter, Pat and some other friends went to the cinema. When they saw the film, Katy and John approached to Peter and told him that they will continue being his friends. Peter got very angry and told Pat why did they say that to him. Pat did not answer to him.

356," 17th Juni 2000 The manager of the Circle Theatre Dear Sir, I'm in London  first time and I wondered what is interesting on yours stage: I read in  newspaper the advertisment about  best musical show. In  advertisment  starring was very interested - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I desided to go to your theatre but at the beginning  was the tranbles. In  advertisment  was - ""discounts available"". I'm  teacher and in Polan I have discounts but in England no, I know this is other country. I was disappointed because you wrote about it! Otherwise, the musical show started too late at 20 15 not 17 30! This was a waste of time. I was very suppresed when I saw  different actor, it wasn't Danny Brook. This musical show wasn't ""the best"". I went out earlier but the theatre restaurant was closed. I had  very disappointing evening. I would ask you for  money back. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  ""Fashion of the Future"" What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This is  very interesting question for us and maybe very important too. We think and speak about it in our families. I saw one week ago on TV (the 23th annual) the fashion show in Paris and I was very surrprised because of this style. All  models had a very strange long shoes made from black skin, the trouses was quite short and the jackets was elegant with blazzend materiell. I think the fashion of the future will be very different but suitable for all people. The people will wear clothes  from natural materials like silk,  comfortable and elgant. The colours will be  very good quality and the fashion will be changed very quickly like now. Because the world is now a global village the people will wear at least one part of traditional or national clothes (for example  peasnt jacket or hat) like  now in rural areas from time to time.

Here are the following points, which I do not think that you have realised what you have put down. 1 The advertisement says the show starts at 19:30. Unfortunately it started at 20:15. And I think I could find something  worth to do than just writing, doing nothing during this spare time. 2 I was expected that there would be discount available for people who have student card as it says in the notice, but there was not. 3 You recommend that there will be the resturant after the show. However all I can see, the light was off and the door was locked. This is because they are rebuilding it again. 4 I have also thought in the show there was no different actor. 5 Never the less, I took my headmistress with me and I have recommened how wonderful this show was going to be. It would be greatful if you consider to return my money for the tickets back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully. Sapawadee Prisuntha.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future - F.O.F. - These 3 F could tell you whether you are up-to-date. The first thing for fashion what is called ""clothing"" or what they wear.  1st ""F"" is from ""fast-food"", something fast and easy to be spotted, which is  ancient wearing style. This is not nomally what people wear everyday.  2nd F is 'fulfill' wear ever you have under your mom's cupboard. For example long baggy troossers, which cover your bright brick shoes. Wherever you go every one would love you because of your troussers,  would clean  all the rubbish that are on the road.  3rd ""F"" could not be anything else apart from something that could make you look ""fool"". Having holes all around your body (including unsuitable place), which could make you look like an animal such as having a big metal ring in your nose etc. If it is not these 3F booming in 100 years from now, so what else could you think of?

I would like to complain  four things about your theatre. Fist thing, the actor is very horrible so I recommend you to change the actor because he will make an audience who visit you theatre disappoint. Second thing, you should open the show on time because if the audience have to wait, they will not feel happy but I think you know that. According to the advertisement, it said tickets £ 10, £ 15 and £ 20 discounts available but when I bought the ticket, the discounts did not available After the show I was very hungry so I went to the restaurant in the theatre but it was closed for decorating that make me very angry and disappoint. To conclude, your theatre is not good like what advertisement said so I would like to ask for some money back. I look forward to hearing from you.

For example, when I was young, I used to walk to school everyday but now my father has a car so I don't have to walk anymore, because my father gives me a lift everyday. At home, I have a video game so I play it all the time and I'm very enjoy that  make my daily life happy so it's excellent but on the other hand I didn't do any homework or study at all. Another example is  computer, I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can know the news by using  internet in the computer. To sum up, the modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways. Therefore my daily life will change to bad ways or goods ways, it depends on how I use the technology. ",21.0

484," Dear Manager, I am writing this letter to remind you  some faults of your theatre. I think this will help your organization to improve itself. From my point of view, your organisation has to be careful to orginize an activity. Last week I was in London. I attended to your activity. I'm sorry but I didn't have a good remark of your activity when I left. I know the quality of your organization. That's why I wanted to write  you. First time, when I saw the advertisement on the newspaper, I really appreciated. I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible. Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling. Finally, time passed and it was supposed to begin. But it didn't. I waited 45 minutes more to see the play. Anyway, it wasn't important for me. Because, I believe that if you want to get a satisfaction you have to sacrifice a little bit. But it wasn't all. On the other hand, I couldn't see the same actors whose name were written on the advertisement. I was really shocked. Because from my point of view the buildings of a play are the actors. It was unpleasent for me to see different actors on the stage. In addition, you didn't keep your promise which   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Beatrice was 18 and she could manage. But her father didn't have the same opinion. That's all I knew about her. Days passed. Beatrice and Pat were going everywhere together. Pat had a boyfriend. That's why Beatrice's father never liked Pat. One day Beatrice came  me with some tears on her face. She was crying. I couldn't believe .

I want if it is possible a log cabins like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood, therefore I need a confortable accommodation.

Otherwise, could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for the food, please? Yours sincerely. Xavier Fournier  [SEP]  How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping? Sometimes, they are happy to do shopping. but why? Therefore, shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case. Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone. In fact you try to get a present to make  receive happy. Shopping is also good, when you know what you want. For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops. In the opposite, shopping can be disenjoyable. Shopping is boring if you go with people  too fussy. That is to say, they are never happy with what they get and see. They always find a problem. Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops. It is stupid, they do not have any goal. They waste their time. To conclude, I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Even if I like to do shopping with some people and  kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time. ",26.0
69," Dear Miss Clark, I have recently taken part in your International Arts Festival. I enjoyied it and here are some feelings and advice for next year. First of all, it was a great idea to put together different countries to organise this Festival. However, there were only artists from six countries, not  as written in your add. Then I had  pleasure  listening to your variety of concerts. Each one was fantastic and fill in with euration, but I'd appreciate more place, because unfortunately some concert halls were too small! You certainly saw that  plays and films had a lot of success. So, I wanted to know if there will be more films next year. It could be an advantage! An other excellent thing was your choice for the entry. That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events. That was simpler than an other way of selling tickets (practical and attractive). Finally, I want you to make a suggestion for next year. It would be better if people have had the possibility to let their cars very near to the Festival during the week-end! I am sure you'll pay attention to my suggestions and advice and I am looking forward to seeing you next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps. So, her father prepared the car and her mother took some food for the journey. That was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited. He was very keen on going in the mountains. Suddenly, the father stopped and said: ""Here we are!"" They were near a little house, built in wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family. They ate with the owner of the little house, whose name was John. It was very quiet because they were in  nature; they could just hear  cows and John's two dogs. Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects in wood. After that, marks father who had fluent traditional Swiss language spent time with an old woman he had just met near the house. After eating old cheese and Swiss chocolate, that was high time Mark's family went back home. Mark was such happy but very exhausted to recognize this story nevertheless this story happened a long time ago. ",27.00
601," 13 June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan: I am very glad I won the Competition to go to Camp California. I must say though, I would have to travel on July because it's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friend if it is possible. Log cabines will be  ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at . Climbing would be my second option,  for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times. I would like to know how much money do people ussually take and how many clothes. Sincerely Yours  [SEP]  13 July Dear Kim: Well, you want to know what I did in the concert? Help.. I know it sound extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprise it turned out to be much more fun that expected. About 20 people were helping apart from me, we had some kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert. Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert. It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs! It was so fun, that I enjoyed it a lot. If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me, I'm in!!! Write back soon ",36.0
808," Dear Helen Ryan, the competition Organiser, I have recently recieved your letter  that I have won the first prize in the competition. It was very fortuanate of me. I would like to go to Camp California in the USA only in July as it is my summer holidays . It will be convenient for me then because I have two months holiday. I would like to do Tennis and Photography. I am in the team for tennis at school and I have played against different other schools before. I also enjoy photography. I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E. so it would be very helpful for me to practise. About the accommodation at the Camp, I would like to stay in tents because I love to be outside and I like dangerous adventures. I can also then wake up in the morning and take photographs of the wonderful sceneries. I would like to ask you about what kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I have bring. Will there be any shops? Please could you send me an itenerary of the trip? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends which normally is the only appropreaite time! Not only shops are crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queue. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side of 'shopping'. I, personally enjoy shopping very much. I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them. I find that shopping is a very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath. I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future, there will be no more crowded streets because of the 'internet'  which you can order onlines. Maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future! We all just have to wait and see... ",29.0
1203," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about  international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed. The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite to the hotel) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it. There is a party on the last day of the conference. Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best. Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music, dancing and fun are provided. Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11pm. You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party. Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about  free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to  for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone, a car, a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us (or we have got used) as we use them every day. Hundred years before people couldn't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer. They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so. Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them. First of all they say about  enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others . But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then. I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone  doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention  hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life. Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an automobile transport is  undenyable neccecerity in our life. In case of all  said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel's inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages. ",24.00
1012," Dear Mr Robertson. Thank you very much for taking us to London. This is a big opportunity to discover the capital. Thoug, a few of us would like to consider the ""London fashion and leisure show"". This is going to take place on tuesday march 14 at 10.00 to 19.00. Could you, if we may ask so, re-organise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping center. However, none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in  forecast. Perhaps, we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shop center. This is a very important stay over three days. Every one hopes to enjoying himself and comes back with a lot of knowledge. I thank you very much for hearing my request. I apologise for any inconvenience it could make. I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to ""the London fashion and leisure show"". On behalf of all the students. Yours truly.  [SEP]  What do famous people wish? Do they want to be famous and ignored? Or do they want to be persecuted buy the media? There are plenty of good things about being famous. You do not have a precarious life. You are rich and be-loved. Of course, it does not mean you deserve to be persecuted all the time. Perhaps we could call it the ""rough of the smooth"". However, to have his photos taken and showed on television and   newspapers increases your popularity. It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame. I might also miss the point. You might be a Princess, a politician or a footballer; but are not doing it for any fame. You were born with the talent, sometime with the title. You never wished to be famous that much. Whateaver you do, the journalist should not follow you every second. Every one deserves to be given the right of a private life. ",27.00
45," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about  International Arts Festival which I went to recently. I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual. I think that  International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price. In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about. Firstly, there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year. Therefore, there will be more people coming  the concerts. Finally, food shops should be added in this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences. I would be grateful if you could consider my opinion above, Yours sencirely,  [SEP]  Dear Karrie, Hello. How are you doing? I've been also considering rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out wheneve I want, even in the mid-night. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home. There is a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite  unusual rule in  Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't  make up on at school at all. I want to at least put lip coluor on. I wish I could change this rule. I'll be grade if you let me know about your rules at school and at home. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes. ",26.00
480," Dear Sir, I am from Brazil and I recently expent a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement of a musical show being held at The Circle Theatre. As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the play. As I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not avaible. Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good. So I sitted in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, that is an unacceptable delay. Even though I was still excited about the show, but then I sudently realise that Danny Brook is not performing, he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor. The night had been terrible, but it could be saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it been closed because the heater was not working due to  leaking. As you can see it was not the perfect evening out your advertisement talked about. Then, I would be glad if you could have  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily lief. Modern technology has brought  many discoveries which have made our daily lives much easier. For example,  internet has given us the possibility of acessing reliable information very fast. I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what happens to me. When I was younger I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine. But technology is not just about studying, it is entertainment too! I can watch pay-per-view films without having to go out to rent one. I can also listen to cds, play the latest games, watching concerts.. everything in a zap. You also have fast food, or food made in the microwave within a few minutes. As you can see, technology is about saving our time, so we may have more time to do what we like. In my opinion, technology is making my life much better because of that. ",32.0

672," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter asking for further information from me. First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes. Besides, I would preffer to stay in  tents, because I got used to being in tents since each summer I spent my holidays with my friends at the hills. In adittion, I would rather playing tennis. When I was younger I won the National Tennis Championship. I also like surfing, I think it is a dangerous sport, but I know how to practice it, because of the fact that last year a proffessional surfer tought me. However, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take and if it is possible for you to tell me how much money I will need. I would appreciate it if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special good you never find it. Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products, that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else. I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that it really become tiring. To summarize, I could say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then, go shopping. If not shopping  never be enjoyable, but also tiring and boring.

776," Dir Madam I'm writing to you in reply to your letter. I was really suprised when I opened it. I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me on August and I will have to look after them. I prefer staying in tens to staying in log cabins. Because it remainds me  my childhood. I used to going with my friends to the camp, wich was situeded on a seaside. We had always enjoying ourselves. Never had I got such a great time. From your's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing. I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport. I find it very atractive. I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old. However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport. For me it is only a hobby. Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport. I would like to ask what kinds of clothes should I take with me. and I wonder if prizes are high there. Yours faithfully Angelina  [SEP]  I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want. It isn't true. Nowdays we have many big shopping centers. We like them because everything is on one place. The most suitable time for shopping is  weekand when parents don't work and children haven't got a school. Because of that shopping centers are over crowded. You can't buy something in  peacful and calm athmospher. In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high, of course not all of them. However such centers are very useful and necessary. I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is  extremly hugh queu to the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable. If you bought something goregous, you would be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have  bad mood don't go shopping. ",26.0
852," Dear Ms Ryan I'm writing to reply to your questions about Camp California. First of all, thank you very much for giving me such a good opportunity. I'm very pleased and I'd like to go to the States as soon as possible, however I'm free only in July. Currently I'm studying in England and the school finishes at the end of June. After that I will go back to Japan and continue studying at College, but it stats at the beginning of August. As for the accommodation I would prefer log cabins. I'm not a kind of person who can easily fall a sleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent. At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf. I belonged to a climbing club at my highschool and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practicing centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent of golf. Lastly I'd like to ask you some questions. That is how many and what sort of clothes I need and how much money I should bring. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I think we should follow our time table if we make a video about daily school life, but we cannot film every lessons so I picked up some interesting ones. Firstly we should defnitely put the news review lesson , because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion. Secondly I think the FCE class should be filmed. Most of us (students) came to our school because they wanted to study English, so it should be the important part. In addition if we film the class, people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is. Then why don't we film our lunch time because it is also important, isn't it? I think we should film it at the very crowded moment so that people can see we have to wait patiently before we reach our foods. I think nextly we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class. For the very last part why not filming our faces when all the lessons are finished? ",38.0
773," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you about the first prize I won in your competition. I am very pleased and I include the information you asked for. I prefer travelling in July because I am taking some important exams in September and I have planned to study in August. With reference to the accomodation I would rather stay in  tent because I think it is the best way to socialize. For what concernes the activities I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me. I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses. On the other hand I have never had a course of climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby. I would like to ask you something about the weather and clothes I should bring  not to have to buy anything there. In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not in the accomodation so that I could decide how much I must have with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Mafalda D'Accatino  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I bet you want to know everything about my great experience at Luna Pop's concert last month. Before that I had never thought I would play with a famous group. But maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning. As you know Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.  In that moment Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun  but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune. I think you can't believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience. This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed staying on the stage with all those eyes on me. I wish you had been with me but I'm sure you understand what I felt. Love Mafalda ",35.0
448," Dear Sir, I'm writting to complain about your theatre and its last night show. Firstly I would lice to say that I am very dissappointed with the show and that I didn't have the perfect evening out, as you had advertised. I have no idea from where to start. The main character of the musical show, which I'd like to say wasn't the ""BEST"", was awfull. His act was not good and he didn't seem like acting Even my son could act better. After the horrible act of your star, it comes the starting ours. I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I didn't. Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef and the waiters where on holiday. You could hire other  to do the work. I was very dissappointed what else can I write. It was suppose to be my perfect everning out. But it wasn't. I will ask  my money back. In Conclusion I'd like to recoment that you should, first, know what you have to offer and the advertising it. Yours sensirly Helena.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I shouldn't have told her that my dad had physcological problems. I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell it to my brother. It all started when I was about 10 years old, like my brother  now, and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems, to my aunt. I was hurt inside and cried till my tears run dry. I couldn't accept it. All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend. I was leaving in a lie. Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake  to say, this problem to my ""friend"" Pat. I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot, so I never thought that things could turn  like this. When, one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about the subject of my father and his problems. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was realy going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He stand outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised it, it was too late. The secret was revilied. And now I try to help my brother beaus I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels. ",28.0

I would prefer to stay in  tents rather than in  log cabins, because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming. I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me.

I want to thank you for this prize, let me know if you need further information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Bianca Botticelli  [SEP]  Dear Kim, In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working in a concert was great. You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart from the musicists and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets,  the number on them and taking the people to their seats. It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they didn't want to wait for my help; so they went around the theatre, looking for their seats and making so much noise. Sometimes I think that people never grow up, if they had been a class of children, they would have made less noise!! Anyway, it was a great experience in spite of these little problems. Now I have to go, write soon and let me know what you have been doing. Lots of love Bianca xxx ",36.0
1235," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you. You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is  ; once you have gone out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just by our college. When you are in the college ask for me. The conference will take one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start, it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff. The dress code is: no jeans. We will prove you with food and drinks. For your free hours I have quite a few ideas. There are lots of things to do here. We have got a museum which is just at two minutes from your hotel. You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café. If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that. I hope this information will be helpful. If you have any other questions, please, do contact me. Looking forward to seeing you soon. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  THE MOBILE PHONE The mobile phone has completely changed our lives, it is an instrument which I cannot imagine myself living without. Apart from being in-fashion it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it? Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone. I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone. Five years ago you wouldn't have even thought about it. It has been a plus for me. For example, now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me, and, sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with. All over, the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone. ",38.00
336," Dear sir, I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that was place last evening. None of  conditions was fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed by another actor. As a result it was a disappointing performance. Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30. On the other hand, it there wasn't any discounts in the sell of the tickets. To make matters worse, when the show finished we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because of the fact that it was closed (since it was being painted). I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all  promises that appeared in the advertisment. Of course, what it was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and I would  very greatful if you  refund me a compensation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? I imagine it will be very different. Sciencist will invented new materials that will keep the  temperature in a suitable range. In that way people won't feel cold or hot, they will be always at the same temperature. In addition these new material won't weight hardly anything. As well, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowaday, however it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport or everything you have to do. For that reason clothes will be simplier and more practise. Besides, everybody will be able to afford to buy  then that's why the prize of this sort of material will be very available. Of course, the resources used and  manufacturing  will be completely harmless for the enviroment because people will be more aware of the neccesity of taking care of the world we live in. ",31.0
750," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month. First of all, I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school's activities so my parents just let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes. About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been practicing it during 5 years so I want to keep on it. The other activity that I chose is painting, I am not as well as I want, nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course. I would rather   tends than  log cabins for  accommodation because the last summer I had the great opportunity to be in a log cabin and now I want to know  the other one . I am sure it will be thrilling to stay near the nature and at the same time, it would be a new experience for me. I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me  appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know, is the amount of money that I have to bring with me. If you need more information, please do not hesitate on writing  me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: John Weller. From: Raquel Rossell. Re: Suggestions for the film. Introduction To make easier and faster this report , it was necessary to make a questionarie which was gave out in the school. After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results: 1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the listening room room and the library because as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places  helping them to improve their English on their own. 2 - They also think, that  filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes. 3 - The least but not the last, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activities organised by the social programme, has became really exciting, so they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those that did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying  and they mentioned it as not really important. Conclusion As you can see, my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have. Despite of being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar. I do recommend to pay attention to the food in the cafeteria because even though it was not the main reason of this report, they also wrote complaning about that. If you need more information and the sheets that I collected, please do not hesitate on asking me for them. ",29.0
1225," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am glad to help you for the organisation of the conference. I phoned to the tourist information  last week and I got some information about the accomodation of the students. I think we should book at the Palace Hotel. It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre. The Hotel is in a good position, 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is on foot. I am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town. The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm. I think they should wear smart dress, because there will be lots of interesting people and  important meeting. In conclusion, for the last day, I thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art. On the other hand, if you prefer to have a relaxing day, you could have a pic-nic in the wonderful park. I hope my suggestion and Idea will help you to organise the meeting. I look forward to receiving your confirmation. Yours,  [SEP]  REPORT: TO: MR FROM: DATE: 21ST JUNE 2000 INTRODUCTION: As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility for a group of American students for the visit at the Etruscan Museum. GENERAL INFORMATION: The museum is situated in the centre of Populoniou, the picturesque fishing village on the Etruscan Coast. Populoniou is about 15 Km. from Piombino and it can be reached by  well-organised means of transport. DESCRIPTION: The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive building in my town. It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains about  Etruscans neoropolis. The entrance fee is £7  each student. POSITIVE ASPECTS 1. The Museum is well-organised for tourists. There are some shops,  café and toilets. Also there are some free handphones, that explain the history of the museum. 2. After their visit into the Museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the tuscan Archipelago, and they could have a pic-nic on the beach. NEGATIVE ASPECTS 1. The negative aspect of the museum is that  is quite expensive for students.

330,"  Dear manager, I am writing to tell you that I stayed very disappointed with the theatre. One of my reasons  to travel to London, was this theatre. I knew that ""Over the rainbow"" was horrible! I thought that it was the best musical show that London had. I was wrong, very wrong. In the propaganda  had written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are supposed to be the actors, and in the theatre  had totally differents actors. I bought my tickets fuee days before the theatre thinking I will have  discounts. But it happenned the opposite. I payed the same as  who bought the tickets ten minutes before the theatre. Other thing I have to complement is about the time of the theatre. It was supposed to starts at half past seven, and it started only at fifteen  past eight. After all this, I want to know if I will have some money back. I hope so. yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It is true that science and technology affects our lives a lot. The technology is essencial to our life, we need it on each minute, on each second. It is rare the schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use. But it is good and bad in the same time. Good because you can have acess to a lot of informations, and it is bad because the computers are getting the people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who have the certain  that the computers will not get the place of the teachers? It is interesting to starts to think about this point. Another point is that the television is taking the childhood of the children. For example, our parents had time to played with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only shows silly programmes. We need this technology, but we have to know how to control this. ",24.0
142," Dear Manager, I wright to complein about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I had a very disapointing evening because of many things. First the actor was a wery common actor. then it start's 45 minutes lent. Also in the advicement they talk about discount tikets. Well they didn't accepted when I pay with my £20 discount tiket why? And at last I couldn't visit the theater restaurant after the show, it was closed, why? I don't know. Alslo I wanted to tell you that the show was very borring. It was alwais the saim. And it was to slow. Because  all these things it obiously wasn't the perfect evening as it's seid in the advicement. So I wrought this letter to ask for my money back. Your's faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because after I told her that I have a new girlfriend, all the school knows it in lees than 2 hours. I have to explain to every body that, I formaly dond't have a girlfriend, I explein  them that it's was a good posibility, nothing els, but noone belive me, because Pat has told them that I have a formal girlfriend. This problem with Pat had a lot of consecuences, because I had a very hevy discucion with her about that, it was so heay that one of ower teachers had to calm me , because I was very angree with her. The teacher send me to talk with the principal, who suspended me for discus in bad maners with a girl. So I was suspended, I had a fight with one of my best friend, all because she wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",18.0
213," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to complain about my unpleasant experience of visiting your theatre on May 21st. I had dreamt about visiting the Circle Theatre to see Danny Brook's performance for a long time. As soon as I saw your advertisement in the 'Tourist Guide' issue 46, I decided to go at once. However, all my expectations failed to become true. First of all, I found that no discounts for tickets were available. Although you mentioned it in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the starting they announced that Danny Brook woud not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor. After the show I was not surpised at all to know that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration. As a whole, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get. In connection with that I ask you to refund the money I paid for my tickets. I really hope it will not take you long to settle the matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Undoubtfully, modern technology changed my daily life. And the best word I can  describe all the changes with is ""drastical"". Every aspect of my life is being constantly influence by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc. Among the greatest inventions of man I came accross dayly are  telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of a day I may contact any person at any part of the world over  phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousand  kilometres'  from me. Computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet, to make shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. Automobile saves my time when I'm travelling. All the above and many other achievements of modern technology make my life more convenient, comfortable, effective and fun. But it is not the end. Scientists continue researches into new technologies, such as lasers, digital technology,  gene engineering. And I'm sure all those will set new better standards for my way of living. ",28.0

1164," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference to your last letter concerning the international student conference in our college. I would get you the information you are requested. First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as usually, we would organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wear a suit (for  man) or a skirt (for  woman). Furthermore, this party would be in your hotel like  the following years. Finally, there are a lot of mouseum is our town, therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum which is really fashinating. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  from: for: the group leader. subject: Arboriginal Art Museum. The aim of this report is intended to discribe the biggest building of our town. I am in a position to choose a good building which students like myself are interested in. a) this museum presents more than 200000 original art pictures. b) The building has been buit in 1999, therefore, it is a modern architecture. c) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tour in Paris. d) This building is included: 30 toilets, 500'000 lights, and also 100 people whom can help you if you need any information. I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the eldest civilisation of the world in one of the modernest building. ",26.00
487," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complaint about the show 'Over the Rainbow'. During my stay in London I went to your theatre to see this show. As it is said in your advertisement, the show is starring Danny Brook but there was  different actor . It is not the only problem. The show had to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. You promised that there will be discounts, but when I came, I found out, that they were not available. I wanted to go to your restaurant. I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we will go there. And what I found out. Your restaurant was closed. You promised that if we go to your show we will have a perfect evening. Everything was just vice versa. I am very disappointed, that is why I am asking you for compensation. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. It happened at the end of  school year. My class was going to a night disco and I wanted to go there too. I asked my parents if I could go, but they did not let me do that. I tried to persuade them, told that nothing will happen to me, promised to do all  housework. But all they have done is told me that I am to young for it and I can go there only when I am 20 years old. I had such a desire to go to the disco, that I decided to go even without  parent's permission. I told my secret to my best friend Pat. But she told it to very kid in school, even the teachers heard it. It occured that one of the teachers told my parents about it. At the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks. I understood that I must keep my secrets and do not tell anybody, even the best friend. ",28.0
609," Dear Sir or Madam Thank you for the letter. It was great to hear from you. I was surprised that I have won. By the way, I would like to travel in July, because just I have free time in July. Moreover, I am keen on in summer. As can be seen from your letter, I can choose Accommodation. I would prefer to stay in tents. One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel wild life more than  I stay in log cabins. According to your letter, there are 10 main activities which I can choose 2 and play while I am on the holiday. I would like to play Basketball and Golf. Both of them I am not as good as you expect, but recently I have been intrested in those. Finally, I would like to ask some question such as  clothes and money. What kind of clothes are much to the camp? Furthermore this is  first time I have been to abroad therefore I don't know how much money I should bring. I am looking forward to hearing from you yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear kim How have you been doing recently. I have been busy anyway. I want to tell you how much I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was  begining of this summer. One of my friends suggested that we should have had  part time job which was that. Both of us are keen on pop music. Although at first I didn't wand to do it, because it was in summer. It must have been hot. Howeve, we decided to have the job, because of good money. Howeve it was  great job I haven't hade such  experience . I could see a great number of pop stars in front of us. Can you believe that. My job just prepear drink for them. Moreover one of  famous stars gave me a sign. I will never forget at that time. I must sign off as I want to catch the post. Could you being in touch and send back a letter. A big hug from me ",26.0
397," Dear Sir Last week I attempted the musical ""Over the rainbow"", and I am writting in order to complaint about things that really disappointed me. First of all, I want to say that in the play  appeared a different actor  despite  that in the advertisement appeared the name of Danny Brook, that actor was very bad. Another thing I want to add is that the musical started 45 minutes late, it was planned to start at 19.30 and it really did it at 20:15. During this time we had to keep seating in the theatre and it was boring and tiring. Thirdly, when I bought the tickets, I asked for discounts and nobody know anything about them, so it is false  there are discounts available. However, we enjoyed the musical, but while going out to have dinner, we saw the restaurant  closed and we had to take the car and come back home very hungry. It was a very disappointing evening and I hope you will give us some money back. I am waiting for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writting for the article about clothes in the future. In my oppinion, in a hundred of years, we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change in clothes, will be the comfortability of them and the way they protect us and our body from temperature and physical agressions. I think they will cold us in the summer and makes us hot in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater with a high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will take  part in clothes development, scientists will search the way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I wish I win the trip! ",25.0
209," Dear MANANGER of the theatre I'm writing just for the reason, to inform you how bad became the present , name ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". First of all in the describing of the show, the starring sould be Mr. DANNY BROOK, and it wasn't. Another thing was the started time , the show started forty five minutes late. So try to imagine my situation, I had paied a lot of money and I couldn't saw a good show, I am really disappointed. When the play ""over the Rainbow"" finished I tried to eat something, but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed, because your personal were cleaning all the troubles that a old dog did. But, the principal reason of this letter is to ask for some money back. I think that could be the best for everyone, and I'll like to give you an advice, if somebody pay you for a ticket, try to give the best you can. Hope hearing from you.  [SEP]  Unfortunatety, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, I'm going to tell  about my grandfather and his friend Pat: Many years ago, more or less seventy years  a young man with a exellent capacity of thinking and to invent materials things, started building a big thing called  ""time machine"". He worked day and night. Every day after having dinner Pat, his best friend, and my grandpa met to talk about their problems, but my Grandpa never told Pat about his new project. One month later, his worked was complete, but he was afraid of testing his machine, so he called Pat and spoke   about it. The only thing Pat should do, was to choose a date, the one he likes and to press the starter botton, and you know, what, he did it! The machine worked really good. The fact was that Pat choose to go to the year 2000, and when he arrived, he told every one that he was the inventor. That's why Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. THE END. ",25.0
399," The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show ""Over the Rainbow,""  I attended to, a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset  when I realized that the  expected famous actor Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy; this entertainment did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. More over, I was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing  as, indicated on your adverts, but I, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it  happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. ""A Perfect evening out""!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque of £15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had made my own experience with her so far and I would be always careful not to tell her anything important when ever we met. As, Pat had recently made a new friend with Olga, my sister, I warned my sibling about Pat's failing: ""Don't ever rely on Pat for keeping a secret, Sweet-Heart; she just can't""! Mind what you may tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping around is her favorite leisure activity! However, I guess that Olga turned a deaf hear to what I had told her. This is the impression I got. A couple of weeks later, my sister called me as I was at work; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears, she could, hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then, feel her, upset as ever. I could get her as well simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably: - ""Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat"", hurled Olga  at me, through the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the ""poor cow""! ",31.0
629," Dear Helen Ryan, It was grateful for your message. I can gladly give you some information which you need. I would be able to travel only in July because I have a job at the moment, but it will be my vacation in July. I would prefer to be in tents, so that I could enjoy a nature life more than being  log cabins. Moreover, it would be more exciting for me. It could be nice for doing two activities while I am at the Camp. I am interested in sports. Especially, I am wonderful at swimming. I have swimmed since I was in primary school. I would like to learn playing golf at the Camp. I have never played golf in my life. Is it possible to learn playing golf, although I am not good at golf? Would you mind giving some answer  whether I need some clothes and money at the Camp? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry that I haven't written to you for a long time. It was nice you wanted to hear about my experience, and I know you're looking for a job which I did. It was a wonderful chance for me. As you know, I love music. Before the concert started, I cleaned the stage for  singers and I gave some drinks to  singers. Finally, I cleaned the stage again. My works were for  singers, so I could meet singers and talk together. Do you know ""Radio Head""? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some signatures of them. It's brilliant, isn't it? Especially, I liked cleaning the stage, because I could stand  a famouse singer's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm, even though I had to clean it. I want to hear about your school life, and your part-time job. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",24.0
143," Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook, starring  all the scenes. Instead, you changed  actor without any warning, so I didn't find my favourite Danny Brook, with my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would have a right on it. At the top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the troubles you caused me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Most people think modern technologies aren't so positive as they are often showed . My personal theory is completely different. I have always a good approach with all of the most recent invenctions or any other kind of modern applications. We live in the age of personal computers, of  internet, of the mobile phones, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It' already four years since I bought my first cellular phone ( then I changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend and to my family than before. Anyway, the thing that has most changed my daily life is the personal computer and, expecially,  internet. For example, now I'm writing my thesis, but I use my pc everytime I have to write a document in a perfect form. Then, surfing in  internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic! ",30.0

The conference day our school driver is going to pick you up in the hotel and take you to the conference. The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking.

Finally,  the last day I sugget you to go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to recomend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Musseum. This is an historical building. I asked to some pleople in town and this was the best place to choose. History The Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was build at the time when the Spanish people was trying to take all the lands from Mexico, one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez, the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time. Place The Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco. Is situated in the top of a little mountain in the ""old"" part on the city. You are able to get there by car or walking and see everything which was made at that time. Conclusion On the whole this is the best building in Acapulco for his history and reputation. Is the best place to go and   easy to get there. ",29.00

Everytime I travel around, I sleep in nice rooms with nice beds; that is why I think it is a good option to sleep in sleep-bags. From the activities I can choose to do in these two weeks, I would enjoy playing basketball and climbing. I think it would be funny to play basketball after  five years; and since I go out to the mountains once a month, I don't think I would have any problem with climbing. I would like to ask you some questions: Could you tell me what kind of clothes would be addecuate for these two weeks? How much money do you think I should bring with me?

As I told you in my last letter, I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert. The pop group were all young people (between 23 - 30 years old), and all of them were really nice. Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people), consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,... The job was hard, but from my point of view, it was worthful. I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun. Every five working hours, we had thirty-minutes break to eat something. We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons. The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day . That was fantactic! If you have never been there, I enormous recemmend you to go. Even I played the drums there! I hope your exams are doing well, and you write me back when you finish them. Lots of love ",30.0

I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel on July. I can't change anymore the date of umployment because I signed the contract a month ago: I hope it will not make problems to you. For accomodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin, it would be better to let money or anything  without thinking of theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I never have the opportunity to discover this sport. When I saw  you propose this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've done sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I was  sailing teacher on summers the past few years. Does Camp California provide all  clothes for sailing? Do I need to bring  money from Home? Or can I retire some at Camp California? Thank you very much. G Morin  [SEP]  Life at school is made of several things. first, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us . But there are also a lots of clubs and activities that take part in the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make. The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real, concrete. for example, the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting. And especially the practical work. It would be great if we show it in our film, it might be also very interesting to watch it. For other activities, we could probably show a training one of our sport team. For example the team basketball which has won the student regional tittle (we can also say it) or the team of football. After all, it is not important the one we will show. but I think we must give a good picture of the school with sport. ",26.0

In addition, I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being near nature and especially singing birds. Thus, I enjoy sports and I would like to practice swimming and climbing. I am not too bad at these sports. To conclude, will you kindly let my know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me.

On one hand, we should be interested in the lessons. At first, the research and design courses are exiting since we are studying how cars are built. Secondly, we should interview the teacher of heat transfert since his courses are rally breathtaking. That seems to be quite surprising, yet this teacher manages to convey his knowledge. On the other hand, we should be interested in the other activities such as sports wich could appeal  more students in our school. For example, our basketball team has won a local championship. To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to make come out the best of ourselves. ",27.0
125," Lausanne, the 20th of May 2000 Dear M. Smith, My name is Marie Bouchard, I come from Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend. On Thursday, the 3rd of May 2000, we went to your theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"". Unfortunately, we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre. Firstly, we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts as it's written on your advertisement . Surprisily, there were no discounds. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!! Thirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement? In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!! Nothing was serious. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful. I sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back. In advance, thank you. I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre. Sincerely yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When her best friend, Scala, asked her  an idea to surprise her husband  because she's pregnant, Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala's husband got the surprise. The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village. She's a secretary in an office. Everybody knows everybody. Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husband  too. It was a Friday suny afternoon, Scala was really excited  to tell her the new. Despite  she knew that Pat couldn't keep  secret but for this time she was confident  maybe too. Just after Scala told her the new, Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery, to tell  that Scala is pregnant. As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came & bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said ""Congratulations for the new baby."" He was so amazed and asked  to repeat . She just thought it would be a secret,  she came really embarassed. When he went back to his house, his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it wasn't a surprise! Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret. ",25.0
134," Olivier Peissaud The Manager Circle Theater Dear Sir, I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London. My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay  the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait  8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I. After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the ""perfect evening"" as written in the adverstiment. So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy  - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Your children clothes in 100 years How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years,  clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too. So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see. I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as ""baggy"", or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that . Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view. To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy. ",36.0
970," Dear Competition Organiser, I am writing to replay  your letter and to ask  more details about the competition. Firstly, I would like to say that I'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition. As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays on July. Is it suitable for you? As you mentioned about the accomodation, I would prefer stay in the tents, because it's more exciting and I really love camping. I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good in almost  of this activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it's misteries and I also like the watter, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I'm tall and very fast with the ball. Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed  to pay for food and things like that. I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay. sincerely Clara  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to tell you some news and to ask a little bit about you. First of all, I'm going to tell the good news. Last month, I went to a pop concert with four bands . It was unbelivebly!!! Although it was 5.000 thousand people there, people could walk and dance without any problem. It was very well organised, the shows started in the exactly  time and the group were well performed too. I have contributed to the concert  selling some tickets to my friends. However  the success of the concert, at the end of  show some full gays started a big confusion and some people get hurt. It was depressing... Finally, I would like to know some news about you, What have you done? Be you studing a lot? Please write me a letter as soon as possible! Love from Clara. ",28.0
176," Dear Sir As I thought your advertisement was interesting, I went there but it was not  good as it should be. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook as you wrote. Secondly, it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30. According to the advertisement, the discounts were available. In fact, I had to pay the full price which costed me £15. After the show I intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because as you have known that the show started late, therefore the restaurant had closed before the show finished. As I have informed you  all the fact, I think the show was not worth the money I paid, so I want the refund for £15. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The story begins when Jan, who was Pat's best friend, told Pat that she saw Tim when he was cheating  the exam. The next day, Pat told everybody what she had heard from Jan, so when the news came to  teachers' ears, the teachers decided to give Tim  grade F in that subject and tell his parents!! Tim, who was the most powerful bully, was punished by his parents and of course by the teachers. He was furious with Jan, so what happened was Jan was bullied but not because of her fault, it was Pat's. Actually, I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat's way. It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim would haven't known who had told the teachers. Now, Jan has still been bullied nearly everyday. Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thier child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story. If all of us try to help her, I'm sure that we can make her a better school life. ",28.0
354," SOLES LEDIA CI HACIA DE LOREDES MADRID THE CIRCLE THEATRE LONDON Dear Sir, I am writing  you to complain about the musical show which took place the last 1st of May in ""the Circle Theatre"" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous, I was surprised of its facade and also I was anxious for the beginning of the performance. My friends and me thought that it would be the perfect night  in London but everything changed when the show had been delayed more than forty-five minutes. Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward for that marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed  us were not the same as the  theatre, we asked for our special discount for be students with less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rudely answer of the woman who sold the tickets. In addition to this, we realized when the show began that the main character was not Danny Brook. At top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat on the theatre. You can imagine how upset we were and we asked you for our  reward for the night that we spent . Yours Faithful  [SEP]  Nowadays we think in the modern technology as something usual in our lives. For instances with the arrive of  Internet, the new digital television or the researchers in the medecin; we are discovering how we can change our lives only with  press  a botton, or look for something new with only think about it... we realize that the new technology it have just begun , and  lively in a few years we will be very avanced in this way. In my point of view the new techincs have more advantages than disadvantages, my reasons for saying that is because furthermore we can live better, we can also have more ways of know now to live healthy and how to spent our free time. Although the technology also is used for create new types of weapons and also for killing people, it is only the worst part of this. But however it is a good idea to spend out money in make new enterprises which pay the researchers and they could investigate how  to improve ourselves. ",25.0
595," 18 June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I have just received it yesterday. I am very exciting. I would like to go to California in the U.S.A. in July. It is the only month that I can have my holiday in a year and it would be nice in the summer time. About the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin. It would be nice and safe for me than the tents. The activities I would like to choose the swimming and sailing. It could be fun for me because I like swimming and sailing could be exciting too. Lastly, I would like to know about the money and clothes. How about the weather in California in July? Is it hot or raining? Then I can prepare my clothes, or can we buy some clothes there? Are they accept the credit card or only cash. I don't want to take money with me. I would be greatful if you could send me the full details. Many thanks. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the following paragraps I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages about shopping. Everyone needs to shopping everyday. It is  very important thing for our life. We need food, clothes, book etc. There are many kinds of thing for shopping and they are different for example the price, the quality In  suppermarket, shop, department store  have many things. We could buy mostly all we need in one store. It is very convenien. On the other hand, shopping is not always easy. Sometime, it's so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are  hurry while you are in the long queu. We have seen then,  shopping is very important for our life. Most people enjoy shopping because it  more convenien for today but if you found the busy place for shopping or it is not as good as you expect. It would not  enjoyable for you. ",21.0
569," 13th June 2000 Dear Sir, I have just receised your letter and I thanck you for your invitation and congratulations. I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction for your perfect organisation. About the information requested from me I have to say that I can travel only  July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June. As regards accomodation, I prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting. My favourite sports-activities are playing tennis and basketball. I like competitive and changelling sports, I enjoy myself comparing my skill with other players and, if possible, I  rather practising sports-activities not indoor, but open air . I would like to know if special clothes are needed and how the weather is in this period like. The one last thing that I would like to know is if I have to bring with me money for expenses not included in your invitation. Let me know this information as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Ramona  [SEP]   13 June 2000 I have been asked to write a report about the lessons and other activities that should be filmed to make a short video. I have given a questionnaire to other students of my class to know their preferences about this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is Philosophy. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the sports-activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the atletics-school games. Also the dancing lessons should be filmed, specially for the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments. I hope that these my suggestions can be accepted and appreciated.

740," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me  some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend to a 'Development & Research Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as a assistant from the beginning of Aguest. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have ever slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in  tent. Whole night, I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. Especially I love water-painting. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be  fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't swimming at all. I'm afraid of water. That  why I couldn't have swimmed yet. I think this chance is  very good for me to learn to swim. I expect to join  above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'll buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into the every shops. I always want to buy T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, cosmetic, hairband, accessories, ring, earings, bracelet, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationeries, interior stuffs and CD. But it is impossible to buy everything at the same time. I have to chose some of them and I have to give up buying most of them. Before I go out home, I make a plan. What  is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items. But when I stand at every shops, I can't stand my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something what I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be  very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think  why I'm so poor. But I can get over . I go window shopping. Insead of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try every  shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jakect on. They are mine! Shopping is not always enjoyable. But if you think positive opinion about shopping, It will make you the happiest and the riches man in the world. ",26.0
673," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in which you communicate  I have won first prize in your competion. I am glad. Thank you very much. Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know  further information about travel and accomodation. I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at University and at the moment I do not know the exact date. I can tell you I am only free in July. I would prefer an accomodation in  log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent. As regard as the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to practise painting and photography. I am a painter in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes, people, animals. I like also taking photographs, for example during my journeys or trips. So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting. Would you give me some information about  clothes to wear there? I would like also to know how much money I can bring. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Billy Esposito  [SEP]  There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' and who is happy only when  can go shopping. In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty. If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch, doing shopping is a terrible activity. On the other hand if you can walk  without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable. For istance, it is funny enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt although you do not buy anything. To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not. I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends. In my opinion, shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday. ",29.0
953," Dear Miss/Mrs. Ryan, I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need. Firstly, I can only travel in July, as it is then when I get my holiday from my present job. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, because when I was a child I used to go to a campsite and stay in a tent with my family for two weeks every summer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. About the activities I can choose from, I would be delighted if I could sing, because it is something that I have always loved and, although perhaps I should not say that myself, I think I have a nice voice. I am also very fond of photography, so when I have seen that it is among your options it has been a wonderful surprise. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp, the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves. I am looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks very much for your last letter. Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month, I'll tell you something: it was fantastic. I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt  the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it. When we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat. But the most amazing thing happened later, when ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always keep it like a treasure. I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, O.K? Till then, take care  yourself. Love, ",36.0
1168," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give some information on the conference as you required. First of all, your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is very convenient to stay  and has  beautiful landscape. I would recommend you get to the conference by subway, because  subway station is situated in 5 minutes' walk from the hotel. It will take you about 15 minutes to arrive at the college. There will be a party after the conference. We will serve you dinner and some college students are going to sing, play musical instruments and so on, but you can join  if you wish. Therefore, you had better wear casual and comfortable clothes. Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on. You will be able to buy them in   reasonable price. I hope you will enjoy your stay in my country. I look forward to meeting all of you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Amusement Centre Introduction The aim of this report is to give information on the Amusement Centre in Seoul. It is based on my experience and on views expressed by local people who were interviewed. Facilities It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself. There is a wide range of facilities including theatres, game centres, Korean restaurants. In particular, the people seemed to be satisfied with  theatres, because the screen is massive. The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular to foreigners. Things to buy It seemed you can buy everything you want in  reasonable price in the building. Especailly, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap. However, you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish. Conclusion In short, the Amusement Centre is  fascinating place and it deserves a visit. I would highly recommend this building, because not only you can enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors. ",34.00
710," Dear Helen Ryan I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going to this trip. Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions. I would like to travel in July, as it will be summer, and the weather will be nicer. Accommodation in log cabins would be better for me, because they are more comfortable. One of the activities I will do is tennis, but I am just a beginner, so I would like someone to teach me. The other activity will be photography, which I am very good at. I am wondering if there will be anywhere for me to wash my clothes, or if I will have them washed. I would also like to know how much money I should bring with me. I am waiting for your prompt reply. Yours sincerely, Bradley Tudela.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Many people enjoy going shoppings meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience. The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure, provided you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if these were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse. Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience. ",35.0
350," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement which inform me wrong information. While I had a holiday in London I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"", but I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him. I was so disappointed. Secondly, your timetable was wrong. It said the show started at 14.30 but, actually, it started at 20.15 so we had to wait for about six hours. Thirdly, I saw ""Discount Available"" on your advert but your staffs said it was just for Mondays. Your advert made me misunderstood. Finally, we visited your theatre restaurant after the show. However, it  closed because it was being decorated. Your advert promised me  ""Perfect evening out"", but it was  terrible evening to me. So I want you to give me a refund. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully, Ko Hyu Tung  [SEP]  How has mordern technology changed my daily life? When I was young, I used to play sports such as football, basketball and tennis with my friends but, these days, I am getting used to sitting in front of the computer and watching TV. When I bought my computer, I wasn't interested in it but when I started studying about  internet and playing games, I found it interesting. Sometimes, I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home, my hand go to  computer swich, automaticaly, even though I don't want to use the computer. I usually spend my time on playing computer  about three hours a day. After that, I go to the sofa for watch TV. Although there aren't programmes which are interesting, I just watch TV, so my mother calls me ""Couch Potato"". As a result, my health is getting worse. I know I need to excercise but it is difficult for me to start. Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity (??) ",27.0
753," Dear Helen Ryan, I am amazed with the prize in your competition. I am looking forward to go to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information. I would like to travel only in July because this is the only month that I am on holiday each year. About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in  tents because it will be a new experience for me. I like to get new experiences specially when I am on holiday. I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports as well. I am good at swimming and playing tennis. I would like to know how much money I need to have to spend there and if I need to take with me my sports clothes. Will the Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and play tennis? If you need some more information let me know. Yours sincerely Rita Fernandez.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that's give you more opportunity to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping at least they say that . Despite the fact that it love shopping I have to agree that it is not ""always"" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's boring. You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas. Another point is  now you don't need to go out just for shopping. You can buy a lot of products by  Internet. I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it. In conclusion I think there is boring time and enjoyable time when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring time. ",28.0
1055," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing on behalf of  students in your English class. Firstly, we are please and would like to thank you for your arrangement to taking us to London for 3 days. Unfortunately, some students have seen an advertisements for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we  all like to go to the show. This show will be taken place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March at 10.00 - 19.00, which include the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is a great opportunity to visit  because it is shown only twice a year and the entrance is free for students. Furthermore, most of us are designers so this might help to up-dated their knowledge as well. Therefore, I would like to suggest that on Monday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March, we still stick with your plan. We might change the schedule on Tuesday 14 March, from visiting  Science Museum to The London fashion and Leisure Show. I would appreciate  if the matter can be settled down easily and look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I remember when I was in secondary school. At that time, my friends and I was so daring and full of energy. One day before  exam, we were so excited and frighten because we weren't ready for  exam. We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk. One of my friend came up with the idea that we had to steal them. The question was who would be the person do this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me. I was so scare and frighten because if I was caught I would be punished. However, I had to do it otherwise my friend would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it. So, that afternoon in lunch time, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely and calmly. Finally, I was succeed in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it back without anyone saw me. That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood. I wouldn't have imagined  if I had been caught. ",30.00
1135," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the good programme which you have organised. There is only one thing we don't agree with you , it is the  Tuesday 14 March. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. and we would all like to go to this show. It would be very special for us because we haven't seen something like that before. There are four different shows. First there is a show with  latest fashions, after they show us the leisure and sports wear and then there are the make up and the hairstyles shows. The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of the show is free for students. You see, the programme has only to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping  how you have organised in your programme. In our opinion; it is enough to go one time in a museum and it is on Wednesday . Thank you in advance for your trouble Yours sincerely your English Class 4A  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Now, we are in the 21th century. Most of us live in houses or flats and it is most very comfortable. But in which kind of homes will people stay in the future? What will be different and what wont change? We can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer. I have further ideas: In the futur, maybe in 2113, there will are houses like now but only with more technical things. The life at home will be more easy because  a refrigerator which fill up itself or a bathroom which clean itself. So, people wont have to clean their houses because there are  machine for all  works. But I think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair. These things and a lot more went change or wont be forgotten. So, I think. houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present. This is my idea and we will see! ",26.00
111," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Last week I was on holiday at London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre. First of all the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed untill 20.15, and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replace him and he was really disappointing. Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available with the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there was not any. Last but not least, the advertisement says to visit your restaurant after the show, but when we went to the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill. The advertisement says that it is going to be your perfect evening out, but it was not. it was a complete waste of time and money. That is why I would like to request  full refund of my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but she was her best friend and she had to trust her. Anna told her again: ""Pat don't tell it to anyone please, especially to my brother everything will be ruin then"". and Pat answered: ""Don't wory I won't tell anyone"". The big secret was that Anna was prearing a suprice party for her brother, John and she didn't want anyone to know about it. She had told it to Pat though and that was extremely dangerous! Anna couldn't do anything though because she needed her help to give  the invitations. The party was set up to be in two days. The two days passed really fast and Anna was happy because Pat hadn't told anything to her brother, or so she thought! Pat went to Anna's and she seemed really unhappy. - ""Anna I have a confession to make"" Pat told  her and she started crying - ""What is it Pat?"" Anna asked and she started to worry. - ""I've told your brother about the party. I couldn't help it!, I'm so sorry!"" - ""What?"" Anna couldn't believe it, she was devastated, she started crying and told Pat ""Get out of my house, now!!!"" Pat left. Everything were destroyed the party and their friendship. ",32.0
992," Dear Helen Ryan; I have just received your letter which is made me so hapy. I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition, because I always belived I am an unluky man and now I think somethings are changing in my life. I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have  one month break at July, so please make my log cabin ready by july. I  prefer stay in  cabin because I have some experience with tents from my childhood and it was not  very good experience therefore I would like to stay in  cabin. You saying in your letter I could do two activities from the list which is show many exciting activities. I will definitly chose Basketball and Swimming wich are the my dream sport. I used to be play in  school team when I was in high school and our team was the one of the best Basketball team in  all county and I  also very good at swim. I would like to ask a few things, specialy  wheather: how is the weather  in July in the U.S.A. What kind of clothes I will need and how much money I should take with me, Because I have never been   U.S.A. before and I don't know anything  I am looking forward to your reply letter. Your sincerely  [SEP]  I have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowday  some people  are calling shopcholic. They are just like alcholics and this people are every day doing shopping because they can not stop themself unless they have not got money for spend. I can not believe how they doing this things every day, even when I need something at home I alway try to find out something to use instead of that things. Because nowdays whereever you go there is  big queue and I hate being waited. The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is  parking problem, if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you won't be alway luky  to find a seat to seat. If you go shopping for (buy) clothes that is the worse kind of shopping. Specialy if you want to buy  with your girlfriend or if you are already  girl you have to be read for hours to spend try on and off. I realy hate go shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they went into a shop they want try on every single cloth and they do not realise to time. Some people says ""shopping is not alway enjoyable"" but for me   definity unenjoyable and I think it will be  same   rest of my life. ",19.0
977," Dear Madame, I am writting this letter to informe you about the decisions I have made according to your questions. First of all I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June. I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month. Secondly I would prefer to be accommodate in  log cabins. When I was a child I was affraid of all these little insects that they live in the ground and this fear still remain till now. I also think that the log cabin will be much more confortable than the tent. asketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen. I play basketball since I was twelve years old and I am  member of the basketball school team for four years. In swimming I had won the first price of a local competition. Finaly I would like to ask you for some further informations about the clothes and the money we will need. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you already know, last month I was helping at a pop concert. It was a very excited experience and I really enjoyed  very much. I didn't have to do something very difficult. I was only responsable for the property of the back stages. But if anyone was been asking for some help I was always there. The most exciting  about this experience was to meet all these well-known people. I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them, but the truth is that they are men like us. They have a very simple life and behavior when they weren't on the scene If I have the opportunity next month I really want to go back. I will definitely apply for a place. Love Kelly. ",25.0
810," 12 Barcicka Str. 45-139 Warsaw 13 July 2000 Dear Ms Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter I received yestarday. I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At the beginning I would like to answer  questions you asked me in your letter. The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off (I am in charge of  project which starts in June so I am sure I couldn't go later). 'As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in  photograher's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in  cathegory of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started  few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would like also to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is. I want to thank you ones more for taking me into consideration in your competition. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Juliana Piotrowska  [SEP]  Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end. What did you feel? You had to be disappointed. There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time. Moreover, you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager. This leads to an escalation of your anger. Sometimes you could find a bargain. You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price. But at home you noticed that there is a tear on  sleeve. And you couldn't of course give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee. You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money. Somebody could give you not enough change. How would you feel? Deceived? So if you don't want to feel deceived or offended, think twice before you decide to go shopping. (A very depressing point of view, isn't it?) ",36.0
939," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to you to thank you very much for the price you're giving me. This is the first time of my life that I won anything like that. When I recived your latter, I could not belive it. I am glad to replay your latter. Unfortunatelly, I will be able to go only in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for this dates. My last holiday in  tend I had  very bad experience, the mosquitos nearly killed me. I would prefer  log cabins. With reference to the activities, I have never been climbing. I would like to try this sport. I am a lover of risk sports. I am  really good singer. I am enjoying a lot with karaoke. I am in doupt  which kind of clothes I have to bring with me. And  also ask you, how much money I have to take with me. Please if you could help me with this I will be very glad. Thank you one more time for everything. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Hi Kim, You cannot imagine what I've been up to. I had the best expreience in my live. I've to relax myself to expleint to you this very well. The company I work , works for Los Svaves, it's a very famous group from my country. Can you guess whe they chossed for the work, ""me"", yes me, I couldn't belived it. At the moment just I went just to one concert. My job basequily consisted in before and after the actuation, make everything ready. I've get used to do it very soon. To be honnest the most exited part of all this was  to know the group. The singer is  very nice gay, as  the rest of the group. If this happen  I'll write  you to tell you more. Your friend ",20.0
180," Dear Sir, I'd like to explain  you the problems I have had when I went to the theatre. The main problem I had was  the actor, because he wasn't Danny Brook. Although Tina Truelove was there, I went to the theatre to see Danny Brook. Another problem I had was  the time . I was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining. I'd like to explain too that I didn't see that you made  discounts to no one. I was queuing for a long time and I didn't see it . And I went with a lot of friends and we didn't have any discount. Another question is that in the advertisement you advised we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we couldn't do it. And we were very hungry after being three hours in the theatre. And that are all  problems I found. And, because of these faults, I'd like to have my money back. If you don't mind, of course. Yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I met Pat when we were children. We went at the same school and  at the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say it to him. When we finished  our primary school we went at the same secundary school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every weekends. And when we finished  the secundary school, I decided go to a foreign University. I spend five years there, although I came  all summers and we continued going out as we did before. When I finished I return to my city to find a job. A day, Pat told me that we was talking with this boy and that he told her that I like him and immediately she told him that he liked me too. A week after that I found him in a coffee and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted. Now, five years later we are going to get married. ",26.0
1085," Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for  English class, especially  it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in  English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement  on this week college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles, As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as  dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should  a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost  at all for students. But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go   Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day. But Mr. Robertson, these our suggestions are depended on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us. We are look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future. Have you ever thought about our future home? Living in a high building! But we could have everying we want to. Home might be a mixture with moden styles and  natural view as well. These days a lot of contries have been worried about lands that can't have enough place to build houses. The prises for lands are getting increasing it's because of this reason. So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat. Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors. It means  Japanese are planning for the future home. But what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school. Because we are living in  computerlised life, so we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well. But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in there. And because it'll be a big building we'll  able to see a whole view through the window. In conclusion, our future home will have a natural view like these days home and give people a new technological home life. ",21.00
1136," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all, I want to thank you in the name of the class for your good organisation and programme,  Especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time. We really appreciate this. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from 10 oo to 19 oo o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall. There will be shown the latest fashions about leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't been ever before in this kind of show. As well as this, the entrance for students is free. As you can see this is the best time to go there. We have some suggestions about how to change the programme. Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something. To sum up, this is a really great opportunity for us and I don't think that the changes are so big. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  The man is a being that need to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him. As well as this he needs his own free space and privacy. This is also  important to him as friendship and family In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press. Just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The yellow press is searching for every little  information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people, just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat. The photos will be on tomorrow's press and so rumours are born. On the other hand the people have choose to walk on this path. Everything in life has a price. The price for fame and money is the lost of privacy. First of all you have to give up something for getting something else. However, the press shouldn't create rumours and hunt those people like animals. As well as this, the stars shouldn't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy. They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before. The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous. ",35.00

They just meet each one a month ago. During the time before the consert I had to look if every one was present. Also I had to look for  dried place in case it was raining. I really liked . I had to run all the times. This was my job and I like what I am doing. The consert was briliant. I am looking  to hear the new from yours group. I hope all the best for you! With Love ",12.0
1137," Dear Mr. Robertson. I am writing on our class behalf to thank you for organising our tour in London. Our class is very appritiate you for the good programme. Especially, we are interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich at the afternoon. It is a good idea to include the visiting of the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery at  morning time on Tuesday and Wednesday respectivelly. However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show. It is a great opportunity because of the following reasons. Firstly, there will be leisur and sports wear and the latest fasions. Secondly, there will be exibitions about makeup and hair styles. Moreover, the entrance for students is free. We suggest changing our programme a little bit. Instead of Wednesday's afternoon free time we could visit the Science Museum. And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fasion and Leisure Show till 19.00. After all we will be able go shopping. I am looking forward to recieving your positive reply. For the further details you can contact me my phone number. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Famous people. What does it means? From my point of view, these are the people, who stay all  time in our sigh. We  intrsted in politicians's and film stars's wear, hobbys, passions and the intrigues. The lardge numbers of the journalists following them all the time, even in there private life. In my opinion, each human being has  rights to be free. We can go for a wolk, go shopping go to the cinema,  marrige or devorce. Why famous people couldn't do all this things? Why everybody must know and tolk about their private life? The most important thing  that the famous people are also normal people as us. They live as us, they brief and eat as us, they even following in love as us. I think, they must have a normal, private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them  in the different newspaper's curiouses. ",21.00
803," Dear Ms Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter  2nd of March. I am writing to give you some information about myself. I am very keen on joinning Camp California in the U.S.A. I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this travel only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August. I m always been intents when I went with the university camps so I  prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in there. According to your activities at the Camp, I would choose singing and painting because I am a lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity. Also painting is my hobby because I have always been painting when I have a spare time. I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and How much money I should bring. Once again, thank you for giving me a good opportunity. I look forward to going with your camp in the near future. Yours sincerely (THONGCHAI ENPHENO)  [SEP]  Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable because of different reasons and places. In the first place, some housewifes don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you   forget to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore! Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want. Sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no  your size left. I cannot imagine anything worse. The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay  everything  buy  credit card. When a bill comes to £1000, you would be shocked and regret what you had done. In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully. ",31.0
247," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the rainbow, that took place in the Circle Theatre. There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisment. The first problem was about the actors. In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play  main roles. But I was very disappointed when I didn't see them on the stage. The second problem was the time of the play. The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I was waiting for the show for a half-an-hour! The third problem were the discounts. The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not. The last problem was the theatre restaurant. It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunatelly it was closed. To conclude, I am not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a fully refund. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  There are many different creatures on Earth: animals, insects, plants. But the most developed creature is a human. He lived  nearly 10 000 years. During this time men had developed and now are the leading creatures. They built huge cities, destroyed forests, got into space. Now, modern technology has changed our life. And, naturally, it has both advantages and disadvantages. The modern technology, on the one hand, made our life easier. We use different electric kettle. We build big cities, there are hot and cold water, electricity, gas in particulary every home. We use different transport that makes our moving faster, it fastens our life. We communicate with other people by telephone,  mail, we read newspapers, we watch television,  get different information from  internet. But, on the other hand modern technology destroyed our life. Factories polluted the air we breath, shops polluted the water we drink. Many different uncureable diseases appeared. For example: cancer occured in Africa after American nuclear tests All in all, technology made our life better by destroying the environment. In future possibly the technology wouldn't destroy the environment, but we have to do something now, because tomorrow can be too late. ",24.0
100," Dear Mr Jones: I'm writting  you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on  your theatre. To begin with, the actor you publised was going to perform, didn't. To make things even worse, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late, at 20:15, and there weren't even your famous discounts available. As it wasn't enough, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and  not very hard to guess  I wasn't able to enjoy it, as for it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to sell food, the perfect ending for the perfect evening. Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go an spend the money in a good play when they do what they've promised. Waiting for your to write back Yours  [SEP]  Modern technology is, nowadays, not only a ""tool"" for every day life but also a lifestyle. People are getting more and more adicted to this, because  helps  every day life to be easier and more confortable. In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. From a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio to a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play  or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school. I think that anything that can make our lifes better, should be done, because that way we wouldn't have so many things to be concerned about, and we would be able to live a happier and more relaxed life.

You asked me which  accommodation I would prefer between  tent and  log cabin. I am used to spend summer holiday in  tent and I like it, but why not try  log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could practice tennis and surfing.

When you got to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but there is no more of it. You think that shopping is not enjoyable at all. Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there is too much people. You don't like shopping but you must go shopping to eat! But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time (the girls know what it is). finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of  time it isn't enjoyable! To conclude, if you don't want to go to the supermarket to spend four hours there, send your girlfriend and it will be more enjoyable! ",33.0

I suggest and we went shopping. In the time we want to go out of a shop a man stopped us and hold a pistol in his hand. We were scared and so we did all what he told us . We were lucky that we are in life now. The police came and took hi to the jail (police station). You can't be carefull because you don't know what time it will happens.

Concerning the available activities, firstly, I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years.

First of all, I would like to tell you that I've never had a such good time in my life! The day one consisted in surrounding the festival's place with fences. The second day objective was to install the scene, with lights, loudspeakers and all stuff. This job was quite hard, but we took enough time to be not exhausted! The last day, in fact the concert day was absolutely fantastic. The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer  front of the scene, to avoid the people coming on the concert floor. Finally, the concert was exactly that the people were expected. I hop that the next time you will come with me! I'm looking forward to hearing your impressions about this! See you soon. ",30.0

Firstly, you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove,  instead of them we had two others and they were really bad. So I was really surprised. In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late. It was boring for everybody. How could we appreciate the show properly. Moreover, in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case. No discounts were available. Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people. You offered something impossible to do. I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give  my money back. I hope your understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible.

I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her all the story. She said that I had to be strong and didn't care about them.

The problems started in the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist. Moreover, the show was delayed forty-five minutes and the worst of all was that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor. On the other hand, the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons. You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous! I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back. If you don't agree, I will act consequently. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last Wednesday Carole received a letter. The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters. She didn't recognize the writing. She began to read ""Dear Carolin.. There was only a person who used to call her by this name. It brought a lot of memories back to her. It was long time ago, when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen. He was her first love and also the first who kissed her. Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father's work. When they were saying goodbye Paul  ""I will be the last person who will kiss you"". ""It sounds nice but I don't believe it"" she replied. ""You only have to wait"" he said. But she didn't wait. She got married and had two children. At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they didn't love each other any more. Their love had finished. In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again. Her friend Pat had explained the whole story at her husband. What she would do? ",31.0
571," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter. I am absolutely delighted with the news. It really took me by surprise this prize, I didn't think I would be so lucky  to win. First of all, about your enquires, the only time suitable for me to travel is in July. The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, there's no further reason is just that  would be a new experience for me and I'm very excited about it. I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities during the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love sea-sports and their chalenges. Finally I'd like to ask you some questions, there are mainly  small details. I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes, if not what sort of clothes I should bring, and also how much money roughly I will need for my daily expenses. I would be very grateful for your help and advice in this matters. Thanks for the wonderful news. I'm looking forward to it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim My dear friend I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am. You must remember me telling you about the pop concert, well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it. The concert was a huge success, lots of people came and enjoyed the music. I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially when the musicians arrived, they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get. My tasks were very especifics. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and weir and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage. I really enjoyed working with those people, they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes. However, what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing, jumping and enjoying frenetically of something that I had been part of and helped to make it happened. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best Wishes ",35.0
605," Dear Ms. Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. I appriciated to this big news. Please, let me tell you my answer now. First, I would like to travel during July. Because my college will finish in the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August. Second, I prefer to stay  a log cabin. I usually stay  a tent during camping. Actually, I don't like tent so much. Therefore, I am interested in staying  a log cabin. Third, I chose painting and golf as activities. I learned painting when I was  school student. Specially, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to  golf club when I went to university in Japan. Finally, I would like you to advise  about clothes and pocket money, which I will take. Thanking you for your time. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is always enjoyable for me. I love shopping. I never feel tired during shopping. Especially, I prefer to go  department stores. They are heaven! I can spend in there all day. In fact, they have many kind of products which make me happy. To be honest, I don't always buy these products but I can be satisfied with just looking  them. Some people doesn't like to go shopping with a friend who takes  long time to decide. Even in this case, shopping is fun for me. I believe there are  lot of why to enjoy shopping. By the way, shopping is a sort of therapy. I sometimes go shopping when I have stress. Shopping helps me to cheer up every time. I think many people, specially women, had  same experience. But the most important things to enjoy shopping is not to use every  money which you have. ",29.0
842," Dear Mrs Ryan I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competiton of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. This august I will start a new job so the only possible month for me to join in the Camp is July. I hope this will cause no problems. I am glad that you offer for accommodation not only  tents but also  log cabins. Because I am a light sleeper and have problems with my back I prefer to sleep in a log cabin with a comfortable bed. Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do Singing and Surfing. It is difficult to say how good I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad. I never did Surfing in my life but I am a very good Snowboarder and this could be an advantage. I hope I gave you all  informations you need. There is something I  like to know from you. Should I bring some special clothes (surfing) with me? How much money do you think I have to change and is there a possible to get more (bank)? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely Rosalinde Schulz  [SEP]  Dear Kim Last saturday evening I spent a wonderful time. The motor bike club of our town organized a pop concert. A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment. The only thing I had to do was solving the different problems of the guests and just being there if they have any questions. Some people came from Germany some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A. Talking English with the people from England or the U.S.A. was wonderful. They were all very kind and with some of them I spent the rest of the evening and also the following day. That I reached a lot of money for doing something I like very much was very nice but the most important thing for me was meeting people, having fun and using the English language. I will never forget this evening. Love, Rosalinde Schulz ",35.0
837," Dear Sir or Madam I have just received your letter. I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply for the camp. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have to return to my University in the middle of August. Your another consideration was accommodation. I think it is more comfortable to stay in log cabins than in tents, so I would prefer log cabins. According to your letter, I can choose two activities to do at the Camp. I would like to choose painting which I have been doing for 12 years and tennis. However, I am not very good at playing tennis, so could you tell me if I can learn at the camp? Please could you also let me know if I need to take special clothes with me? I would be grateful if you  phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience. I look forward to the camp in the U.S.A. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Cry Freedom 'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them. In the first part of this book it can be seen  Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa. Although Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world. In short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again. Most of all, this book will make you think about the prejudice you have. ",37.0
845," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions! In connection with the questions you asked, please find my answers as follows: - I could prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave. - As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersome to me. - My choice of sports are swimming and tennis. Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years. Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so. Please let me know if meals are included and if not which facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self-catering. Looking forward to hearing from you, I remain, Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The book Cry Freedom by John Briley is certainly one which will take its place in South African history. Therefore, I think it is a time document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again, also by non-South Africans. Generations of young South Africans black, white or brown will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years. A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force. In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment. It is my firm believe that this book will remain a piece of literature which will not lose its actuality, in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion. ",35.0
608," 13th June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan Thank you very much for your letter which I have received it this morning. I am so pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition. Firstly, I would like to go to Camp California in the U.S.A in July because I still have got an examination in my college until June, 20th. So if it's possible could you arrenge it for me please. And also, I would prefer the log cabins to the tents otherwise I have never slept in the sleepin bag before. I imagine I could'n sleep at all. Secondly, I would like to play basketball and tennis at the Camp. They are my two choices of activities. Because I used to play tennis and basketball for ages. Finally, could you give me your suggestion about money and clothes. What kind of clothes are suitable to take with me and could I have any benefit from you for my trip or not. Could you please send me more information about this. I am looking forward to receiving your reply soon. Yours sincerely, Yumi Nakamura  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim Hi! How are you? Thank you for your kind letter and I am glad to hearing about your news. Kim, I would like to tell you my wonderful experience last month! On 5th of May which was  national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time work at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome. The pop singer  called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert was start  7.00 p.m. At that time I was in the second floor where I had to work is. I did a part of gard job. I stood up in front of  audiences and I had given an attention to them. I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs. I thought if you were here I could really enjoy  with you. All of her funs were stooud up the whole concert and dancing. I was so exciting night. Some of  funs were not good at all because they shouted and argued, but most of  people were very good. I had enjoyed so much with my wonderful experience.

294," Mr./Mrs Manager, I am writing to complain about a musical show I went  one week ago. Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour. To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts  as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy  the cheapest and worst seat available. As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance. I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the £10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame. Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Well, it's pretty simple to answer this. Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer, I didn't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games. The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and  evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them, I kept on stucked in front of the screen. Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC. After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed. I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web. My daily life would be harder without modern technology. ",35.0
449," Santigo, June 17th, 2000 Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the add on the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was. One of the reason I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor announced in the add,  Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with forty five minutes delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The add also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason! It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket prize, it is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  We can hardly imagine life without compures, T.V. sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than  our parents , thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of.  Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our life will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our life easier, technology is welcome. ",32.0
129," Dear Sir, I am writing to complete about my being to the Circle Theatre during my last week's holiday in London. I have seen a musical show and it was not my favourite time. I am confusing because of playing different actor in place  Danny Brook. Secendly, the show started at 20.15. This is why I was feeling invited to your restaurant after  show. Unfortunately, I found closed doors and any information about the reason. I would like to add that being a student I find discounts very important for my budget. Neither without any reason  it was not available. I will  gladfull if you will send my money back. Your faithfull,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason whe we were  horrible troubles with  police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk with us. Let's  back to the beginig of this story. I with my friends had  holidays and decided to spend a few days on a ""island"". We called this place like this, because it was a  land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning on a land - to our town. There was no light during nights so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was a walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered a gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place when  robber keept stolen gold from  bank. We found the solution of this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but... I think you are able to imagine what was happen later. ",21.0
1088,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing you this letter to complain about  you have organized  us for our trip to London. First of all, I would like to thank you for your activity programme. I find it really good, specially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. But I would like you to know that on Tuesday March 14th in London, there is a show, which is free for students, about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles called The London Fashion and Leisure Show. All the clan would enjoy going  the show, because it is a great oportunity to see an exhibition as the latest fashions. We know that you have planned a very complete programme. But we would like to suggest you to move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, so that, we can go to the show on Tuesday, which lasts from 10 am to 7 pm. Thank you very much for considering our petition. I look forward receiving your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Nowadays, in our society, there are some people who, because of their work or because of their success in life, has become popular, and by now is known by everybody. But, how does fame affect to their lifestyle? Politicians, musicians or film starts are controlled all the time, since  they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do. It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV,  go to shows,  sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things can not give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world  to pay that. But obviously, if these people are all the time in the newspaper, on TV and so on,  is because, although we don't want to accept it, we love following their lifes. So now, all we should have to ask ourselves is if their damaged lifestyles is in part our fault. ",31.00
1217," 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference. First of all, the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel. It is very near York Railway Station  which you can get there easily. By rail: get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side. By bus: most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station, or you can take a taxi. Secondly, the conference is  very important event for all of us, we agree to wear formal dresses. For example, men should wear suits, ties and the so on. In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show. It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group. Finally, on the last day we have an afternoon free. It would be grateful If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings. If you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you. I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Inventions have affected all our lives! Nowadays, a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days. A car is one of the invention which is very useful. I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially,  I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so on? In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes  long time to go somewhere. The car has largely affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than  use public transports. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand. I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car. In conclusion, I think  car is very important to me and it has affected my own life. If I have more money I will buy another car. I think it has more advantages than disadvantages. So, we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car! ",27.00

I would like to book my tickets from the beginning of July. The 3rd of July will suit to me. As far as I know accomodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I prefer log cabins.

Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable, is it? We can't say that  is always enjoyable or  is not. Every new day is not the same. But... I think that good shopping depends on ourself. If we decided to by somthing special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it. Probably, maybe not. Some times we have to have deal with not good service or for example could you imagine it on your way to  shop you have met wrong people or someone told you bad news. Or  quality of your new thing is not so good that you really expected. Situations are variously. Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to  night-club but you are short of money. Some people will do crazy things in  situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party. But I want to wish you have a good enjoyable shopping all your way. ",25.0

My job at behind the stage was helping  make-up, hare and clothes staylist. It was very hard. The singers often changed them clothes and them make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat. It was different from  I did  at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singer and spoke to them. In front of the stage was so many people and they couldn't see them very well, but I was at very near from the stage and I could see them just there. You like pop music, don't you?

1130," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, thank you for your programme. It is very various and interesting. We all enjoy it. But last week we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. This presentation will show the latest fashions and the leisure and sports wear. We would be very interesting in seeing the english fashion. At this show we could see different new  make up and hairstyles. The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students. For pratical informations, this show start at 10.00 and close at 19.00. It will stay in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It is not too far and the openning hours fit us. About the programme, we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping. As far as we are concerned we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery. We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and  the afternoon, if some one of us is intersted, we could see the National Art Gallery. I hope you won't be too angry for this changing but we would all like to go to the show. Waiting for your answer, receive our greetings. For the class  [SEP]  General speaking, homes will change considerably. They will become less dark and more confortable than today.  People's homes will build more economically by using natural energies like solar or wind energy. This improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling energies. About the size of hous, I think that in cities houses will be more and more little because of the over population. We also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats. In opposite, in the suburb or in the land, more and more rich people will build big houses. Homes like this will be build with the latest technologies and  very luxurious. But about  differences between  rich's and poor's homes  will be the same in the futur. New technologies and facilities won't improve the relationship between people. I think that people will be as alone and julous as today. ",23.00
556," Mrs Helen RYAN Competition Organiser USA 13th JUNE.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter in this morning and thank you very much for your kind letter and  chosing me. I can only travel in July because I had already booked and fully paid for a middle-east holiday, from 25th of July till  end of August. If you can arrange my departure time from 1st of July it should be convenience for me. I would like to stay in  tents because I had much great times in tents during my previous holidays, if it is suitable for you. I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp: Sailing and photography. I have great experience for sailing. I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey. And I have done  certificate for using  radio (VHF). I have knowladge about navigation, engine , ropes and knots and  sails as well. My other passion is photography, especially I like black and white photography. I have a camera which is a called Minolta X300. That is a manual camera. I know  to develop films and print them. I have doubt about clothes, money and  immigration rules of the USA. please could you write me how is the weather like there, what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping . I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and  products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products. Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card . It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless. As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about £500. This experience has changed my shopping habit, now I do all my shopping on the internet. But I'm not sure how it is safe. But you must be always award against to pickpokets. ",32.0
190," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - over the rainbow. I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which is published on the newspaper. According to the advert, it says clearly that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, for whom I was coming. After the show we went to the Theatre restaurant, but it was closed due to the refurbishment. I am not really satisfied about the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out. I therefore would like to have a compensation of  £30 which I spent on the tickets. Your Sincerely   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread out the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it. I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful. but this idea was soon be put off since I noticed on the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck, I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. The last few days, we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'. ",29.0
378," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' I've visited it last evening in your 'Circle Theatre'. By the way I would  enquire about  some money back. I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by visiting it. I believed in the phrase by which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect. The show should  started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very wrong and afraid about it and I remember that this was the third problem this evening. By arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there will come another problem. The problem came. The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show for eating something, was closed without any explaination and the perfect evening was completely unperfect. I think this are reasons enough for enquiring about  some money back. I would be gladly to get an answer from you. Faithfully, Bergut Hunrtner  [SEP]  What will we wear 100 years from now? Fashion changed every year. Do you remember what people wore 100 years ago? And by the way do you believe that they also thought the fashion never changed? But the fashion changed. 100 years ago the people wore long clothes and large robes. You can say they wore a lot of clothes at one time. Nowaday people wear lesser clothes. Often you causes very litte and short robes and tops. Often you show your skin because its popular  and everyone do it. So it's possible to wear nothing in the future. A lot of thinks will be easier to do. But in the winter there's still a problem which is to solve. In the winter you'll freeze. But this problem is solving by itselfes. The sommers and winters get warmer. The season for this is the global warming, which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible. But by some situations you have to wear something. The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special kind of producing. So don't laugh about this idea. Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it. It's possible. ",21.0
1090," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to thank  for your interesting and excellent programme, that you has organised,  especially concerning the opportunity to visit the National Art Gallery and the Science Museum. I am also writing to ask for your permission to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show, which would be on Tuesday 14 March. It will be a presentation of the latest fashions and about the leisure and sports wear. Moreover there will be a demostration of a modern make up and new different, shaking hairstyles. I would like to add that it could be definetely a great opportunity because the tickets will be free for students. Finally, I would like to suggest that we could attend the show after visiting the Science Museum, instead of doing shopping. Many thanks in advance for your cooperation. I look foward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it"" Peter whispered smiling at me. it was a cold, stormy, winter's night outside. The wind was blowing and the heavy rain was drumming agaist our bedroom window. I could hear a owl hooting in the tree nearby. My husband and I were sitting on our bed. Peter, my husband, was a tall, strong man in his mid-forty. We used to remember our daytime before felling asleep. As a postman, Peter, had to deliver letters aroud our little village. He knew everybody, especially Mrs Rilke, an elderly, eagle-eyed teacher in retirement, who lived in a old cottage with her five bad-tempered dogs. She has never received any letter, since that morning.  ""She was very angry when I arrived. She stared suspiciously at me through her glasses on the tip of her nose. After I had opened her gate, she called loudly  her five, horrible dogs. I realised I had to run away, but I had still her letter. Suddenly I made up my mind, and running as fast as a champion horse I reached her hands and left the letter, then I went away quickly and, fortunately,  just in time to close the gate between me and the dogs!

You have informed the actor, times, discount and the restaurant to people, but actually what did you do? The first, you have changed the actor. The second, the time is late from 19.30, it started 20.15. The third, the tickets have not the discount. The last, after  show, I couldn't go to the restaurant, because it was closed. What's happened? This is the good theatre do, or not? This is the famous theatre. You know, What did people feel?

If you can not managed the programe, why did you informe people before  programe start? I tought you inderstood'; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me? Thank you,  [SEP]  Now we know, our world have developed to new world, becase we have high technology to do. If we came back to the past, we felt everything, it was so difficult to do, we would have plane and done by ourself and last time. In the present, the teachnology is a past of life.

181," Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre: I'm writing to you to explain some problems about your theatre's show, first I have to say to you that there was a different actor  starring  the act. I expect that starring the act was Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the hour that the act started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour. About the prize, the paper that I have at home tells that there were discounts availables, if these discounts are true I couldn't use them. When the show had finished I couldn't visit the restaurant of the theatre because it was closed. The reason they gave us, was that they hadn't got any waiters. For all those reasons I give to you, I ask for the money I had payed to you back. In my opinion it wasn't my perfect evening out. I'm sorry if I make any problem to you, but I'm very angry and it was your fault. Thank you for your attention,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was fourteen-year-old and I was with my bestfriend, Pat. We were in a private school, that looks like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted that we became good and polite girls. The life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to get funny in there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school, this path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought that was  good idea told to Pat because we could use  to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told to her, she promised to me that she  kept the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic and secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told to a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story like a bad experience.  ",21.0
1224," Dear Mrs Maria Smith. I was really pleased to receive at your letter. Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can. So, I'm writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for. Firstly, we've booked Palace Hotel, which is located in Central. The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using  tube because it takes only 20 mininute. The tube is 2 line which is red colour. And your speach would be better for the end of conference party. I'd suggest you to wear at least, semi formal wears such as a jacket with another clothes. Finally, I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area. The museum can be helpful to understand our country's history and art. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Computer is the most important invention in our life. Some people might say the electricity  more important than  another thingh. It's hard to say which is the most important invention. However, I'd say  computer is  more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone, the car. Recently  computer is really necessary and we can't manage to work without them. Not only is for bussiness, but also in for my life. For instance, when I want to contanct with to my friend, it's quite helpful by using e-mail. Before  computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact with to foreign countries at the same time. And also it's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computer more than before. Despite  amazing invention, some times  computer makes  big problem, such as  millennium bug (some people called   ""2000 problem""), because computer  not flexible enough like a human's brain. However,  computer is worth to use in our life until  more coveniance machine will be invented. ",20.00
392," June 17th 2000 ""Dear"" menager of the Circle theatre, I went in London for a week of ""pure holiday"" thinking   to have some fun coming to see your musical show. On the advertisement it had been written that there would have been Danny Brook too. (I like him very much and, truly, I came to the theatre just to see him) When I entered I didn't get the discount (as it has been written!!) The show had to started at 19:30 and I arrived before, frightened  not to find a good place to see ""my hero"". I have waited for the show beginning until 20:15!!!! Is it a correct thing? I was getting angry, but, finally, the show started and I became quiter. BUT.. when I saw that the actor wasn't Danny Brook but a different one, I was very disappointed. So, after the show, I would like to have a good meal in the ""famous theatre restaurant"" (that, of course, was closed for a free night!!!!) At the end, I asked for  money back (and paiment for my orrible night): do you think anybody  give me back something?! I hope, that in the future, you will understand that it isn't right to write false things on an advertisement. Thank you for your attention. Faithfully  [SEP]  Science and technology characterize our moder society. They have taken a big progress in our every day life and they have always become more important for us. If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comfort (born just in the ""industrial age"") everything had to be done by hands or by animal work: I think in that time life was really  harder than now! We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society ""their good fruits"" but, at the same time,  negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or ""green"" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize are the main problems of our society. I know I'm  ""daughter of this techological world"" and unluckly I think I could'n stay without it: it's rather strange that today there's already somebody without  phone, dishwasher, TV... But, sometimes I ask myself if the ""ancient world"", without science, technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the our one. ",21.0
651," Dear Helen Ryan, I am glad that I have won first prize in your competition. I have been very surprised winning. You ask me in your letter when I would like to travel. The answer is the following one: I only can travel  July because I have to work all August. I can take holidays only  the month of July. You ask me if I prefer to sleep in tents or log cabins. I prefer the tents because I never use such kind of accommodation. I have choosen the two following activities. First one is Tennis and  second one is sailing. I played tennis for many years. I have even done competitions. I like a lot this game. I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport. I love water but I never try this sport before. I would like to ask you two questions. How much money do I have to take with me for these two weeks and what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me? I'll be very happy to see you soon. Yours sincerly. Yves DUTEIL  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems. The first thing is the place of shopping. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping. The third thing is the trouble of full shops. Everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying  those things. People are often nervous and agressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women. There is one more thing. When you are a man and your wife asks you to come for shopping, be patient! Because women loves shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always giving your opinion about clothes, music, parfums... ",29.0
250," Dear Sir I had been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show in the Circle Theatre. When I saw the advertisement about the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see ""Over the Rainbow"", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about that. First of all, when I bought the tickets I had no discount, and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some, and when I got in the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late. I had had not a perfect night at all, so I would like to ask if I can have my money back. Please give me an answer. Thank you for reading this letter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  We cannot deny that technology has changed our lives. Nowadays, we do not need anymore to spend hours cooking, for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave, and in a few minutes our meal is ready. We can communicate with people in distant countries in real time, using the internet. There is a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people's lives. I would not do my school projects without using a computer, because I have to do some statistical analysis that I would not do with a calculator. Also, I can communicate with some friends who live in other countries by e-mail almost every day, and I save some money because I pay for a local call, and not for an international call. An other thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone, because people can talk to me whenever they need , but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting.

332," Saturday, 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writting  you in order to obtain you my money back, concerning the musical show: OVER THE RAINBOW. I live in France and I recently spent a week's holiday in London. I decided to go to  theatre to have a nice evening. I saw your advertisement in a newspaper. It seemed to be very attractive. But in fact it is not! I had a very disappointing evening. First of all:  actors  were mentionned  are not the same  . I supposed to see the famous Danny Brook, and what a surprise it was  not him. I was very disappointed. Secondly the show had go on 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanations. Thirdly it said that ""discounts available"". This is not the truth. After that it suggested  to visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed! It is a shame. And you write, I quote  ""your perfect evening out"", excuse me but I do not agree with you. It was awful, the worst evening out of my life. So please, it would be fair, that you give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in a near future. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""What will clothes be like 100 years from now?"" In my opinion, clothes will not change so much, because fashion is an eternal cycle. You will find always  basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change. We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included. For example: a short very classical   inside of it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find too some buttons, to have.. fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe on your watch you would have a screen to watch your favorite soap operas. Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadgets with old clothes, like a dress of the middle-Age. Do not worry about this, it will not happen! Fashion is always the same!

620," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am writing in response of your questions. I can travel only in july because  is the only month of this year that I will be available because I finish school in june so I will be very busy  and in August I start to study at the University, so july is the best month for me to travel. Accommodation for me is not  problem. I am very easy going and I will be satisfied wherever . But if I have to choose, I prefer sleep in tents, because when I travel I usually sleep in that kind of accommodation so, for me they seem very comfortable. I would like to do the following activities: - Tennis because  is my favourite sport and I enjoy playing it. I play tennis since I was a child and I have won some competitions in my town so I think I play very well. - Climbing because I have never climbed in my life and it is a dream for me to do that. I am a terrible climber but with a little bit of help I think I can enjoy the activity and have a good time  unforgettable. I wonder to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in  U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring to the trip. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello Kim: Thank you for your letter it was great to hear from you. Sorry but I haven't written  you because I've been very busy. Last month I helped at a pop concert, it was marvellous. I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to me work with an English singer so I said ""yes, of course"". But you can't imagine who was the singer, it was Sting, can you imagine? You know, he is my favourite singer. My job was very easy I had to help Sting in everything, for example if he wanted water, I had to give to him water, it was marvellous. He was very kind to me, we talked  many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have a dinner, yes I know what you're thinking, ""Dinner and Sting"" yes my friend it was the best thing  in my life. I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoken very well English. The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it and I met my favourite singer. I hope my friend call me again to work  because I had a wonderful time and it was a great and unforgettable experience. I hope you are O.K. and write soon. Lots of Love P.D. I send you an autograph that Sting wrote for you. ",29.0
259," Dear sir, I'm writing  you to complain about the disappointing expirience I had with your theatre. First of all, I arrived at about 19:20 because  advertisement said that performance begins at 19:30, but it wasn't till about 20:15 that the begin of the show and I had to wait  entire hour which was not very amazing. Secondly, I was supposed to have a discount but there were no discounts, although the advertisement said there are. Thirdly, the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why. And at last, the most disappointing point, the advertisement again said that there would be Danny Brook, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him. So, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that  advertisement promissed. As things went that way, I want my money back. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I shall have a look into the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen. How much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make even  cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use  different kind of cooling  and will tell you if your forgot to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to  devices modern technology offers us. ",33.0

I don't mind staying in log cabins, but I prefer camping because I want to be really near the nature.

[SEP]  Nowadays shopping is one of the activities that makes our society lives. The cities are the main commercial centre, our streets are full of billboard advertising many things  and. Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable, when you need to buy something you have to look for the best price, what is always a work of time, and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper, it must be crowded. The solution can be in a alternative way of making shops like  Internet. You can by anything without  problem, this is a good thing although this prevents poor people from shopping by  Internet, because you have to have a computer. Anyway, other alternatives of shopping are being created and we can choose for not waste our time shopping. ",26.0

You writer that the actor was going to be Danny Brook but he wasn't there. A different actor was played and this was very disappointing to everyone. Also the show did not start at half past seven o'clock as it was said but at eight and fifteen o'clock. Everyone get bored  until the show start. About the discount that we are going to have. Why it does not make to us? I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. as it was closed. Everyone after the show run to take a good seat at the restaurant but everyone  disappointed when they see the sight which said ""Close for today"". That evening wasn't my perfect and I have to say that I want my money back because the show was a disaster. I'm really sorry I am saying this but  is the true. I am hoping that you will not make such mistakes again. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is a friend of mine and we are friends for almost a year.

The last Monday, I went to the theatre with two friends. We arrived on time but the musical show was delayed untill half-pass eight. Moreover, we hadn't any disscount for beeing students. On the other hand, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us. When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late. We couldn't have a drink.

Finally, it would be grateful if you could answer me soon. Yous sincerelly,  [SEP]  Our lives are changing. When I was a child I had different entertainments  that the actually children hadn't. We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy  without a computer. We hadn't so many machines than they have. The technology is growing and growing. If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want. It's very important but some times it is a wrong thing because the children can see it too. Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up. We can find information about the weather, sports on our TV-text. On the other hand, the science is changing. We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems. Actually, we can cure illness which were very dangerous before. I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer, UTH. The new technology is changing our lives. ",23.0

As the letter said that all questions you would like to know, I'm going to give you in the following: Firstly I would like to travel in July only because I have two months holiday which are July and August, I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I'm free. In August I have to work so. Secondly I prefer the tents because I've never been in that tent so I would like to try. Thirdly for the activities I would like to chose climbing and photography, I have never done them before. The only reason is I would like to try and I think they are matching activities, when you climb up the mountain then you can take the photograph of the views. Eventually I would like to ask you, are about money and clothes. How much do I have to bring the money? And what is the weather like? which  I could bring them to be match the weather. Yours sincerely Sintawichai Chaow  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is when human goes to the shop and buy what they went, however I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes  all sort of things. Anyway shopping is not always enjoyable as the title  because firstly you will get tied because you have to walk out and in the shops. Secondly you will get angry on  bad treatment of the sellers in the shop. Thirdly if you're fat you won't find you size. Forthly that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy to much things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by your self. I think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it, do not go shopping give the money to charity, that is better than shopping. For me my opinions on this one  is true it is boring, it might  because I am a boy. ",23.0
285," Dear Sir, Re: The Musical Show Presented by the Circle Theatre With the reference of the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000, I, as a consumer, who is a musical show avid and a great fans of Danny Brook, who is said to be stared in the show, would like to complain about the presentation. 1. First of all, I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook. whose name was stated on the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be. 2. The Price of the ticket was said that there would be discounts available. However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show. 3. I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to the shortage of food sold. I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off. With all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return. I would consider to bring this complains to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explaination from the theatre. Thank You. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past, now and also in the future. However, things re recycling from time to time. So do the objective of wearing clothes. I will imagine that, people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past. The people in the past wear clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind. On the other hand, the people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is  result of a developed and full-grown country. I think people in the future will likely to wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided. It is because of the increasing number of  population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere. They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective. All the above ideas are needed to make them bare no burden when wearing these special designed clothes. The future is a hope and a dream for everyone in the earth. Therefore, I will suggest that we all nov to keep the enviroment clean and healthy for the next generation. ",29.0
951,"  Miss Helen Ryan, I was receveid your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA. So I will answer you about this different points. I would like to travel only  July because I think, it's the best month for  enjoy my holidays. About my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more confortable than a tent and less hot with the sun. Nevertheless, I hope, there are water and light inside this log cabine. Between your different activities, I will like to practice: 1. Surfing because I never do it and I will like to learn it. 2. Photography because during my freetime I make some pictures about persons, country, -- - So, I will want to have more experience and a better technique to succed at a good level. Nowthere, I would like know if it's possible to change my activities during my sejar. Can I change some moneys in the Camp or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And know the different prices for the same holidays? Thank you for answer my different questions. Salutations.  [SEP]  The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys,  times; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD, whatever. But, it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in a office, a manufactory, a society, you have the same planning to them. So you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go the Saturdays but  badly,  there are too  costumers. You can't walk,  try clothes ,  it's very hot. The salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service. In England, there aren't paper for make a present. It's different than the other European countries. Sometimes the sales women aren't friendship, because they have some stress or they aren't the sale feeling. Finally I think, it will be better if the shops stay open until 7.30 pm (half past seven). It will be a good service for their costumer and  more cool for them. ",18.0
437," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show, which was played at The Circle Theatre last week. Unfortunalety my feelings are rather bad. I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning  'Over the Rainbow' musical show. The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. Especialy due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' even did not appologize for this range. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have been ( started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite I am a student and the advertisement said that discounts were available, I was refused to buy a half-a-price ticket, and the explaination 'why' wasn't sufficiant. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which according to the advertisement ought to be open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angier. There was no information  why it was closed and if it would be open at all. The advertisement say 'your perfect evening out', however it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you give me my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday, however on Friday almost half of my class knew what's going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I would pass the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving center for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I hope that nobody would watching me. Unfortunately Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The instractur opened the car  and asked me to sit on the drivers sit. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very ofen crossing the white line on the road. I looked at the mirror and I saw how my friends were lauthing. It made my crazy. I started doing stupid things: turn right instead of left and so on. Next day, I decided that I don't want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment  my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. Eventually the things weren't so bad. I went to school and everyone was very friendly. Pat appologized  me for not keeping the secrets. At the begining I was very angry but in the end I said that everything is O.K. We are good friends nowadays, however I will never tell her my secrets. ",25.0
1035," Dear Mr Robertson, Many thanks for the programme you have organised. It is really interesting and diversity at the same time. There is just one thing I want to tell you; Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show. That is in the central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is only about fashion:  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students (what is really good). It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to go in. And, as you know we all are interested in fashion. In my opinion, I would suggest to go to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or, going to the show on wensday morning and on the afternoon, we can choose between free time or  National Art Gallery. I look farward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I went out of the room, ran as much as I could and started thinking  what this man was doing here and who he was. When I arrived in the street it was dark,  windy, but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street. By the time I arrived here, he has disappeared. Suddenly, I felt very tired and decided to go home. My sister was standing, crying and showing the front door. I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her. I finally realized that she was dead. The police arrived twenty minutes later, took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder: lucky, the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him. They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside. Everything was going on, when one day, I came in the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her. ",25.00
518," Dear Sir, I would like to complain about the show which you presented on last saturday. It was such  disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week's holiday in London. We have had a quite pleasant time except  the evening. Actually it spoiled our time. So I would like to get back our money. These are some points I want mention about the differencies between  the advertisement said and the realities. First, I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role, but he had never shown up that night. The main actor was an unknown actor. It was a such disappointing. Second, it started only at 20:15. It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be. It was a such boaring to wait  the show in a noisy and hot theatre. Third, there was no possibility of  discount. The girl  sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mention about  the discounts availability was written in the advertisement. Forth, the theatre restaurant was closed. There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend. How could you arrange work like that? Finally the sentence  was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true. It was  most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced. I wish that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need give back the money we paid. Sincerely Yu Phu Tung.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me. First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite  long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even  I could meet some friend, but I couldn't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language were different. I really wished to have a friend  can share everything  is going  in our lives. Finally I met Pat. She was a such wonderful person in our class. She tried to help others when they have  difficult time at school. One day she realized that I was always been outside of  circle. One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in  weekend usally. We had a fantastic time together for three monthes. Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books. I thought that I  found a good friend in my life. So I told her everything about my life. There were some stories I never told anyone before, but I had share with her all my secrets. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Few days later I told her about my secret love story, it became a top gossip among my classmate. It was a nightmare! ",14.0
527," Dear Sir or Madam, Last month I went to the theatre with my husband to see OVER THE RAINBOW. I'm sorry, but I had a very unpleasant evening. First of all, the play started 45 minutes later. I felt so angry about that. And discounts were not available (nobody explained the reason ). Secondly, the actor wasn't Danny Brook. I wanted to see him! He is a good actor but I saw a very bad one. And we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Such a bad night! I'm sure you will complain the reasons why I want my money back. If you couldn't do that, we will accept  to go to another play. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And Lorca knew it. But Pat was in the wrong place in the incorrect hour. That's a story of a crime of passion. Let me explain it. In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city (a small town near Savannah). Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her. But she was in love with a black man, called Jim. And Pat, the maid, saw them in the river. She couldn't keep the secret and told everything to another maid. In  few hours everyone knew it. Pour lovers! When Jim's wife knew it she caught a gun and killed her husband. Then, she cried and cried holding him. (If she hadn't do it, Lorca's father would had made the same). It was a shock for Lorca. She jumped into the river and killed herself two days after. Pat and Jim's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives. How could they forget it? ",33.0
959," 13th June Dear Ms Ryan I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to receiving your letter in which  said that I have won the first prize in your competition, for two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A. I am writing to inform  that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place in the university and it will start in August. Is there the time I request available? I would also like to ask  accommodation you offer are in tens or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer tens. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning. In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities. I can wait to do my painting for the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers . Finally, can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with , and how much spending money will be need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely JUAN LILY LEE  [SEP]  13th June Shopping is not always enjoyable. I don't really like shopping. Sometime when I'm boring and can't find something else to do. I go look round  shops. When I see some clothes in the window I like, I would go in and try them . But I always finds it  not look nice on me. The other thing I don't like going shopping is in the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the articals like rubbish. Hang them every where after they tried  and  that  was not suit them. Also in the weekend shopping. You do can't find some where to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, the all full of people. However, shopping is nice to spend you leisure time and give yourself  to relax sometimes, but  suggest that never in the weekend. ",22.0
260," Dear sir or Madam, I was one of your customers who had a very disappointing about Over the Rainbow show at your Circle Theatre yesterday. First of all, these starrings of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. The only one reason I bought your ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove, as your advertisement had shown. But your starrings were not . I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the show was very very late. It started at 20:15 and that waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service. And also the ticket discounts were not available. That was not your advertisement had shown. And finally, your restaurant was not available after the show. From every singular things I have complained, it was totally different from what your advertisment said. And because of this, I would like to ask for my money back. If you see that this is a good reason, please telephone me. My telephone number is 123-4567. Yours  [SEP]  Thesedays we are living on a high-technology world. Modern technology has been growing rapidly and it has effected me a lot. Indeed, I have to save more money for upgrading my personal computer. Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumes like me and you definitely have to pay our money to keep our personal computer up to date and able to work with  new computer softwares that require more and more performance of computer hardware. Anyway, modern technology such as the Internet changes me a great deal of life-style. Using the internet, I can search for almost all  information I want to know. And I can send e-mail to my friends via the Internet fastly and cheaply prepared to the old-style mail-services. Finally, I think modern technology makes me do my business faster, smarter  with much more efficiency. ",25.0
515," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing  you to show my disagree about the musical show 'Over the rainbow. First, I am very dissapointed with the starring. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike. Also, the musical did not start at 19.30, it started forty-five minutes later. That is why,  it finished later and I arrived late to a basketball match. Another thing is that there were not any discounts in the entrance fee. Finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because it was sunday. It is closed all sundays, you have to say it. That is why I will be pleased if you give  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why I didn't want to tell him that I had failed my natural science final exam. I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed, before we were on holidays, they will cancelled the trip to Africa. But, I need to say it to someone, so I told it to Pat. The next day, all the class knew  it. I wasn't too worried because if someones is going to see my parents, I would tell them before not talk about the exams. But, when my mother was talking with Pat's mother and she mentioned it,  my mother cancelled the trip to Africa. It wasn't Pat fault, it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and also, I knew that Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",26.0
446," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should be one of the stars, instead there was one for me totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start. Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there was no discounts what so ever and finally, because of a shortage of staf, your restaurant was not available for us. This event was not what I call: ""a perfect evening out"", as your advertisement promised. I feel entitled to compensation for this event. I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities. Yours faithfully Carolina Patharius  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so stupied, telling her my secret after all I  been going through to keep it to myself. But now when the story was out, it was just to start to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around and worring about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face. I decieded to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lession. That evening I went to her house. I pretended to be totaly miserable. Pat didn't know what to do, she apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated. Finally I smiled. After huging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets. Especially not if it has to do with failing all  exams.... ",31.0
470," Dear Sir/Manager, During my visit to London, I had the opportunity to visit the Circle Theatre and to see 'Over the Rainbow'. To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected, as it completely contradicted to the advertisement. Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible, and disappointing. Secondly the starting time of the show was far from punctual. I had gone to the show which according to the advertisement was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15. In the advertisement, it said that discounts were available. Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered. According to the advertisement, the audience were free to go to the theatre restaurant after the show. However by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed. I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement  stating that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was totally the opposite. I hope you understand my disappointment. In addition, as a way of compensation, I would like to have a refund, and  justification for such a show. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology change your daily life? During these past few decades, or rather,  the 20th century, there has been a significant developement in modern technology. One of the essential developement is  the form of transportation. The invention of cars planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time. This enables us to save  great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented. This compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in  small amount of time with hardly no effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less. Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances. There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves. What changed my life most is portal computers. They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often. Before I used computers generally, It took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information. With a computer however, all this is done in the matter of seconds. This again enables people to save time. The modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible. However if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and as a result, would not be able to live without them once they are gone. ",32.0

421," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I've seen on last Saturday. I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to  drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than  original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset much at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention about  that actor was going to change to another guy. This thing shouldn't be happened. After  finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised. It was about 21:00, I thought it was  bit later but it wasn't my falt anyway. The show was finished at 21:00. When I went there the restaurant was closed. We couldn't even get any sandwiches. I'm so upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show. I look forward to hearing from you before I do my futher reaction. Your faithfully Ann Kim.  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Nowadays, we have millions  styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion. Fashion became a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is  most important thing. We spend lots of time to choose clothes or shoes. A 100 years ago, people wear much more diffrently. Women worn dresses and men worn suits in England. It was very formal fashion, but now people wear more sexy clothes than 100 years ago. Fashion keeps changing. Therefore, in the future fashion might be changed a lot. I think people will wear metal clothes like  Robotcap. The enviroment will be very polluted and finally we'll get desease. We will need helmets to cover our head and we will also need air-supplyer. May be, science will be developed and make our enviroment clean,  we will not wear anything at all!!! (except under wear). I hope that the enviroment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be. We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in further days. ",24.0

If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to go on my holiday in July. On your letter, you are going to provid me one of tents and log cabins with accommodation at Camp California. I would like to be in tents because I can find it being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins. I am very happy because I can have a chance to do activities while I am at the camp. I would like to take part in the Golf and the sailing. I am not goot at both of them. I have been interested in them so I would like to turn up them on this chance. Finally, I would like to know something about travel. Could you let me know whether I need extra money or what sort of clothes I need. I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be the first time in the U.S.A. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I was happy to get your letter. I haven't writen a letter to you for ages. I'm sorry about that. On your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert. I'll tell you my experience about helping  the pop concert. At first, I applyed for the volenteer at the pop concert and then I got a responsibility for control the audience. I had to make the fan to keep  a queue. I also make them find their seats. It was very hard working. For example, I always spoke loudly and run fast. However, there was something good to me. I saw a lot of singers and entertainers. I didn't need to pay  enterence fee because I was working there. Plus, I got a authography from a popular singer. I'll give you the authography for  present. It is valuable of keeping on your suvinier. I'll tell you more  experience on  next letter. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best whishes ",20.0

I am very greatfull and I want to thank you very much for letting me do this trip. I think it is very kind of yous to ask me what my preferences are for the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel  the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays starts. Answering another of your questions, I am more likely  to stay in a log cabin considering that I will be to weeks in the camp. They are much more confortable than tents. While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing. I have not done any of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it. I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes should I take, and how much money do you think I will need to bring with me.

Anyways, do you remember my last e-mail, where I told you that I was going to help at a Pop Concert. Well, I'm going to tell you about that awesome experience. The band played at my school so we could raise money for our graduation trip. I asked them if they could play at our school and they told me it would be 350 pounds. ""The Moicznos"" are so popular that we sold our every ticket and end up wining 2000 pounds. Appart from calling them, I also helped building up the stage, and took care of the lights. After the concert the whole class helped cleaning up the mess the people left. I can tell you that it was a wonderfull experience. What I liked the most about it is not the fact that we raised a lot of money, but that we enjoyed of an amazing show in which I took  active part. The band thanked me very much for calling them and having everything so well organized. I hope you liked reading my story. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",34.0
63," 25th November 2000 Dear Mr Clark, I have seen your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday. Most of the events were wonderful and well-organised. I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my inmature views of it. Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves,  also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all  events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is  really economical  to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that  was his cheapest weekend. Moreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some  concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect. This are only my inmature views, if it is considerable for you, I will be very pleased, thank you very much. I'm look forward to hearing your replies. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  16, Dec. 2000 Dear Yasmin, It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday, you asked me about rules; both at my home and at my school, I am very happy to tell you about this. At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood, it tend to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use  Internet, there are only ten computers in the school, only teachers can use it, if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school. At my home, there are many rules, because I'm careless, so I amn't allowed to smoke at home as well: and I'm not allowed to use  telephone, because last year I made  £1000 bill for one month, my parents were very angry with it, so they told me I am not to use  telephone any more, oh, How poor! How is the weather like in England, I hope it isn't too wet, please give my regards to your parents. Lots of love, ",26.00

The Hotel is near the station and is call ""Grand Placad"". When you arrived you take the train for Guildford and after  you have just across the road, in front of the station. It's  very confortable hotel where you can find everything you need. From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50, that stop near the hotel and arrive in  town center. The conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to found it. At the end of  conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of  word and they could speak about their experience. I suggest for that conference to wear somenthing very confortable but elegant, the organisation want for all  boys wear  jacket,  the tie is not necessary. I don't know rely what you can see, three hours I think is not enough but near the station there is a beautiful garden popular for its variety of flowers. If I found somenthing special  to visit in three hours I call you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Ser or madam it is very nice of you to come and visit my town. In that area there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting building to visit. The best building you must see is the cathedral. It is the more important church in that area for its architeture. It is somenthing very particular, its paviment made from many small pecis of wood, its windows  with many colours, it is fantastic. It was built on the top of the hill and around  there is only a huge field. You can arrive here wolking because the bus stop just on the bottom of the hill. But really you must see it, the position of the cathedral give you a somenthing special a big tranquility. I hope you like it. I look farword to hearing from you best regardes ",22.00
1054," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to thank you for the lovely programme you organised for our trip to London, especially because we will have both cultural trips and entertainments, like shopping. I can tell you that we are all looking forward to going there. However, I have been asked by the class to propose  you another visit. We all would like to go and see the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday 14th March, from 10.00 to 19.00, in the London's Central exhibition Hall. This show is about the latest fashions, the leisure and sports wear, the make-up and the hairstyles. Everybody in the class is interested in this show, and it would be a great opportunity for us to see it, especially because many of us would like to work later in the fashion . Moreover, this show won't cost anything because it is free for the students! Consequently, I proposed  to change the programme as follows; on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping, we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, during our free time. What do you think about that? Hoping to hear from your decision soon. Yours sincerely, (class 3CD)  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time."" Nowadays, most people think that famous people have a so good life ( lots of money, comfortable house ) that they have to stop complaining about he media's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life. On  one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the audiance, and soon. Moreover, especially for film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the Tv or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their fame. However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographs all the time. You can't go outside quietly, and there is all the time a crownd of people who stands in front of your house waiting for you. The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have all the time people around your house who are watching at you or people who are following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this. That is why I think that famous people deserve a private life, like everybody , and that journalists should not follow them everywhere. ",33.00
423," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW. Regarding your advertisement, it is the LONDON'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW, but I was deeply disappointed at it. According to your advertisement, the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE. I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings, but at the day I saw it, a different actor played. He was not DANNY BROOK. Moreover there was no discount ticket. They were all sold out. You should have said they were very few. I had to buy a £20 ticket. To make matters worse, the time that the show started was delayed. It started at 20:15, fourty five minutes later! That's why I couldn't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show. It had already closed, when the show finished. I'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night. Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my life. Especially, a computer has made my daily life change dramatically.  It is only two or three years since I  have used a computer at home, but now I wonder how I can live without it. I open my e-mail box every night. When I find a new message, I'm very happy. Before using e-mail, I used to write letters and sometime  telephon. However I've found e-mail is better than them. Because as soon as I send my message, they can receive it. In the other word, I can also receive their reply soon. It's really useful, when I need  quick reply. Overmore when I send e-mail, I need not worry about the time. I can send them anytime I like. Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day. ",31.0
1026," Dear Mr Robertson. I'm writing  you about our journey which you have already orginesed. First of all, thank you for your good programme. We saw your details and enjoyed  them. Especially  River trip to Greenwich and visiting  National Art Gallery. All the students in my class are excited about one more thing. We saw an advertisement about  Fashion And Leisure Show. It will be at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is Tuesday March 14. The show can be seen between 10.00 - 19.00. This show is about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles. One more thing about  show is,  it's free for students. Isn't it a big opportunity for us? As you know, there is a free time in your programme if you don't mind, we can go for shopping in this free time. This changing, give us an opportunity to go to  show on Tuesday afternoon. We hope you an accept our suggestion. It will make us so happy. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerally,  [SEP]  A PRIVATE LIFE All people have some difficulties about their job but some of them have more than the others. Reason for this;  they are famous and everybody wants to learn about them. Having a private life is important for everybody. I think, people want this. if you are a famous person, for example  singer, film star, politician or well-know footballer, you haven't get any choice. Because people want to learn about you everything. so journalists are following you all the time. I know, they are not like us. They are famous, but I think they need to be alone sometimes. They nead to be with their family in silence. This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them, too. I think  media must be more understanding. We don't have to learn  their every second. We have to remember that, they need a private life like us. We can love them without disturbing  too. ",33.00
1059," Dear Mr Robertson I would like to congratulate you for the excellent programme that you have prepared. I think that  is such a good programme especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting. However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London  where the latest fashions will be shown. There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles, too. And it has free-entrance for the students. We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London,  the 14th of March. We think that, if you don't have any problem, we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show. We are wating for your decision and we will accept it whatever it  be. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  ""THE HOME OF THE FUTURE"" From any point of view, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just  pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa. Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very important, they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier. The cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. In balance then, I think that the houses that we can see on films won't really exist. ",33.00
1178," Dear Mrs Smith, I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best. I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference. As far as  organisation is concerned,  adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station. To come to our college, you can either watch downhill to the lake front (about 10 min) or take the new cable car from the train station. The college is just stairs away from the bottom end. The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. Appart of that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear. Depending on the interests of your students, I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office: www.neuchatel.ch. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Where are you? is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone. Why? Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever. The mobile phone. Once heavy, expensive and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers. Due to the mobile phone. communication has changed, not improved. Of course it allows  to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy. Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes, we should right on it CAUTION: use of this device may damage your brain. ",30.00
50," Mrs. Jane Clark, I see your advertisement about  Internal Arts Festival now. I think that's a great idea. As we need some good activities.  Advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world. This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote. I think you should invite  from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world. If you invite from more countries to stars and artist, your festival will be unbelieved.  Second point is there are some jazz, rock and classical concerts. It's a good idea but some concert halls are too small. Because of these, people are bored quickly. You show plays and films. I congradulate you because it's perfect. The most important thing is dance shows. As more people like dance shows, me too. That's the real knowledge for us, art exhibition and talks by writers. I think we know a writer life or how is he writing  it? it's  very significant thing. Lastly, you said 'one reasonable-priced weekend ticket for all events'. It's excellent. If you can pay attention to my small suggestion, next year I hope it will be  unbelievable festival. THANKS! Yours sincerely!  [SEP]  Dear Edmond I miss you very much and sorry about  didn't write you some letters. I hope you forgive me. What are you dong today, how is your school? My school opened yesterday. As you know I am a new student. It is very difficult because I don't know anybody. However; today I  used to my school, I have got two sweet girls. But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class, we have been talking about Rules, both at home and at school. It is very boring. For instance; you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers. The most significant rule is you must not smoke in public places, or in the toilet. You continuously must study hard. I feel very bad because what you are allowed I aren't allowed to do at home. Are you understand me? Can I change my school? Please you will write me a letter quickly. Lovers! ",17.00
265," Dear Sir, During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I saw an advertising which  seemed very atractive to me. I have to say, it was not the best musical show. I think it was pretty bad. I had a very disappointing evening for many reasons. Firstable, I decided to come see your show to be pleased by the act of Danny Brook as I was so sad to find an other actor on the stage. Another thing was the hours. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's enbelievable  to be late with 45 minutes. When I got to the tickets desk before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available  as I read on the advertising. After the show, I went to the restaurant to have a drink after all of these disappointments, but the doors were close because of renovations. I think you will understand  it was not ""my perfect evening out"" as you said, but one of the worth. For all these reasons I am asking you to give  my money back. Best Regards,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she put me in such trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed together in a host family in the surburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met  very interesting so everything was perfect. We had mostly a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I had only 19 years old  as everyone know that the majority for beeing able to go out in the USA is 21 years old. If you don't have   the majority your aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or even worth to go in a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and me decided to go out in a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in it. At the entrance, the security guard asked for  identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I've forgot it  home. The man said it was OK for this time and we get in quite easely, we've made it. It was such a fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to be thirsty. We went at the bar and ask for  drink with alcohol. Of course by the time we get in it we forgot all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking any time 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening, ending with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping so well a secret!! ",25.0
497,"  Dear manager of the Circle Theatre Last Sanday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the theatre you were supposed to present. We thought that it was a good chance for us to watch it. ""Over the rainbow"" was supposed to start at seven thirty. We went there on time. We waited ther for forty five minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it. We really got bored as all the other peaple there. We were very disappointed because before this happened we pouded the tickets but there were no discounts available. And then delate forty five minuites to present the show. Then we expected to, see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook. That was very disapponted. Fortunately the show finished. We decided to visit the theatre restaurant. But it was closed!! That was  bad organized evening we thought. When we asked why was it closed the people there told us that they did not organized it before I must admit that, that evening wasn't the perfect one out for me but I and for my friends either. It was the worst evening that we all ever had. My friends and I demand our money bacck real soon. And please do not be very suprised If you recieve more letters about this  [SEP]  Unfortunately; Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I did a big mistake by trusting him. What a fool was I. Last Wednesday my sister told me that our grandmother had a serious illness and she was going to die. She told me to tell none. We didn't want out grand-mother to find it out at that moment so we was trying to keep it secret. I knew Pat, my cousin, loved our grandmother very much. She and Pat had a special relationship. Despite the fact that I had to tell nothing I thought it was right to tell Pat the truth. After a lot of thought I told it to him. Pat started screaming and shouting. I knew he couldn't stand it. But I was sure he would tell nothing. I was wrong. He told me that he had to tell it to my grandmother. I couldn't do anything. Just as Pat left my house he went right away to the hospital. He found her there. And the worst happened. My grandmother was very sensitive and bored  life and when she heart it her condition became more serious. After two days she died. Pat my sister and I felt very rensposible. But there was nothing we could do. We knew we had lost her for ever. ",25.0
5," Dear Jean Clark, I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it. Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement. Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them. I look forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Sorry it's been too long since I last wrote but I've been so busy at school that I couldn't answer you before. As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First I must tell you that  teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good,  mum and dad are great but there's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem  she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it. I really must get down to some homework now so I'll stop here. Give my love to your parents.

655," Dear Helen, I've just seen your letter and I'm really delighted to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer. I would prefer to be in  log cabins because I feel insecure staying in  tent. While I'll be at the Camp, I would like to play tennis and  swimming. I've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day. I'm very good at swimming and my level  is medium at tennis. If possible, could you let me know what I'll need for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend. I'm excited to  go on holliday there and thanks to you, I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I want to tell you about my good experience I had last month. I'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous. At first, I'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order. They were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene. At the end, we have had a beer and we talked together. I was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends. During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up. It was unbelievable to realize that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends. It is difficult to explain what I'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people which I'd known only for  few days. If possible, I would like introduce you to them, they are very nice guys. Best wishes ",31.0
639," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to thank you  to send me all the details about my prize and I'd like to give you a complete information about the journey will be done by myself. I would like to travel at the beginning of the month,  could be between  first and  fifteeth of july, because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip. Related with accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins. Although I like camping and sharing with different kind of people, I'd prefer a confortable and private place (if it's possible) where I can sleep, or be quiet.. I am not a teenager! Really, this prize is wonderful to have a healthy life. I want to do two activities; painting and tennis. The first one is for my mental health, I need a break in my style of life. the second one is just because I'm  fanatic of that sports (really I'm not martine hingis). Eventually, I'd like to request to have  special food, because and vegetarian person, besides I try to eat just organic food. I hope my reply has been suitable. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you doing? It have been a long time since the last time I wrote  you... I'm sorry. However the reason is absolutely amazing. I was training to be a personal assistance to Madonna herself. Maybe, you don't believe me, but it's true. I applied to the job and she selected me between hundreds of candidates (I don't receive  salary). My work is to help her during each concert. You know, she has a brilliant performance where she must change her customs, make up,  scenery, everytime; so she needs a lot of people near. My first job was in the Hillsborough's concert ( I think, you heard about it). I was running all the show, my responsability was to get dress her. I wasn't alone, I worked with a staff of ten people. We had to take of some clothes   and then to put on others ones completly different, in just  few minutes (similar to Formula One). I was exhausted when the concert finished, anyway it has been one of my best experience and I'll remember  for life. Finally, I send you all my positive energy and I am looking forward to receiving your letter back. all the best. ",26.0
898," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I have just received a letter from you and I am really happy to hear the news that I have won first prize in the competition. I would like to tell you something about what you asked me in the letter. Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except  July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin. I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for  few days but not over 3 days. It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin. Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography. I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year. On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college. Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money. Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cram, sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer. Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Shin Parade  [SEP]  Do you think shopping is always enjoyable? Well, it might be true but I think it depends on the situation. When you do shopping, you can see various products  even very extraordinary thing. You can also see more graceful and fine thing. You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you. On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want. Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing. If  shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping. In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even varys with  people whom you shop with. ",31.0
635," I am writing in reply to your letter, which I have received last week, and in fact I am very surprised and please for the prize. First of all I would like to travel in July because  is my  free month since I am student and I am very busy during all year. Secondly, according to accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a long cabin, due to I used to use the tent on holiday and I haven't got very good experiences. Thirdly I chose photography and swimming because I have previous experience in these activities and of course I have some diplomas which I will send you. In addition, I work every summer as a Monitor in the leisure centre in my town. Apart from this photography is one of my favorite hobbies and I usually spent nearly all my spare time practising it and of course I have some diplomas as well. Lastly I would like to ask you for some questions. On the one hand I would like to have further information about which kind of clothes I need for that area. I don't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both . On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes, since I need to know how much money I have to take. I look forward to receiving a prompt reply. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello it's been ages since we were in touch, I'm sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I have been very busy last month, with this job. I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed  a lot and of course I knew a lot of people there. I found this opportunity through the Radio in an advertisement. On the one hand at first I was a little insure about if I was able to do this job, because they needed people with some skills and experience. But later I decided to call them and ask them for further information about this job. After a interview I was chosen for it, I couldn't believe it. I feel that this was a good oportunity for me, not only for my professional but also for my personal life. Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of my speciality,  for me was the most important real experience. According to my job, I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience: at the end I felt  a member of them, because they were so kind to me, and I could colaborated a lot of and I learnt a lot with this project. Furthermore, I found it very short time and they offered me  new project for the summer. I hope to hear from you soon. ",26.0
645," Dear Madam, I am very happy to hear that I've won first prize in your competition. Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for. I would like to travel in July. I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best. As for accomodation I would prefer log cabins, because I belive they are more comfortable then tents. The activities I would like to do during my stay are golf and surfing. I never tried those sports, because they are quite expensive. I have two questions. Could you tell me what are the weather conditions in California at that time of year, because I want to know what clothes to take. Am I supposed to take an outfit for sports as well? The other question is about money. Will I be given any pocket-money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences? Yours sincerely Adalbert Turnau  [SEP]  First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is  great idea. Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there. I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic. To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film. Below are my suggestions of what should be filmed. The first thing to be filmed is our English lesson, because our teacher Mr. S. has a lot of weird ideas and we could get a lot of fun moments on tape. The chemistry lesson should be filmed because we do a lot of interesting experiments there. The computer class can be also there, because program and internet surfing is quite interesting. As for other activities, there is a Jiu-Jitsu class after regular lessons. Martial arts are realy exciting and are a great thing to film. ",31.0

I have sailed some in my youth but have never went climbing. It would be a fun experiance! Will I be needing any money. Please send me a list of needed clothes and/or supplies. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, Gilbert Neville P.S. I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks? Does any medication  have to be declared to them? In case of any accidents, will the transport back home be paid for?  [SEP]  Why can shopping be unenjoyable? First of all, it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for. Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment  anything they see. Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know. Women, in perticular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see. If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes (usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when  being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance. It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots an othe pair. Shopping for me is supposed to be a very fast experiance. As soon as someone else is with you, it can become horrible! ",31.0
169," Mr Manager, I'm sorry of writing  you for such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you announced: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased  to see Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the scene! By the way, what really upset me was the time of starting. According to your advertisement it was at 19:30, and, what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost which was from £10 to £20, but despite my thoughts I had to pay £20 without   chance. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me. As you can see it's not a perfect evening, isn't it? I'm asking you  my money back, you can do it, can't you? Wondering your comprension your sincerely  [SEP]  THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA - Ernest Hemingway As I see it, the Old Man and the Sea is a really exiting book. It describes a challenge, the challenge of life. The major characther is the old man who has to fight against the sea to keep alive. It could be his last adventure. This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish  something good. By surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen, a beautiful marlin. The man keeps immediatly in contact with it. They are going to be one thing linked together. They're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish. I think they're really brothers, they feel the same pain and fear during the battle. If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man's  same thing. When the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased. He respected and still loves it. But, afterwards, the life's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that's the most difficulty  to face  to. ",24.0
1099," I am writing this letter because we saw your programme for our next trip to London and we would like to suggest  you just one thing. First of all, we would like to say you thank you very much for organised our tour around London and our programme wich is considered for us especially good for the places we will visit. Secondly, we saw last Saturday in the Oxfor News one advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to know if  could be posible to inclued this show in our tour. The show is going to take place in the Gernal Exhibition Hall in London, the thurday 14 of March, so  could be a good idea to see this show intead of go to  Science Museum. We think that it could be  great opportunity because in one day we can see every thing about fashion clothes, new makes up and hayrstyles. Furthermore is student free.

491," Dear Manager, With this letter I want to show  you some problems I had last week in your theatre with your show. First of all, I want to introduce myself. I'm Francesco Schein, I'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very upset because the show had many problems. First the actor was changed and his  performance was very poor and disappointing. Then, the show began 45 minutes later, so we had to wait  very long . The advertisement said there were discounts available, which were not . At the end you said it will be a Restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything untill we got home. I hope you understand your faults and I'm asking you for the money back. Faithfully Yours  [SEP]  I don't know if technology has totally changed my life, because I was born with it and I have learned  it since I was a little boy. For example, I was born knowing the man has stepped on the moon. There are some machines which have helped in my development, and others which help me to make my life easier. The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in past time, when everything was send by common mail, and it took weeks till it got  the right place. There are other machines which are bad for the environment. Many industries throw their contaminated air away, without cleaning it before. Technology has to move further so it can solve problems  as pollution, so we can live better and longer. ",22.0
502," Dear Sir, I am writing to your to complain about the musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" As a matter of fact, I waited for seeing Danny Brook who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he wasn't here. Besides, the actor who filled him in was unknown and specially boring. Secondly, the show had to begin at 19.30 pm, in fact he began at 20.15 pm and that without any explainations! Your advertisement mentioned that discounts were available, however when I asked for them to the staff they replied to me that they weren't  discounts! After the show, I wanted to visit your restaurant and once again, I was disappointed because it was closed. Anybody could explain to me why! I can assure you that it wasn't a perfect evening out and I got very annoyed about this evening which could have been wonderful. That is the reason I would like you to refund my money. I hope you would take notice of this complaint seriously. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life changed in some ways when I got the hand of using new technologies. When I started work, I wrote everything I made on sheets and if sometimes I made mistakes, I had to cross  out and it wasn't very well-made. I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate. Now, I enter datas and I don't need any more to calculate my figures, the work is completely made by the computer and in addition there is no mistake. If I have to find out  timetables, it is very useful to have the possibility to see  on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! At the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for . But after a while you gain experience and you get soon used to this kind of research. Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone. As a matter of fact, if I am stuck in my car in the traffic, I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I would be late. Once, I saw an accident and I could call the police. Sometimes the ring is annoying but finally, the mobil phone is a great handy object. ",30.0
679," Hello, Firstly I would like to thank you for your prize. This travel enjoys me because I never go to  USA. Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only  July because I study in an ingenior's school in France and in Summer we have  holidays since July. I prefer to live in tents, where it is easier to make contacts with other people than in log cabins. When I travel I don't often sleep in  hotel, I prefer tents and also I can meet people, who lives in the country. For the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. That is a sport that I always want to practise but in France it is to expansive. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to fail it. I would like to photograph  too. There are so much monuments in California and so I will remember these holidays with my photographies. Could you send me more informations about  clothes to take with ? Finally I would like to ask you, if I need some money because you say all accomodation and travel costs are paid for. Thank you for your answer. Charles Dumaux  [SEP]  Hello Kim, Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was marvellous!!! I was in the backstage, so I could speak with the singer before the concert. During half an hour he explained  me, how he feel in France. I had to serve glasses of water to the group before and during the concert, so I had a lot of contact with them. They are very gentle. After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium, where they had played. What I particularly liked about this experience is that I saw that famous people are like us and have the same interest. I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps in the next concert we will go together. I will give you news about it. I hope you will answer my letter and say me if you are interesting in my proposition. I send you with my letter a photo of the singer, what he give me. See you later. Charles ",26.0
494," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called ""Over The Rainbow"" and ask for  money back. This show was presented by the Circle Theatre. First of all, the poster told me that this show was performed by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there was different actor. I am so disappointed. Secondly, the show was expected to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I have been waiting for 45 minuties. The poster also told me that I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show. As you know the show started late, so, I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed before the show has been finished. Thirdly, there was no discounts available but it was printed on the poster. If there was no discounts, don't write it on the poster. I got confused and  disappointed again. Finally, I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward for your prompt reply and improvement. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The world is changing every day. So, modern technology is needed to meet the requirement. In an every single day, many modern technology is produced and it really affects or changes our daily life. The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world's computers by some telephone liens. You can send a letter to your friend by an e-mail but not writting it on a piece of paper and send it by post. It just takes you a few minutes. How convenience it is! There are also much more advantages, you can buy somethings in a supermarket by only a mail order, you don't need to go out of your home. Other than the internet system, there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life. For example, we can go to the Mars and do some invesgation. So, we know much more about our universe. Some modern technology is also put into the transport system. For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster. The modern technology has changed our daily life. It aims at improving our standard of life and makes us live more comfortably. So I think the changes are good. ",21.0
770," Dear Mrs/Ms Ryan, I am writing  you because I would like to answer the information that you ask for. Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free in my job. It will be impossible  another choise, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think  is the best month to travel, the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons. Secondly, my choise is the accommodation in tents, I think it could be more interesting, I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside, in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like be at home. About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it, I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago, I felt really healthy. My other choise is painting, I paint since I was ten years old, I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class. A thing I would like ask is if I need special clothes, I don't know what kind of camp I am going . It should be a dry place, I think but I would like to make sure my guess, as well, I would like to know how much money I will need, because it is also all paid I don't know if there will be some gift shops. I look forward  hearing from you. Yours sincerely Patricia Reyes  [SEP]  - Shopping is not always enjoyable - The most popular ""sport"" that all the people do it's obiously shopping. This is the thing that move hundred and hundreds of people in the world and we don't have to go to Japan we have the evidences here in England. But the question is: Is shopping always enjoyable? Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewells, furnitures, etc. and you could have a real great time. But other people don't think like this, for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl get lost. The mother was shock, she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in the places, it was  nightmare but fortunaly the police found her. Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops? I don't thing that I'll enjoy it, all the people knicking you, you can't walk properly or buy something, and also there are  lot of cases which show how people can be in shops, I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where we are going!! In my opinion shopping is not the thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful,  too many people in the shops, so I prefer spend my free time go swimming or painting and I go shopping in the days that usually there are not too many people. ",25.0
102," 17.06.2000 Hello Sir, ""Um very unpleased that I have to write you this letter. I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much. On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" in the ""Circle Theater"". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just  a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed because of renovations""! We thought it would be a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something. I would prefer getting my money back, instead of taking a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again! Sincerely Hedwiga Heinkel  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from the day on, that  he knows anything about our secret we will live in danger  being caught. We, that were Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me Hedwiga had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we won't attack them. We had this idea first, when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love of first slight and we were fascinated by the thought,  building a kind of the same organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heaed of some people paying, ""safty-money"", but never know the reason, until he found a big amout of money in my room. His thoughts combined and ready to go to the police he went out of our house, where me and my homies were just hanging aroud. He saw me and tolled me into my face you are a thief and a burglar and I will go now to the police, I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah fokes, that was the point I got interupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but when you will hear the end of my story than buy the ""Rossall-School-magazin"", net time again, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.

995," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I'm writing back to tell you how much it made me happy to win this prize and to give you the answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because I can only see my family during the month of August. Concerning the accomodation, I prefer to live in log cabins finding them much more comfortable than tents! Finally, I decided to choose singing and basketball because my friends say I'm good at both. Singing has always been a hobby and takes an important part in my life. Singing relaxes me when I am stressed before exams or competitions. Basketball is simply my favourite sport. It makes me feel very free and makes me forget all my daily problems. I actually have won a basketball prize when I was young...! to finish off, I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping  and what kind of clothes I should take. I hope I haven't been too ""demanding"". Yours sincerely, Marthe Ouellet  [SEP]  Making a short video about daily life is an enjoyable but difficult thing to do. We would concentrate on students imagination, creation and talent. to do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes. Effectively, in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes. However, it is important to observe students attention and therefore we should film them during an exam (but only for a short period of time) A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that short shots should be taken for each subject. Students walking and talking in corridors should be filmed so that we also show how students relax between two lessons. I think these are the best advices I can give and hope that one understands the main idea which is to concentrate more on students attitudes than on lessons. ",31.0
1199," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am writing to give you some information  asked  in your letter, which I received this morning. Your group has been booked in  Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you would take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also. Regarding to the end-of-conference party, I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man, though, it is no  formal do. The party will finish quite late so we've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely. Basicaly, during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of  interesting places of London. However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos. I look forward to welcoming you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Are you always happy when your telephon ring? As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in  19th century. It has been affecting our lifes very quickly, although there were some different ways of communication as TV, for instance. Since the internet was introduced, many of us wouldn't have imagined the lifes without this. We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time. However, are you always happy when your personal phone rings. On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wouldn't have your mobile switched on. This invention has affected my life completely. Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without  internet or my mobile phone. In spite of having the opportunity of keeping  contact with friends at the time  we are far away from home, we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others. ",29.00
964," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your requests. First of all, it would be suitable for me to travel in July only, because that is when I am on holiday from work. Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be unapropriate for me. I would prefer golf and surfing. I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent to do so. About surfing, I am an amateur at it. I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships. Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take. I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there. Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerately,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert. It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began. What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him. Bye! see you soon, ",33.0
222," Dear Sir or Madam, I have seen the advertisement for the musical show and I realised that there were some mistakes. First of all, it is written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook. The show should have started t 19.30. However it started at 20.15. We  kept waiting for 45 minutes. The tickets were sold for £10, £15 and £20. We were told that the discounts were available but they were not. We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed because of the cleaning. We had expected a brilliant show but we were very disappointed. I think the people who came there should be paid back. Faithfully,  [SEP]  If we compare a person who lived a very long time ago with another one who lives now, we will see a very big difference between their clothes. People used to wear very diffrent things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that they are 'clothes'. We would probably think that these things they wore were just to cover and protect themselves. Nowadays the aim in clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves. People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes. The things that people wear are changing every time, everyone tries to be diffrent in the public and very different sorts of clothes are being created. The things we wear may not seem as if 'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now. I belive they will wear very diffrent things. ",20.0
452," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to explain how was my experience  in the theatre last Friday. I did not expect to find all the problems that I had. Firstly, I would like to say that the actor who played  was not the same one that I read  in the advertisement. Secontly, the musical show began fourty-five minutes later and nobody explained me what was happened. Thirdly, I did not receive any kind of discounts when I payed although in the advertisement it was written . After the musical show, I went to the theatre restaurant but I could not have had dinner because it was closed. I think that if the musical show will begin later the restaurant should close later, too! Finally, from my point of view, I would like to receive the money that I payed because it was not the same as you offered in the advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I think when you explain a secret you must be sure that you have chose the best person to keep it. In your life you will meet a lot of people and you should choose your friends. When I was a child my friends were my companions of class and, especially my neighbours. In the summers I always were playing with them on the street. When I was fourteen years old some things changed. I prefered going by motorbike with the people who studyied with me in the Institute. But, until you are twenty years old you choose your best friends. When you go to the university you are a person who can begin to make a good friends. You have an experience to know people and now you have an opportunaty to select good friends. You must select well if you want to have very good friends. For theses reasons, I think that you should know well the person who wants to explain a secret  and  keep it. ",24.0
65," Dear Ms. Jane Clark, I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held  21st and 22nd November. I went to the rock concert by U2 and  the Chinese film ""Chung King Express"". Both of them were not only really enjoyable, but also reasonably-priced. However, I feel that it would be even better if there were some improvement. First of all, it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities. Because most of them were from English speaking country this year. In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars. Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase. I think they are the nearest 'arts' in real life. I would be glad if you consider my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problem for students? Of course, you can't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you've born with a silver spoon. However, there are some good ways for you to earn enough money to enjoy yourself. How about working as a waiter or waitress? Not only it's a simple job, but also you can enjoy working with many colleague at your age. It would be great fan to make friends outside your class or club. If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher. It's also  really popular job among university students because of the good salaly. If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough, you'll probably become an excellent teacher. Stop complaining about  lack of money and let's start working to have a new world. You'll find that your life is becoming more and more enjoyable! ",24.00
167," Sir manager of the theatre, I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show in your theatre. With a friend we had seen your advertisement for the show, witch was very attractive. Unfortunatly, the musical show didn't go like the advertisement explained, and that wise I wont ask you  some money back. The starring had been changed, the show had started only at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside. And your last phrasal of the advertisement  ""Your perfect evening out""! it wasn't  at all, like I have explain  you above in this letter. I thank you in advance an hope for a positive requiere. Bests regards,  [SEP]  At the began of my work in a Insurance Company, I had only a old writting machine, witch makes a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with it because the switch were hard for my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, witch is very easy to use, and confortable for my fingers  also more farrster. But wen the computer don't work, I got a big problem to do my work. Also now for write a letter to a friend overland it is better with  Internet. It is so practical, in five minuts my friend can read my letter. And he can ansewer me very quickly.

797," Dear Sir, I am writing to you in reply to your letter. First of all I want to give you the thanks for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been in the USA, so I think that this travel will be an unforgetable experience. Secondly, I will like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school. In August I have to be in Madrid because I am going to work as a trainee in a travel agency. After august I must return to school, so I can only go to California in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the nature and camping, so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin. Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good in swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good in tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and which kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know the money that I have to take and which amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look foward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely, Silvia Torroja.  [SEP]  In my opinion the statement 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' is totally true. An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like. Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue  trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example. I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments you don't know what to say. In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping is boring I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment. So, shopping is not enjoyable, but necessary. ",37.0
795," Dear Miss Ryan: I received your letter about the two weeks at Camp California. I am writing back in response to your requests and because I have some questions also about those two weeks. First of all, I would rather travel in July, and if it's possible, during the first two weeks because I will be starting college at the end of the summer and therefore I have a lot of paperwork to get done. About the accomodations I would rather stay in a log cabin. I am not that much of a ""nature"" person and besides I have been feeling a little sore for the last few days and it would be better for my back than a sleeping bag. I would like to play tennis and  surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis. I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then. I couldn't say the same about surfing though I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it. And one last thing I would like to know about which kind of clothes should I take, if I have to take some money with me and if there are any expenses I have to pay at the camp. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate about writing or calling me. I will be waiting to hear from you Sincerely, Lolita A.S.  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been?

I met this guy in a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe, you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they pleased. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even took pictures with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all. Please write back. Love, Lolita. ",32.0
1006," Dear Mary, I'm really happy to hear from you! I've had so much work at school recently (exams!) and so many things to do, that I've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit. Fortunately, the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones. The boat trip you're asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you: The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours. I think such a tour is essential, because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle. After visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant, but you'd better take  picnic - it's so beautiful there! In the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake. Try windsurfing, you'll have lots of fun! I'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it. Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount. Try it and have fun! I'm looking forward to hearing from you, take care,  [SEP]  It was three o'clock in the morning when the phone rang. I rushed to answer it, but when I picked up the phone, there was nobody there. ""Stupid teenagers again"" - I thought angrily, climbing the stairs to my bedroom. Suddenly, I heard some strange sound behind me. I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound disappeared. I began feeling a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had this impression that something was wrong. I stopped and listened. Nothing. A complete silence. After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again. There was nobody . But something changed - the kitchen door was wide open. Suddenly I saw a figure of a man, dressed in black, moving towards me. I couldn't believe my own eyes, so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister's room. ""Jane"" - I shouted - ""There is a ghost downstairs! A man, dressed in a black suit!"" ""I know"" - replied my little sister peacefully, - ""It's Grandpa. Don't you know it's his birthday today?"" ""Yes, but our grandpa is dead, don't you remember?"" - I cried. ""That's right. But haven't you just said you've see a GHOST?"" - she asked and looked at me as if I had lost my mind. ",40.00
732," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you in reply to your letter about my willing the first prize in your competition. First of all, I would like to thank the jury for chosen my work from all the competitors. Next, I would like to find out some details about the camp. I need to know if my travel will take place in August. If I had known that I won, I would not have arranged my english course in Britain. Before. The next point is the accommodation. You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins. I would prefer staying in tents. I am very close to the nature, so it will be a pleasure for me. What's more, your letter said about the chance to do for two acctivities during the camp. I am very interested in tennis, but I am also very good at photography. It has been my hobby since I was a child. I have even won  competion once. That is why I would like to continue doing this at the camp. Finally, I would like to ask about other things like: clothes, money, guide. I would like to know if the ,,travel costs'' which you had paid for include entrance tickets to the museums' or any other cultural places, because I would like to  some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore, if there will be cmy tumple dryer or washing maschine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely A. Adamski.  [SEP]  Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday,  Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not. ",27.0
561," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am really surprised about the free journey to California, because I've never ever won anything before. My summer holidays last for two months, but I just have time in July. In August I am going to work in an office, so there is not possibility  to travel away this month. I would prefer the accommodation in a log cabin. For one night it would not disturb me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable. At the Camp I would like to go sailing a lot. Once my family and I went to Greece and rent a sailing boat for three weeks. Because most of the work did my parents, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat. As the second activity I have chosen to make photos. I'm used to be the photographer at the holidays with my family and I know how a camera works. Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and how much money I should estimately take with me. I just want to know, what I will have to pay  alone. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to discover a new type of landscape! Yours  [SEP]  The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found  you should take everything you like and go into the cabin. It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity. After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly. At the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are all the work worth. ",28.0
829," Dear Helen Ryan. My name is Agripina T. I just recive your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions. I would like to travel only on July because it's the only month when I'm free. On June I have to take some English lessons. I would prefer to live in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents. I don't really like living in tents. If it's possible to live in log cabins I'll be pleased. While I'm at the Camp, I would like to do two  favorite activities which are basketball and singing. I love to play basketball. I'm not good at it but I try my best. Before I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded  a lot. Also I like singing. In future I would like to be a singer. I like this kind of activity. There is something else I would like to ask. At the Camp, is there a free uniform or we will have to wear something spessial? Also I would like to ask about money. How much money should I take with me? And is it nesessary to bring money, will we need them? This is all what I wanted to ask. Thank you for everything. Yours sincerely  Agripina Tymoshenko.  [SEP]  I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons. From  activities I suggest to film sport lessons. and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always work, but us we work,  joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial. It's not true. We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math because they think that it's  boreing subject. I think it's all depends of  teacher. Our Math. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math. For activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new. We do many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are speccial. We try to play on many instruments,  sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that. Report by Agripina Tymoshenko. ",26.0
58," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to express my enjoyment that I had at the International Arts Festival the next week. Firstly, I want to say that this festival is really good and I hope it will have every year. Furthermore, the attractions were beautiful such as shows, exhibitions and concerts. I liked all the different kind of atmosphere. Also, for all these attractions, the price was low and it is important for the big family. Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous. However, I was disappointed by the number of that. It will be great if there were would have more choice the next year. I would like to give you a suggestion about the space in the concert rooms. Considering the crowded, it should have more rooms. Finally, I will be interested in meet artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists. In conclusion, I had an unforgetable time. I would like to eat some different kind of foods, if it is possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Monique, Thank you very much for your letter, I'm very happy to receive some news about you. I'm going to reply at your question. In fact, at school we haven't so many rules. So, we aren't allowed to smoke inside - and eat in the classroom. We have to wash the board when it's our turn. Of course, we must respect the teacher and do what he says. What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, then I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask at my Mum or Dad for going  by my friend after the lessons. They wanted that I did my homework before  to play. Also, I had to come back at home on time, it was very important for my parents. I want to change nothing, I was happy. Anyway, it was a great time when I was a child. It's all for now. See you soon, bye ",24.00
38," Dear Jane Clark I went  the international arts festival which you organized. Most of the events were good, but I felt that the festival could be even better next year. So, may I give you my suggestions and opinions? I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea! But the stars and artists who are from around the world were from only six countries. You had better invite more nationarities' people. And some concert halls were too small, so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films in the next year than this year's. I think the idea of one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent! Because it does not complex, also we don't confuse. If you can improve these points, your festival must be better than this year's. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Johnny Thank you for your letter. Anyway, you want to know about rules at home and school in my country, don't you? My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed  many things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes  whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom in any time . Of course we can go out  the classroom in any time. But some schools in my country don't allow many things. One of the rules of my friend's school is not to drink and eat something during a class. And the students have to wear the uniforms, so they can't chose their clothes. Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back  my house until 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule! I really want to change this rule. Many of my friends have this rule. How about in your country? Love ",26.00
496," 17th June 2000 The manager of the Circle theatre. Dear sir or madam, I am writing to you in response of your advertisement about the show of the Circle Theatre. I have to say that I am realy disappointed bout your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true. Firstly I'd like to complain about the actor of the show. On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night. Secondly another ploblem was about the starting time, according to your advertisement the play starts at 19.30 and instead it started on 20:15, this is about almost an hour delay. Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, Something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount. Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play, but the restaurant was closed and I'd like to know why. I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy  to ask for a money refund. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  The 21st Century is also known as the gold century of high technology and science. And I must admit that this is true. Many thinks have changed within the last 100 years. Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into a growing monster which doesn't have an ending. Every single day we hear about new products, new methods, new technological miracles which have turned up side down our daily lives. The simpliest example of modern high tech is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the P.C -. Reserches have shown that almost every single house owns a P.C. Some people use them for their job because they do need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun. Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the T.V, the microwave, the video the satelite , the cd player and hundreds of others. All thease play a serious role in our daily life with out  ever understanding it. All of us have turned into pathetic, technological, robots. Those things can and do make our lifes easier and more comfortable, but the call us away from our friends, our families and more over they lead us to madness and cut  any relantionship with everything that suround us and keep us in life.

76," Dear Mrs. Jane X, I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been . First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think  should be bigger for jazz, rock or still classical concerts. Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year events, such as : - Funny plays and films to spend the break time; - Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night, - Art exbitions to know  more things about  artist's lifestyle; and - talks by writers to say how good is his latest book. In addictions, the ticket's price is too expensive and  difficult to buy another one every day, so, I think  is more effective if  was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. In conclusion, I hope  will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before. Sincerely  [SEP]  How are you? It was nice to receive  notices about you. I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much. Well, about rules in my contry,  is not different than another countries. The rules must be respect for all people if you don't want get out from scholl. You must to be organise, clean and respect the right of other people.. ",12.00
104," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre   ""Over The Rainbow"". I went to see it on time as it was written  19:30 but it started t 20:15 with a delay of 45 minutes. This is nothing, it was said that Danny Brook was starring. However a different actor starred and we were all disappointed. What is more, about the tickets, discounts were not available as it was not said so. The last disappointing thing is that the theatre restaurant was closed so we could not visit it after the show. As well as you can understand I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing. Therefore, if avaliable, can you play my money back please? My address is here for any contacts, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  PAT LIKE A BLACK CAT Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He told everything that Pandora said, to everyone which Pandora didn't want them to know. Pandora had done something very bad like a robbery and one day told this to Pat because she was very shy and regretful. Pat was her best friend so she told to him. However, she didn't know that Pat couldn't keep secrets well. One day while all their friends were there and talking, Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery. All of them were schoked by what they heard. As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere. After a week of holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that every of her friends knew  that. She became very shy and engry She couldn't talk with people and she just was very sad. Finally, she couldn't wait and wear to talk to Pat. He admitted that it was his fault to say and told everyone that it was a joke to make Pandora a bit angry. After all  they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets. ",24.0

From your letter I was pleased to know that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. But could you, please, let me have more details about my award. What kind of people will be invited at your Camp in this summer? I would like to know with whome I'll share sach a wonderful days with the sport activities. About sport... I must be honest: I'm not very keen on sport. But I will be glad to  swimming and sailing for some weeks. I have been learnt to paint. And I would prefer to have a nice audience for my poetry as well, I'm a poet, yeas. I would be choose a month  July, because I'm free in this time from family's duties. What about another camp conditions - it does not matter for me. I can stay in tents or log cabins, how you wish. Sent me, please, news about July. Yours sincerely Fu-Su Harp  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope that you  still OK and now are preparing for me a new nice letter! I hope so! I have been written to you that my life in London was a little bit boring for me. It was true. But now all things became absolutly changed! I found the kind of activity what I looking for four ages. My Russian friend ivited me to set up a new exiting business. We established a firm which has a deal with musicians and contemporary pop stars. Can you imagine! First of all, in order of our firm purpose I wrote an inventation to my favorite idol - a poet and a singer Boris Grebenchekoff. We were renting for him a special hall near Piccadilly Circus. The hall was crowded. His one-week concert programme was so succsessful that we decided to invite him else, as soon as  tickets would be  sold. I had a nice expirience as manager too. I would like to be a professional in this stage, yeas. Do you share my idea, Kim? Is not it a brilliant idea? You know, Kim, I'm always looking for purpose of human being. Not only - to LIVE, but to have something to LIVE FOR. Now I did my choice. Good luck to you as well! P.S.

1196," Dear Mrs Smith I am writing to reply  your letter you wrote  me on 10 June. Firstly, I would like to tell you, that the group has been booked into  Palace Hotel, which locates beside the congress house in the centre. You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888. Secondly, the best way  from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which is specially organized by us. The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening. Off course there's also a bus number 8  in front of the hotel is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour. The end-of-conference party, which happens in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast. Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night. What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful. It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing. The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night. As you see, what to wear is just something casual. Finally, in the last afternoon, we could visit the museums, markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves. I hope your questions re answered appropriatly. I'm looking forward to seeing you on the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Computer Life Now-a-day computer can be found in almost every corner, in offices, in shops. Or even in cars and washmachines there're computer chips. What has computer affected to our life? First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait  the Kasse to take every article's note by hand. When booking a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search  it from  internet or on the local network. It's a very often heard, that someone, who has a special illness, gets  operations by a foreign institutes, which he find via  internet. Moreover, with computer network, it can be possible that people work from home, making projects, controling operations or having conferences. Lastly the way of communications has been also changed. Instead of the tranditional telecommunication, we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of  computer network. Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved. For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as  on papers. A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security. Till now, to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough. In conclusion, computer have become a very essential necessity of our life, and it's still a young invention, which need to be improved. ",27.00
468," Dear Madam/Sir, I am writing to say I am not satisfied with your musical show. Recently I am interested in musical shows, because I have never seen it in my country. When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive for me. So I went to London to see the show. As I arrived there after 5 P.M., I missed the first performance, so I decided to see the 19:30 p.m performance. However it started  20:15! Furthermore there were no student discounts! The worst one was that the actor and actress were not the person who had been written  in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed. So, I could not concentrate on the show. After the show, when I went to the restaurant it was closed, because it usually opens between afternoon and evening shows. It was a really disappointing evening! So I am asking for some money back. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully Chu Jin-Sun.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? It could be difficult to feel how many things has been changed in our daily life. But if you thought   10 years before you can easily notice. I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view, In an advantage. The modern technology is developing toward convenience for human. So, we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using  internet. How incredable it is! However  not only this advantage but also there are lots of disadvantages. Although  mobile phone is very useful  our life, it might be harmful for our brain because of micro wave it can cause the cancer or traffic accidents. In addition the side effect of artificial farm products also can't be ignored in our daily life. So I would like to say  the science and techology changed our daily life  more convenience  it also could be dangerous. ",26.0
854," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter today and I would  to thank you for the first price. The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communication firm and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. For the accommodation at camp, I prefer in the log cabins, because  few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent, it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet so for this fact, I choose the log cabins. For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming, I am in the Swimming Team and I must go two times per week to entretain me because I have  competition every weekend. My second choice, it is Basketball. I have played basketball at school and I was one of the best player after that, I decided to coach a team but I should stop because I have started  swimming competition. For these two weeks, what kind of clothes I must take? It is including the transport and travel, but for the food and extra hobbies I must take some money. Could you tell me approximatively  Your sincerely M. Bruni  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. You know last month I helped at a pop concert as like security. It was a very good experience. The concert sarted at 6:00 pm  until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear the scene with the musicians. After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and you know it was incredibale because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row. There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman. I saw old people, child.... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang, it was fantastic. If I had an other opportunity to do that I think that I will do. Write  me as soon as possible.  ",26.0
922," Dear Madam, With regard to your letter, I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible such a wonderful event as your competition is. If it was possible id prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July. In August I'll be working, so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month. About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp. My two activities chosen from the list are climbing and surfing. My skills in these activities are very different: while in climbing, this will be the first time I climb. In surfing learning won't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old. It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me. Yours sincerely Gil Sanchez  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not having written  you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting  you has been the accummulation of exams during this month. Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did you know I'm one of them? There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers. During the two hours of concert we had to attend  thirty-six people, who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! It's the best thing you can do in this case. Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon. Lots of love.

For accommodation I would rather go in a tent, I want to enjoy  wild life and admire the landscape. In relation with leisure activities, my favourites are Basketball, which I have been playing for two years because I have been selected for my University team and I think a time practising with players from different countries will help me develop my skills at  international level. Secondly, I would like to practise tennis, which is my hobby and I think it helps my mind to keep working. I would like to ask you how much money do I need, how is the weather in order to pack the necessary clothe and wheter I need something else. Yours sincerely.

I was working helping to mantle and dismantle the stage, sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something on the microphone, that was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sand in  duo with the vocalist of the group, it was such a great fun! But the most exciting part of my job, and the one that I was looking forward to, was the last night of  concert, because all the staff were promised to have a party with all the members of the band. That night was the best of my entire life. I send you some pictures, the best ones  because there were some quite embarrasing . I hope you like them and I am already waiting for your next letter.

666," Dear Helen Ryan, I'm writing to you with regard to the letter I've just received as I wish to give you some further information about myself. I would rather travel on July because I'm not as busy as on June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather. Regarding the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep  and they aren't very cozy. Regarding the activities I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, but I expect the water to be as crystal clear. I've also chosen singing. I'm an awful singer, but I would like to learn. I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very extrict vegan, and to suggest me what kind of clothes to bring. I'm really looking forward to my stay at Camp California and to your response in this regard. Yours sincerely, Nuria Valverde.  [SEP]  Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video? Well, I've just polled some students and here are their responses. 70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because  is one of the lessons they enjoy the most. The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun. 60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video  they can also have fun at school. Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring. In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because  is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it. But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows how breaks are  and what students do during them. In a nutchel I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed. Nuria Valverde. ",32.0
71," Dear J. Clark, I'm writing in response to your advertisement about the annual international arts festival. I really think it was a great idea to organize such a festival in our city as there are lots of people fond of art over here. I'm sure they are all very grateful to you now. I've already been to the festival and I think it's really important to let people see artists from all over the world. It would be wonderful if there were stars from more than six countries next year, the festival would be even more interesting then. I also think the places you have chosen for the classical concerts were not good sometimes, some of the halls seemed to be too small. But your idea about the weekend ticket is just excellent, people from the whole country get the opportunity to visit your festival and see all the events you are offering. I've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival. You could probably show a little bit more films and interviews with the most interesting artists. I'm sure it would attract lots of young people. Well, thank you very much for this festival, my friends and I have enjoyed it a lot. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Dave, Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you. Howe are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk bout our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow. Hope it will be interesting for you. Bu the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teaches don't let us smoke of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest. We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches. As for our rules at home, it's always different and depends just on your family. My parents are not very strict as you know and I appreciate them for giving me freedom. They understand that I can make my own decisions, but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother nay time we need it. I think the only rule in my house is to care bout each other. I hope to hear from you soon ",38.00
756," Dear Helen Ryan As you mentioned that I have won the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.  therefore here is the information that you require. I can travel only in July because during this month I am free to go anywhere, actually it is my summer holiday. Apart from that I wouldn't mind at all whether  to stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because it gives me a nice feeling and relaxation, it is very unusal for me to stay in log cabins while you are camping. The activities that I'd like to do: First one it would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well due to I used to be a basketball player in my high school. Second activity it would be tennis, I am not the expert in this one because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like ; serve the ball, back hand and fore hand to hit the ball. Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one tents? Do I have to bring swimming suit if I want to swim in the camp? How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay ? This information should  enough for you but if you'd like to know more about anything please ask me and do not hesitate. I'm looking forward to it and I hope seeing you during this summer. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Sometime when you ask your friend especially girls. What would you like to  after the class or during the weekend? The typical answer would be 'I'm going to  shop because I like it even windows shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it's wasting my time especially when I can't find the thing I want, this is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all  your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime. However shopping is not a bad thing, only if you plan it carefully what to buy, where to go, how much money you will spend on? ",25.0
590," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for informing that I won the prize. I was very pleased to hear that. I am writing to inform you the information you asked me . As for the date to travel, I would like to go there in July. Owing toe the summer course I take starting in August, July is the only month I have free time. With regard to  place to stay, I would be most grateful if I could stay in a log cabin. I never could sleep in a tent in my life. I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities. Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some picture of beautiful scenaries in California. As photography, swimming is my best way of relaxation. It would be grateful if I could go swimming during the stays. Finally, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take there, and how much money I would need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although shopping is one of the most popular ways to reduce your stress, this is not always the case. There are some negative points that I would like to make about shopping. First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is looking around all  shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't find ones!! That's would be so exhausting. Next thing you have to do is trying them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms. After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted clothes taking off and putting on. That's a hell!! That's not the end of the story. You need to go home with bulky bags in both of your hands!! To sum up, although there is certainly a good side of shopping, such as  pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for  long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.

749," Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you for your information. I am very happy to win this prize but also I have some questions about this Camp. I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this Camp on July because for me it is the best time and I can not travel before or after  according to my employer. While this two weeks I would like to stay in  tents because you can be nearer to the nature as you are on  log cabins. I like to go camping. From the activities I choose Basketball and Golf. In Basketball I am very good, because I have played in a Basketball-Team for ten years. But in Golf I am a beginner. I would like to know if it is necessary for me to take some clothes with me for the sport activities? Also I would like to know how much money I should take with me. If you could tell me this answers it would be very nice. Yours sincerely Aydo Ackermann  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good . For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest things like bread and other things to eat. I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes. Also a problem while the shopping is that most  there are so many people and a lot of traffic in all  shopping-centres. All the people are there most on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities for shopping while the week for the employees. I think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet, because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things, and they bring you the things at  home In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.

662," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very surprise, to won this prize. About the information, I  like to travel on July because it's only the month  I have  vacation. It's very difficult to change it. About the accommodation at Camp California I will prefer tents because I like the nature and I like to listen  the birds. At the camp I will like to practise tennis and golf. My level in this two activities is medium, I never practise them all. I would like to ask you some question. How many money take us? or is necessary? What can of clothes met it? In the first prize you including a second person like my husband? It's necessary for the activities to wear special clothes? Thank you another time for this first prize  two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I'm very happy. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Last weekend I went to Barcelona with some friends to shop. When we arrived to the shopping center, I saw a lot of people. I don't understand why they was a lot of people. My friends and I, I went to a fashion shop  ""Mango""  to buy some clothes. Nobody at the shop came with us to help. There are four gays, in this shop. We asked them if someone of them  help us. Finally, a girl very friendly came with us. We bought some trousers, tee-shirts, and one pair of shoes. My friends bought some things like a red trousers and white tee-shirts. After this, we returned to Andorra. But not always it's the same history because I like shopping and I think I'm enjoy. Not all the time the people are not friendly in the shops.  ",20.0
523," Dear Sir! I am writing with reference to your theatre. I would like to apologise  you for my controversary opinnion but I feel really disappointed. Firstly I would like to explain  you where the problem is. I came to London for a short journey to meet new poeple and to have a meeting with an English culture. I've seen your advertisment which had recommended the play 'Over the rainbow' and I enjoyed it very much. I decided to go to the Circle Theatre with  hope that your show will provide me  all these emotions that I have been looking for in Great Britain. Please forgive me but you didn't do your best. I heard about Danny Brook in Poland and I wanted to see him on the scene but it wasn't hardly possible. There was a change of the leader-actor what annoyed me indeed. Further more the show was to begin at about 19.30 but it didin't. You were 45 minutes late. Waiting was horrible. On the advertisment was written 'DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE' shall I ask you one question? - Why they weren't available? Everybody were schocked and I was trying to keep the faith. I didin't expect more surprises at your Theatre. Nevertheless after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant and what  I've seen? A poster: ""Closed because of the illness of the chef."" There were some more disappointing situations about which I don't want to write. Eventually - you offered a wonderflul evening but I must say that if I had known that it is going to be like that I wouldn't have wasted my time. I feel honoured to write this letter and I feel the oportunity. I would like to recieve back my money. I am looking forward to hearing you from you. Your faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main adventage is that, it provides you  all the informations that you need. For example you have to write an Essay about  2-nd world war. You get into the internet and you're looking for those facts and informations which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Further more you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly this advantage has especially changed my life. Playing the games takes me a lot of time and it became a bad habit. I have no time for learning and for domestic works. On the other hand playing games and using a computer wide my brain so as you can see this modern staft has got many advantages and disadvantages. The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful either. I have got a steady contact with my parents and friends. I have no problems with changing the time of  meeting because I can always phone. But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation. The modern technologies brought to my life a lot of changes. It is even seen in the domestic works. For example I've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons hardly itself. My mother is happy and I am happier because I don't need to put an effort to iron the clothes. I only press the button and everything is going alright. These are the main reasons why I admit that technology has changed my life and other people's life. I admire  people who made those machines and I would like to give them the tribute. They made my life better. ",26.0
276," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you to show the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and the real life. When I saw your advertisement on yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement. But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time. I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose seeing Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage. Moreover it was written  that the musical was between 14:30-19:30. Suprisingly the show started at 20:15. That destroyed all my plans. Then I decided to have a dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed. I think, all of these disappointments are too much for one evening. After all I am sure that you understood it wasn't my perfect evening out and you will give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing your good news  Sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That was also my fault. I don't know why I told this to Pat. But I thought Pat and I were best friends. Yesterday Larry suggested going to  cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to  cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted immidiately. I was like walking on the clouds  the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I promised Pat to help her with her history homework. She came near to me and said ""Ready for this evening? Don't forget bringing your history books."" She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I want to tell her something. Then I explained what has happened that morning. She was about to cry. ""I see. You choose Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend."" After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell this anyone. She said OK angrily. After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told  that I promised my Mom to be with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my bedroom's door I burst into tears. I don't know how long I cried... Next morning I went to school again. Everyone at the school was knowing about my love to Larry including him. Pat was the only person who knew  it. That showed me not to trust anyone. ",24.0
21," Dear Ms Clark, I write you this letter because I want to tell you  my experiences of the festival. I have spent two days at the ""International Arts Festival"" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time. For example, on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries. That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small offer; I hope it will be larger the next time. But do not worry! There have also taken place very good attractions like  dance shows, the art exhibition and listening to  talks  by writers, The reasonably-priced weekend ticket was a very good idea. This was a clever way to attract people's attention At last, I would like suggest a ""pony-ride"" for children, to attract families. Please tell my your opinion about this. Best regards  [SEP]  I think there are some possibilities for earning money. I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils, for example,  maths or english. There are also some schools which offer such a job. To teach pupils is not easy, of course. But I think that after some lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff. So it would be easier for the teacher ! It is also not a dirty work, I mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people! And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers if you are working in a shop. To be a good teacher you especially need patient and good nerves! Not everybody has the ability to understand everything at once. And the money you get is not less So, if you like to b with people and help them and if you have  talent to explain  good then it would be the best, if you offer your help to the people! ",25.00
791," 13.6.00 Dear Hellen, Thank you very much for your letter that I received yesterday. I am very happy that I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at camp California in  USA. Also I am pleased, that I don't have to pay any expenses. I would like to travel  end of July. In June I have other arrangements, such as my school exams and my birthday. It is convenient for me the last two weeks of July. After my school exams I will have time to prepare myself for the trip. In your letter you are asking me to chose which  accomodation I prefer. I would like very much to stay in  tents. Last year I stay in  tents with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it. Summer time the weather is good and I don't see  any problem  anywhere I will stay. During my time in California, I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming. It is my favourite sport. I am good and fast at swimming. Another sport I love is basket ball. Hopefull I will meet some other girls  in the same sport. So we all play as a team. My final question is this. Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks. Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need. Please write soon Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. As a housewife I have a good idea about it. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go two days We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not. I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday  is not the same. Shops are so crowded and it takes  long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we got to face a long queue in order to pay. Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people. I find it very tiring sometimes. Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually much more money we spend than we expect. We can't do anything about is. We have to face it - it has both sides. Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday. ",29.0
258," Dear Manager, My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, wich took place in your stablishment, The Circle Theater, that made me feel very upset. First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very exited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began. I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne, the show must begin on time, but it started forty five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seeing before, and the restaurant was closed with no advise. At last, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible. Yours Sincerelly,  [SEP]  In our days, technology has become a very common thing, even among children. It is such an evolution for  human race, however we can not forget that it can cause some problems too. Firstly, the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade, with the devellopment of telephones, radio stations, television and even satelites, and of course, the internet, gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this provided health and education researches to increase as well. In the other hand, technology has made the differences between - poor and rich people to grow at a high level, and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries. I addition to that, people will always be affraid of the technological war. In conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a  new area to explore, we have to use it with a great amount of responsability, for us all to survive in the future.

747," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter that I have just received. I am very happy to win first prize in your competition. - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am also very excited about it. If it is possible I would like to travel in July. This is the only month that I will be free. Because I am studying the Management and Finance at university and it will finish at the end of June. I will be in italy in August. Because I need to improve my italian and I am taking a very important exam next year. I would be appreciate it if I could stay in  tents at  Camp. Because I usually go on camping-site holiday, with my friends. It is great fun. I really like staying in tents. It is also written in your letter that we will have to  chance to do two activities. I am really good at playing tennis and singing. I have been playing tennis for five years and I love it. I play the classicial guitar and I also sing songs. I have been playing the classicial guitar for three years. It is quite difficult but I like difficult things. I wonder if you could tell me about the wheather and what kind of clothes I have to bring with me. I would also like to know how much money I need. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING Why do people like shopping? First answer is that they need  shopping. Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel  going shopping. When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but  if it is possible to do  shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for. I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time. If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really  good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time. Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad  situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argument with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because she never managed to get me out from the toy shop. As you see shopping is not always enjoyable. Always make sure that  is  right time to go shopping. ",34.0

About your request, I'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need, however you can call me if you consider it necessary, (my phone number is 2496 9731). Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. Because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it. Moreover, it is really well-located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem. Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre, which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel. We haven't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes, although you can come well-dressed, if you feel better . After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce  each others. Finally in my opinion, you should visit the Art Gallery. It will take you two or three hours but it's a gorgeous place. I look forward  hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Sagrada Familia"" a real holly building. If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona, which you can like whatever your tastes are, you should visit the ""Sagrada Familia"". Among the big number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art. Gaudi conceived  this church n 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it. Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again. After Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later. Nowadays, a hard work is being done in order to finish  as soon as possible. The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit. There is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted. And, unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top. There you can enjoy a terrific view, not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building. ",34.00
530," June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing this letter to show whom disappointed am I with the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"". First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared. When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but  started at a quarter past eight. Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for  discount but they weren't available. When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed. So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born. When I wake up I take a shower using eletricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus, when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave than I watch t.v. and do my homework using a pen, when I come back from jiu-jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed. About a millenium ago every thing was different the people didn't have electricity, they did their food on the fire and they didn't have pens. Comparing these too realities the reader can notice that modern technology changed very much our daily life. ",27.0
1139," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to your advertisement which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction to your article. First of all, your advertisement mentions that the course had to be cancelled, because the teacher was ill, but the course cancelled only  the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that no body registered for the local history course. So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses   is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for being these courses so popular is that people are very interested in these kind of activities. Apart from this the teachers was very experienced and the equipment was particullarly coteporary. Furthemore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention. Finaly, I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention bud I would like to thank you for you kind attention to my letter, and I would like you to write another article which will lit to the truth Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, I am very happy because I haven't received any letter from you, for  long time, and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not  serious , I didn't write to you. I hope you are fine. First of all, you musn't panic. It's not  serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs. In my opinion as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant. If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you. You'd  better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum  include big tips from the tourists. Apart from these, despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole  next year, if you are lucky. Last but not last, I hope you will find my opinion helpful I wish your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's about a problem. Whatever choice you will make I'm sure it will be the best for you. Drop me a line. Lots of Love, ",34.0
434," For the attention to the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were invited to the estatement were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing on his performance. In addition, the event was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we  were able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to the Chef who leaded the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts for the tickets would be available, but it was not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization of the theatre bring  my money back. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and she told her mother what had happened during the concert. Peter had a terribly problem with drugs. He started to consum the stuff at the age of twenty. He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down to Australia, but Peter was used to live in New York,  overcrowded and  surronded by people. Australia is a country too calm for him. We invited him to enjoy the concert of Texas but he started to make nonsenses because of the drugs. Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert. A security guard saw it and put his attention on him. Pat stared at him and asked for help. The security guard heard her and agreeded with Pat that if Peter continued acting on this way he would obliged us to go out of the concert. He did it. When we arrived at home, Pat told to his mother what had happened. ",24.0
412," 17/6/00 Dear Sir/Madam I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said  on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged  adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other actor  I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment for my whole family, infact all the viewers where very dissappointed. Anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be, I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do you know, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems whatsoever. they even gave us a table number. What kind of an organasation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund. Thankyou for your time and attention Yours Sincerely.   [SEP]  The Revealed Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact he was one of the main busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not alot of people in his school liked him. this was a vary bad thing about Pat's school and also for Pat. Another bad thing about this school was that there where different types of students that formed groups. Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously, maby just a bit too seriously, they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers of other gang, trying to start fights with them. This whent on and on, got more and more serious but it was so secret that  teachers didn't notice. One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly to keep it a secret especially from the other groups. But Pat was so exited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. and the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it. exept a few phcyco groups, some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannes of it. That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses where working. Everyone was drunk and they simply would not let him go. Time was ticking away. he new the attack was coming anyminute. now, The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and where ready to strike. They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready. they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they could. they all exploded with loud splashes. The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns. Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school, when the Headmaster found out what had happened. Pat recieved no punishment at all and he wasn't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends. But he felt awfull because he new that all this had happened because of him. ",31.0
290," MR. MANAGER, I'M WRITING  YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" WICH WAS PRESENTED LAST WEEK. YOUR ADVERTISING LEAFLET WAS COMPLETELY WRONG, IT SAID THAT DANNY BROOK WAS ACTING BUT, WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY ON STAGE. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING, SPECIALLY FOR ME WHO IS A GREAT FAN OF DENNY. THAT'S NOT ALL! IT STARTED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE RIGHT TIME AND WE HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE THEATRE. THE TICKETS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISCOUNTS BUT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING  TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE WRONG, THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DISCOUNTS TO ANYONE. AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED ON THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS. I'VE NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS. FOR ALL THIS REASONS MY EVENING WAS TERRIBLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST PART OF MY MONEY BACK. YOURS SINCEARLY  [SEP]  SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER, JUST AS EXAMPLE,  INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR LIFE IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT. IN MY CASE, I'M COMPLETELY INTEGRATED WITH THEM,  ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO I USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS, WRITE, LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND, NOWADAYS, YOU CAN DO ALL THIS THINGS USING A COMPUTER. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS THAT MEN INVENTED IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO LOT'S OF THINGS AND TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO USING A PC. MOST OF MY DAY I SPEND IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, STUDYING, RESEARCHING, PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO IT'S BAD ASPECT, IT MAKES YOU MORE FAR FROM PEOPLE,  ISOLATED FROM TRUE RELATIONSHIPS BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT WHEN YOU GOT USED TO THIS. ",31.0
374," AUTHORITIES OF THE CIRCLE THEATRE: I'M WRITING  YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK, WHEN I WENT TO THE CIRCLE THEATRE AND I SAW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. FIRST OF ALL, IN YOUR ADVERTISMENT  SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM  ANYWHERE. SECONDLY...THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT: FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES LATE. WHEN IT STARTED I COULD SEE THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T IN THE PLAY, AND NOBODY TOLD US WHY. THE ACTOR WHO WAS ACTING HIS PART IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN, REALLY TERRIBLE. HE HAD BEEN IN A PLAY BEFORE? I DON'T THINK SO.... FINALLY, WHEN THE PLAY FINISHED, WE WENT TO THE THEATRE RESTAURANT TO HAVE DINNER BUT IT WAS CLOSED. I DON'T KNOW THE REASON ... AS YOU CAN SEE IT WASN'T A ""PERFECT EVENING"". I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A COMPLETE REFOUND. MY ADRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE. YOURS SINCERELY.

IN  FEW DAYS MARIA'S FATHER (WHO IS VERY JEALOUS) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR. HE ASKED MARIA IF IT WAS TRUE AND SHE COULDN'T LIE. HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA GOING OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS. MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN  HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND. MARIA MET TIM AT NIGHT, WHEN HER FATHER WAS SLEEPING.

748," 13 june 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am so pleased with the news. I'd like to tell you that the best month  to travel to the U.S.A is on july because I will be on hollidays in this month. I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can tell you wich one I prefer I'll choose  in  tent. This is because  is more exciting and fun than not in log cabins. From the list of activities to do at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming. I used to go to a swimming pool twice every week and also I love music and sing all the time. I'd like to ask you about how much money I'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july. I am looking  to hear  you very soon. Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you doing? I am so glad to know that you and your family  still well. I am writing to you to explain what I did last month at a pop concert. It was great, believe me! I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy, a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the Club and we put it on the stage. After this, we helped to the service bar to put into the fridges all  drinks and refreshments. And that was it! I enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marevellous! Well Kim, I hope to see you soon and take care. Love ",29.0
889," Dear Miss Ryan,  I am writing in reply to your letter, informing me that I have won the prize in your competition which is two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am really pleased to hear that the prize includes accommodation. I would like to stay in a tent, because I have been camping nearly every summer since my childhood and I really love it. I would be really happy if I could apply Singing and Photography as the activities you have written about. Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5. I could say that I am quite good at it. However, I used to assist my brother, who is a profecional photographer. So that, I consider myself expirienced enough. I would like to ask you whether going there in July is possible. I am afraid that July is the only appropriate month, because I am due to start work in August. Finally, I would like to ask you for further information about  spending allowance and the clothes which I am supposed to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry I haven't written for so long. But I've been quite busy just recently. Last month, I helped  at a pop concert which I really enjoyed. The singer, who took place, wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being  stuff there, was just amazing. I was just behind the stage. I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so that I could see all that screaming like made crowd. I even saw crying girls, who were trying to reach the pop-singer. Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly . I think you never realize this, until you're not a part of the crowd. But I'm really happy, that I had even  small role in making people enjoying themselves. I mean, all that flashing lights,  the changing colours of them, I believe they helped much. Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself being very successful. And finally, the greatest news. I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there. He was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit his signature on it. I suppose, I will never forget that night. That's about all my news, I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Lots of love, ",36.0
4," Dear Jane Clark, the organiser of  International Arts Festival I'm one of the citizen that enjoyed the last International Arts Festival. Most of  attractions are excellent, but I'd like to point out that  ""quality is high, but  quantity is not enough!. First of all, the only ""six countries"" doesn't mean ""around the world"". I suppose you had difficulty to manage the schedule. Second, some concert hall were too small, so some  audience couldn't concentrate  to listen to the music. And others couldn't enter the hall. But  ""All in one ticket"" was a good idea. In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is  wasting  time. I pressume if the term becomes longer the festival become more excellent. Because it's easy to manage the artist schedule and  audience can enjoy the live. I'd like to go to the Festival again!  [SEP]  Thank you for your letter. And I'd like to answer for your question. AT first, in Japan, generally school rules are more strictly than  home's. The gap between them is tremendously big! I can say the action which is prohibitted at school is no problem at home. Because the purpose of school rules is not only  discipline but also unify. Here, I write down one of the rules at my school. ""Whenever the students wear an extra  cloth (because of  cold or something) his or her (not  students!) parents write down an application form with their authorized signatures"". You will ask me why, the reason is the above...""unify"". In addition ""the students must not use any commercial paper bags (received at  department store etc)"". Now you know the reason! Needless to say I'd like to change such ridiculous rules, because such rules are not for us. They are for teachers'! Don't you think so? Do you have any rules at school that make you upset? If you have please tell me. Yours faithfully ",22.00
680," Geneva, 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you a lot for your kind letter. I was very surprised on the result of the competition. Now I am happy to give you all the information you need. I think it would be better for me to travel on July. I will started an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave . In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins, well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals. I saw, you offer a lot of activities, that'is fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like  and I can also do the best. I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well. The other activity I like very muche is swimming. I took part at a lot of competitions. Now I would like to ask you if wee need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes. I hope I have give to you all the information you needed and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely B. Müller  [SEP]  Geneva, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim I am happy to tell you about the experience I made at the pop concert last month. I had to start very early in the morning, at 7.30. We first had to prapare the stands with food and drinks and buy something which had been forgotten. Then we had to put on the night lights and decorate the whole room. In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin. I was very excited! He is very beatiful! At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert. I logically accepted. The interview I liked particularly Before the concert started, we had to  verify all  music instruments. The microphones all had to be controlled. Fortunatly we had no problem. The concert was a success. I was very proude of me and the work I had done. After  concert I left with Ricky Martin. We went to a nice restaurant and enjoyed dinner together. I am sure my dear Kim, I will never forget that wonderful experience. Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit of your adventure or experience you had in last time. lot of kisses your friend BM ",31.0
685," 8 Jun 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Sir At the begining I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much. I have always dreamt about holidays 'in Camp California' However there are some problems that I hope to solve. First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July. It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down. If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to the nature. I would like You to know also about my two hobbys: swimming and surfing. I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at 'Camp California'. There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about. The question is: Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip? Yours sincerely Anna Nowak  [SEP]  Unconected part of every people lifes is shopping. We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money. As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like  flaing. Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I ought to do is buy and choose. I think that ,,having is a dream'' of all of us. It's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you can't have it. Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present. Everybody know that ,,present presents a problem'' You know your own task but what vith a task of the other person? However I can't agree with  opinion that ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable'' I think that everybody like to buy but not everybody like to see pleasure in it. ",28.0
993," Dear Mr. Ryan, I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two weeks travel to Camp California. I will give you some information which helps you to know me better. I would like to travel to  camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you. I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel. About accommodation, I think tents would be great. Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children. Basketball will help  children to build team character and leadership . And swimming is very good for  health. I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player. I count on my experience. And there are  few questions I would like to ask. First, what clothes should I take with me, secondly. how much money and  by cash or by travel cards. Thanks! I am looking forward to our meeting. Yours sincerely, Vasiliy Alekseyev.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I enjoyed helping at  concert of ""Modern Talking'' and now I want to share with you about my experience. It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favorite band. And what do you think I answered? Of course, yes! I have got very responsible work I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders. Can you imagine? I came into their room and give hot Cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter. It was the happiest moment of my life. He asked me was the cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was. I was very nervous talking with him. He told me about  concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign. I will never forget that summer day. It was my day, I am sure about it. Well, I think that is all. See you. Yours faithfully, Vasiliy. ",27.0
320," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show that I saw in your theatre. First of all, Danny Brook was supposed to act there, but he was replaced by another actor. This situation made me feel very disappointed. Secondly, the show should have started at 19:30 p.m., and it began fourty-five minutes later. Moreover, when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable. Furthermore, I wanted to have a coffe after the show, but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant, it was closed. A police officer who was there told me that the manager of the restaurant was ill and that he didn't allowed anyone to open it. This was the worst night that I had during my stay in London. For all that reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money back to my house. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her school's class-matters were going to give their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise to her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden of Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That day afternoon they arrived at Paula's house in order to decorate the place. Ballons and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of delightful food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later all the things were finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they had been planned. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this. ",31.0
849," 13th June, 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I recived your letter and I am very excited about the camp. I would like to go in July I don't mind wich two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I  still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it's different from where I sleep every night so I would apreciate it if there are still tents available. One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing, I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better in it. The other activity I would like to take is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years. I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take  money with me. Thanks for your attentions. Yours sincerely, Ma. Anni Soler  [SEP]  13th June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hello girl how are you doing this days. I am great especially last weekend in the concert of Backstreet Boys. It was so exciting. They were giving two concerts one in Friday and the other one in Saturday they invited me to go on friday. This is what happened: when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery, then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the courtines (opening and closing) when Nick came  to me and ask me to go on stage with him, my heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day. Well I have to go now. Hope to hear from you later on. Love, Anni. ",31.0
228," Dear Sir, I'm writing to you inform you about the dissapointing evening I had when I went to your theather to see the play called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". According to the advertisement you gave, there  have been some important differents . Firstly, the play started almost an hour late, and I went there to see Danny Brook, but there was a different actor on stage. Secondly, in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays. In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there. I would be grateful if you  do it. Finally, I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers. If you do it, there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them. I look fordwad to hearing from you Your sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology change my daily life? Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have. It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it. In this case we are going to focus on me. Emilio Almodar, 18 years old, University Student, and the career I have choosen is  Internacional Commerce or Market. I use technology every moment but I did not realise. For example, when I come back home from university and I call my friends, I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and  fax  and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that. We also have five computer, the latest versions of them, because they are useful for my father to work  and for me to do some special works for University. This machines are connected to  Internet, and it gives to my family too much facility to get  every  information we want, from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday's football match. In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in  U.S.A. It's really amazing. Apart from this, I don't spent my free time in technology. I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends, because technology is not all  life, but it is only a little part of it. ",25.0
668," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply to your letter. I'm very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition. Here there are the informations you require. First of all, I'm available for travel only in July because in August I'm going to attend a language course in France. As far as accomodation is concerned I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable, and, therefore, I have never stayed in a tent. The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis. I play basketball very well, although I have never taken part in important competitions; however, I am not very good at tennis, and I would like to improve it. Moreover I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money I have to take, and which clothes are better to be put on during the holiday. Yours sincerely Rita Pizzi  [SEP]  This report shows which lessons and activities are better to be filmed in order to make a short video about daily life at our school. It is based on interviews taken from over 80% of my classmates. First of all, according to the majority of them, latin and greek lessons should be filmed. In fact they find it difficult to take them in and, in their opinion, these lessons are the most important so as to show their daily life at school. On the other hand, about 3% of students suggest that also chemistry lessons should be filmed, because they often take place in the laboratory that the school has lately built; in fact some experiments might be filmed. Furthermore, some students would like to film the football school team, because football is the most practised activity by the students. To sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern their sportif activities as well. ",34.0
696," Dear Mrs Ryan Many thanks for your letter. I would like to travel in July because I have got  summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August. I think a tent would suit my personal life-style better than a log cabin because I love the nature. I would like to play basketball during my holidays at Camp California because I love this game. I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball-team. But I have never played golf in my life but with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting. I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experience I made. At first I had to clean the three private rooms of the stars. This was very boring but after I left the third room I met Brunner and Brunner. These two people are stars in our country... O.K. I am just kiding. I don't like the songs of Brunner and Brunner because this kind of music is very boring. I also had to clean the washing rooms. I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert . But after this serville work I met Eminem. I think you know his popular songs like ""My Name Is"". It was one of the greatest moments in my life. I had to bring him something to eat. It was a hard but also a funny work. You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. ",30.0
509," Dear Mr. Smith: I am writting in order to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"". At first, the advertisement said that the show was starring by Tina Truelove and Danny Brook, that was not true, Danny Brook did not act in the show, it was a different actor and I got disappointed with him. In order to the times , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary. Another thing, the tickets. The advertisement said that there were discounts available, that was false, there were not any kind of discounts. After all  I just wanted to go to the restaurant of the theatre and have something to eat, but it was closed because the police had closed it. They had closed it because they had found the food in  bad conditions. Just to finish, the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out, let me tell  that it wasn't not. I paid  a full ticket without discounts to wait 45 minutes, to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all  could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed. I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do it. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Technology. The technology has changed, is changing and it will change our daily lifes. Technology is improving every day, soon everything will be done by a machine. Now we can cook in a easier way than ten years before, we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what's happening in the other part of the world. Another thing  is changing our life is the computer, especially  Internet. More and more people are connecting through the net. Soon we won't need to get out from our homes. Now we can buy everything by  Internet, we can see what's happening in Wall Street, we can send mail in a easier way, by e-mail and many people has started to work at home by their computers. Technology has changed so much our daily lifes that we won't be able to live without it. Nobody can imagine to live without a T.V., a computer, a microwave, a telephone. There are machines for everything, to write, to cook, to go from one place to other, to talk with somebody who is not with you. Our lifes are very different from our grandparent's lifes and that's because  the technology. ",31.0
594," Mrs/Miss Helen: Thank you very much for your letter. It is excellent to have won this prize. To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of I think I did well, I had to play against a very strong competence. The idea about going to California for 2 weeks make me feel very excited. According with your letter, July is the period of time  suits me best. My job is less demanding in July. About the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a tent. I have never done it before, so I really fancy the idea. I am really surprise about how many activities can be practised in this place. If  is possible I would like swimming. I am very good at swimming. On one hand I think that climbing sounds very exciting, but on the other hand it scares me a lot, so I will play tennis. I am not so bad at tennis but I would like to improve my style. By the way, I would like to know if the level of life in  USA is similar to  UK. How much money should I bring with me? Another point is about the clothes, could you confirm me that I'll need summer clothes? I would be very pleased . Please if you need further information from me, don't hesitate to contact me again. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Normally I enjoy really much shopping. In fact when I don't feel very happy I decide to do shopping to try to cher myself up. And really, it works. But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate  when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like  when I have to try on differents sizes because the small  doesn't fit on my body because I have got weight. It is in this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling. I think women, in general, are very impulsive  purchasing things. Many times we buy things that in fact, we don't need and, sometimes you  surprise when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down  your expenses for 2 months. But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and don't spend it as you want. At the end of the day money is just money. ",32.0
819," Dear Helen Ryan, First at all, I'd like to thanks  for the prize  Won. I'd like to know  USA. this prize came in a good time. I'd like to travell in july because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For it the only one that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabins because I can't bear sleeping in a tent, I hate this kind of accomodation. But I love sports. I'd like to play Tennis and  swimming these are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better  I can swim, because since I was I child I've been practising it. I've already Won three prizes about it. And I'd like to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too. I've never gone to  USA before. I hope I will have a good journey. Yours Sincerely, ALBiTO.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. We had a class discussion about shopping, for it I'm writing to tell about my opinion. I love shopping mainly when I am alone on when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax. When I  got plenty of money sometimes I like spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girl friend. But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and  sad  is not a good idea to go to shopping. Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like more and shoes I love new shoes. One good idea  to go to shopping is when you  got plenty of money. ALBiTO ",28.0
703," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter. First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. It is very important for me, because I  always wanted to travel to the U.S.A. I would be able to travel only in July because it is the only month when I don't have to go to school. I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent, it would be a new experience for me. The two activities that I choose are: basketball and climbing. I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old. By the other side, I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it. I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take. I look forward to knowing the date of the camp. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it. As you know, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it. First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs. When the concert was finished, some friends and I went for a drink. It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, ",30.0
1020," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you as a representative of the class about the 3-day school trip which has been organized for next week. First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organization of this trip which seems to be very interesting and useful for the students. Especially I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us. All the students are enthusiastic about it. However, some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March. The Exhibition will show all the latest fashion in a very wide range from sports wear to make up and even hairstyles. What is more, the show is free for all the students. We feel that taking part to it would be a great opportunity to us since we will be able to have some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our days. Under the circumstances, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition. It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm, so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon. I hope you will consider this possibility and tell us as soon as possible if you intend to accept our proposal. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes. But not always famous people are happy of their condition. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: ""I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do"" There is no surprise to this answer: famous people can not have their own private life. Whenever they go out they are suddenly ""hounded"" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph. But the worst thing of all is that they are often  victim of malicious gossips, which most of the times are not even true. In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings, on the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed: not always, in fact, money and celebrity being happiness. ",34.00
1011," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am a student of the FCE class and I am writing to you in name of my class to thank you for the programme about the three days trip to London that you have prepared for us. We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery. Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March. We would like to go to this show. There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear . In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles. We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion. For these reasons I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday's afternoon. You can give the possibility to the students too choose between go shopping or go to the show. The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be opened until 7. pm. It is even free for students!! I hope that this change will not cause to you too many problems. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I agree with this statement. I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time. A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed. In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far. For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death. On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous. The famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work. In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday. In conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media.

851," Dear Madam, At first, I want to say how I am happy to have won this prize and I want to thank you. Concerning the information you want I will give them. I would like to travel on July because this is the only month  given to me by my employer. I would prefer to have a log cabin because I can not sleep in a tent (it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back). Concerning the two activities I have to choose, I would prefer to swim and play tennis (I have a good level  in each sports). Finally I would like to know how much money I have to prepare and which sorts of clothes are usually weared in California. Yours faithfully Pablo Fernandez  [SEP]  Many classes and activities are important in our school But I have to make a choice in order to select  them The class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson. It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes. It gives us the knowledge  usefull for many school club like the ""marathon shell"" club or the robotich club. Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer. But there are other lessons very important (like English of course!) Actually, I have a regret, there is no ethic lessons, It would show us how use our knowledge. ",23.0
315," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" I went to see at your theatre in London two weeks ago. According to your advertisement, Danny Brook was involved in the show, but to my disappointment there was a different actor. To make things worse, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Besides, there was a problem with tickets. According to the advertisement, discounts were available, but in reality it wasn't so! On top of everything, when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, it turned out to be closed. When I insisted on the explanation of this fact, I was told that the chief cook was on holiday! The perfect evening out you promised to provide turned  to be really boring and disappointing. In connection with this I think you should give me some money back. I hope you will  note  this and I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my classmate and I should add, that he was one of my best friends. I loved and respected him very much, but there was an unpleasant thing about him - he talked too much. My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising to her, because she could hardly ever think of such a present. We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the holiday probably even more impatiently, than Susie. But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret. He told her about the present as soon as he saw her. I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited, that he couldn't act in a different way. Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but  friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending. ",35.0
892," June, the 13th 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, You can guess how an enjoyable surprise receiving your letter was for me. I am glad to send you the items required. First of all, I must precise that I can only leave during the month of July owing to the job I obtained for August. After considering your accomodation offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible. I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping, however I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort two weeks long. Moreover, I must recognize that the activities offered are really attractive so it's hard to make up my mind. On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during  leisure times. Even if the photograph made are modest work, I am really interested in this activity. Then, as low  my level of   basketball is, I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time. So it will be pleasant for me to practice this activity. Your letter indicates that the pride includes that some costs are paid. Nevertheless I would like you to precise what I eventually need for this travel. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What obviously appears about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes. Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times that make our life. To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown at first. It evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché; that can not lack. A philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it. Next, students during the pause in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with   the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video. Furthermore two moments could have a role. First of all, the arrive of every students, namely the picture of the school without anybody at first, and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life. Then, the opposite situation, that is to say the scene of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make a parallel. ",25.0
210," 17-6-00 Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to complain about the musical show: Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June. I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out. I could not understand why but  still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished. At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning. I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement. I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having such kind of mum. I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologise for thousands of times. A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did . However, they are equal important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said with a loud voice. 'If there were no cleaner, who would clean the school for us, who would keep the environment nice and tidy.' Suddenly, all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All the jobs have the same importance.'

619,"  Dear Ms Helen Ryan I am writing this letter as an answer to your request for some further information from me. I would like to travel in July, because I have recently got a new job, which I am going to start in August. Therefore, July is my last free month until much later. I would prefer to stay in a tent during the camp, as I find tents a lot more exciting than log cabins. I am a very good swimmer, so I choose swimming from the activities you listed. I am also very keen on climbing, although I am not extremely good at it. I would also like to ask how much money I am supposed to take with me and I would be glad if you could give me an answer before the camp begins. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Bibiana Krol  [SEP]  Most people enjoy shopping. But not me. I think shopping is hard, exhausting work, especially when you are trying to buy yourself some new clothes. The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you. Eventually, after long seeking you find a skirt you like. But it doesn't fit. You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one. And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams. And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop. Accident like that can really make you livid. At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town. You phone your friend to visit you and your friend come, wearing the skirt not unlike the one you have just bought. But that's the life. You can always go and buy a new one. ",34.0
957," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thanks for your letter. I have reading the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize. About the time when I like to travel is only July, because in the summer is it very busy at work. People where I working with they are going on holiday in Juni and August. So hey need me at work in that months. Further the accomodation I  prefer at Camp California is the log cabin. Because, at first when I was a little child we were staying every holiday in a small house and I like that. At second, I don't like tents and I don't get used to it, so I prefer log cabins. About the different activities we like them all, but If I choose two I take sailing and tennis. In the summer I'm sailing  races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes. I'm not very good in Tennis but I can practise on my travel. Finally, I have one question about the money. Which things I must paid for on my travel? Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. How are you? With me is everything fine and the pop concert was great. I enjoyed helping at the popconcert, but it's very stressful work. You always walk from side to side to move things and there's no break. Some other work what I have done was to lead the people to there places. We have worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food. The most beautiful things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams. He's friendly and very handsome off course. If you see the famous singers in reality they are different and the most singers they haven't time for you. Another thing I have done was the make up  only for about fifteen minutes. That was very nice, because I didn't expected that. There were some people they gave me some advise  to clean the face and etc. Finally, it was a very nice day with great experience. Loves ",23.0
79,"  Dear Ms Clark, I had recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival. It was the first time I went and I was very pleased to go. I, actually, wasn't disappointed. However I would like to give my opinion about the festival. First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give. Therefore, you could invite artists from around the world  not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant. Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were  interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly meet some producers, who come from others countries in order to show different cultures. Besides, to pay one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time. Finally I suggest to invite important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it also  a kind of art! I look forward to seeing the next festival! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Laurel, Thank you for your recent letter. I couldn't write sooner because I was very busy last week. I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed  or not to do at home. To begin with the wchool rules we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late at your lesson, you have to apologize you to your teacher. Also when you have forgotten to do your homeworks. What's more, you had better have done them if you would have to go to the blackboard! Although our library is very large, we mustn't make  noise in order not to disturb the students, who work. It may be like that in your library, may not  it? I consider the school rules are good: we should respect the teachers and people who need to work. At home, I have to look after my two little brothers when my parent's are here. If I don't make the cooking, I will have to do the washing up. I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks. Fortunately I can play  violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework. It is what I like most. I don't really want to change that, I think it is just like this. I hope this answer satisfies you. I look forward to receiving your next letter! Best wishes ",31.00
1068," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm a student of your college and I write this letter for my class because I'm the class chief. On the hall of our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show  is it possible. We know that we will spend three days in London in a  with a determinate programme. First of all we make thanks for the good programme  especially for  the Science Museum on Tuesday 14th About the London Fashion and Leisure Show we are very excite to go because it's on extravagant and unusual show with leisure, sports wear and hairstyles. As I see  your programme the shopping  is at the same time of the London Fashion  so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to  Central Exhibition Hall without doing  shopping. It would be a great opportunity because for students it's free. If you don't have problems we attend yours, we hope good answer. Thank you  [SEP]  I think that my house isn't  of the future. It is comfortable, not too big with a lot of carpets and antiques components for example potterys, my bed, and a wardrobe of my grandmother. Think people's homes will be different in the future about the new materials of structures, they will have a lot of computers for doing recipes and making  shopping while you are staying at home. We will have a relaxing room, with soft light, music New Age and a lot of essences. I think that we can't stop the progress but if we want we can conserve  traditional things. The home of the future will be very impersonally and the atmosfear will be cold and very essencial. ",24.00
385," Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"", which as organised in your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was other actor instead of him, which came to me as a great disappointment. Secondly, as for the times , instead of 19.30 it all started at 20:15, which involved being stranded in the theatre for such a long time. Added to this, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. Nevertheless, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you  a full refund or at least part of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down. It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away. To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed. The worst point was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood. Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I determined to fall out with her. Since then, I hasen't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her since we had quarrelled was: ""It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!""

I am delighted that finally, I have won the first prise in your Competition. I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July that means I will not be able to come there  later. Moreover, I would rather stay in a tent than in a log cabin because I always stay in a tent when I am on holidays. It is not comfortable but it still like it. Concerning to the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good in it because I have attended a relevant course for three months. According to my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I have to bring with me? (like.. specific equipment or anything else). How much money do I need? I am looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people not. If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue. You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it  very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to. In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy. Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood. You should avoid the peak times. ",26.0
634," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize. It is the first time I won a prize! As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area. It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team, since I used to play it in my school's team and I think I'm pretty good at it. Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport. I'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money. I have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Carlitos Andrade  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay. However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family. Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. Its normal to have spending sprees. Everyone  had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid. Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date. In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time. On the other hand, if you think that you'll be on the red, I'd better stay at home. ",33.0

Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you know. We have  free timer on Wednesday  15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do  shopping quickly after sightseeing of London. I would be very pleased if you let us to go to the show. I also would like to say thank you for organising the good program for us. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A DAY OF MY LIFE It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again. I was afraid of doing it but I had to do it. It was the first time I had robbed a bank. I was her best friend. I promised her  to find a money for her operation. She was at the hospital and she was really bad. That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived  the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked  cashier to give me all  money. Before I took  money one of the cashier had pressed a button to call a police. I quickly left  bank. However, it didn't take long that they caught me soon. The policeman arrested me and I stayed in a prison for 15 years. The worst thing was my friend died after 10 days I was arrested. ",25.00

For exsample resently i was shopping at the market, which located in the center of our town. end what do you think? When i was there i saw  very beatiful T-shirt. i asked my mother to buy it. But my mother said: ""i haven't enough money to buy it"". i was abset of it. Our goverment  very burocrative. Our ministers  very criminal they are often breake the law, stole money. for example Paul Kozin had stole 800000000 dollars. Because of it our stare can't pay money to workers of schools, hospetols, builders. in our country  high nomber  unemploeers. Usual people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for money to enougher people. my parents can't buy me all what i want our society our full. each man think only about himself. quality of life  very low. But i hope that i will be  time when each person can buy to himself everything that he or she want. and shoppings will be allways enjoyable.  ",17.0
88," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show. We had a very disappointing evening yesterday. We thought that we would like to let you know all  details  which it didn't make us happy. First of all, we went to the theather to pick up our tickets. We were thinking  to get some discount on our tickets, because we had already read  from the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay  complete money for the show. We were ready for the show at 19.30. We sat  out sits and waited for the show but it didn't come out on time, it started at 20.15 which was  redicoulus time. We waited for 45 minutes. Secondly, when the show started, I was looking for Danny Brook, because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here. I realised that it was  different actor playing instead of Danny brook. I was very disappointed. After  show we went immediately to the tickets office for asking   money back, but they were to strict and close-minded. They just said, ""we don't give money back."" However we wanted to eat something at the Theatre Restaurant, but it was again  same with the others, because the restaurant was closed. Finally, we had a totally unhappy night with your show. You can't take this bad feeling back but you might give us our money back. This would be the first good memory for us  from your show. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe  [SEP]  People, who lives in the city, use lots of technological stuff. They make their life style much easy  more fast because they need to catch up with the other people. In the twenty first century things are changing very fast. If we look at a family life. They have typical this time life style. Children have  own televisions, computers and telephones in their room. Mother and Father have  own cars and mobile phones. Sometimes even the children have  own mobile phone as well. Full of technological tools and instruments in the house. Fire alarm, burglar alarm, house temperature checker, automatic garage door many of them. They use all of this because they want to do their work, and leisure activities with this helping kits. In the other hand, thy use all this too much. For example a mobile phone; People talk with it on the street, in the car almost everywhere. Some of them necessiraly some of them not. Just wersting time on it. They don't even think how they take the communication lines are busy, how many people  on the phone at  same time. Too many Anyway technology is the most important thing for our life. It developes day by day. The problem is ""Do we really use it properly or not?"" ",26.0
765," Dear Helen Ryan I am writting about this letter that I recently received from you, which is about a competition that I have won the first prize. I would like to know if  is possible for me going on July, because I have school on the others months, and it is impossible for me going on December or January. About the accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins instand of  tents, because  is safer and more confortable. The two activities that I prefer will be Basketball, because I had the experience to play in my school's big for almoust a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I practice since I was ten. On top of everything, I would like to ask how much money should I take, and which type of clothes are the best to wear in the competition. Yours sincerely Elisa F.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable If you are used to go to the Shopping very often, maybe  is because you don't know about all the others good things you can do on your weekend. People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare, it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some movie after that, and if you want buy something at the shops. On the other hand, everything at the shopping is more expensive, because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place. Instand of going to the theather, which is more cultural, or even do a picnic on the Ikurapiura park, people prefer spends all their money at Shoppings. So, why don't we try to change our customs and start to do knew things to enjoy ourselves. ",27.0
817," Dear Sir or Madam, I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all  paid  in advance. I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday. I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to the problems beyond my control. Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad. I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them. It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them. I came second  last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled  photography classes. In the camp I can practise them alot. I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency. Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another. But I finally got around  writing and you'll see that it's definetly worth waiting  as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you. As you know I'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A-level history, such as meeting up  my friends, visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own. However this term has been a far cry from the others. You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter. Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer  was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite. Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope. It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments. Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my  life write  me soon. Yours sincerely, ",35.0
