761," Dear Helen, I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to reply and ask you some questions. Firstly, I would be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, for the accomodation, I would say I prefer living in  tent rather than in  log cabin because I used to sleep in  tent while I was joining  a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have choosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would  ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial clothes for camping or the camp will provide them for me. I look forward to receiving the details of  travelling soon and  joining your camp in July. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but  also decrease the  money in my pocket. Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping  balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex. ",39.0
107," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to you to complaint about the problem that happened in the play called ""Over the rainbow"", and for this reason I would like to get some money back. The problem is that most part of the advertistment had mistakes. First of all, there were not discount on  tickets' price, and it was advertised. Secondly, the play was advertised  at 19.30, but it started at 20:15. Despite of this fact, that I did not care about it at the beginning, when the play started I did not see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor, I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook. Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it. But the main reason of my complaint, is that in the advertistment  said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not. Therefore for all things I would be happy to get some money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life The technology has affected so much my daily life. If I had not it, I could not do most part of the things that I do today. First of all, if I had not it, I would not be able to move out of my city because I would not have  car. But we have it, and the thing that have changed more my life has been the internet. Nowadays with my computer, I can travel everywhere in the world, just with it connected with a modem. internet have changed my life because with it, we can do everything at home. For example if someday I forgot the book, with the internet I can find the book inside it, and more information . Another thing apart from the internet and the car that has changed my life is the TV. With the TV I can know all the information at the moment, moreover I can see films throw it. And the best thing is that it entertaints me alone or with people. In conclusion I think that without the technology we could not live as good as we live know, and our lives would be so much boring. ",21.0
446," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should be one of the stars, instead there was one for me totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start. Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there was no discounts what so ever and finally, because of a shortage of staf, your restaurant was not available for us. This event was not what I call: ""a perfect evening out"", as your advertisement promised. I feel entitled to compensation for this event. I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities. Yours faithfully Carolina Patharius  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so stupied, telling her my secret after all I  been going through to keep it to myself. But now when the story was out, it was just to start to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around and worring about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face. I decieded to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lession. That evening I went to her house. I pretended to be totaly miserable. Pat didn't know what to do, she apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated. Finally I smiled. After huging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets. Especially not if it has to do with failing all  exams.... ",31.0
567," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am replying to your letter for the first prize of the competition, that I won and there are a number of thinks I would like to make clear. You asked me in your last letter when I would like to travel. I think the best time is the first two weeks of July, because I will be free then. I cannot travel earlier because I take an examination and I have to study for it. In addition, I would prefer to have a log cabin, because I am not used to sleeping in a tent, so it would be very difficult for me. at the beginning You state in your last letter that I will have the chance to do two activities. I would prefer basketball and swimming. When I was younger I attend I local basketball team and we became local champions, so I am good at basketball and have a lot of experience. I am also good at swimming. Last year I entered a swimming championship and won the silver medal. Finally, there is one think I would like to ask. Could you tell me what sort of clothes and how much money I should have with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you again. As you know, I helped  at a pop concert last month. and I must say it was fantastic. Let's start from the beginning. First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars. I had to iron them,  put them in order, so that the pop stars, who will sing at the concert,  look impressive. and handsome. The most exciting things happened later. I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful. I had a lot of things to do during the concert. I had to look after the tone that nothing goes wrong. That was very responsible but fortunately I had help from other person. I must say that being in a concert is very nice. But helping in a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all your need is co-operation and  don't think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Pantelis ",33.0
251," Dear Sir, My name is Furilo J.M. and last month I spent a few days in London, I visited you theatre. The reason I'm writting this letter for you is that in my staying in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre. When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone  actually didn't appear, I noticed there in the show,  someone completely different of him so I felt bad. Moreover, this complaining is not only about the actor, who ever , the problem is that the show started too late. I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began only  20:15.  I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't have any discounts as it was written on the folder. After the show I wanted some thing on the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed. After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad. I think I can forgive your theatre, only if you give me a refund of the money I spent there, and some other more for all the problems I had. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind. Every person in the world looks for technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life. We young people don't remember when technology wasn't part of our daily life, but our parents, or grand parents remember  exactly  when they were young, and everything was made in a different way, for example our parents didn't have computers at home when they were teenagers. Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer at your house, and when you have to do a homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to the school, also you can search for new subjects on the internet. Finally, technology is a word that  will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how technology, and in which speed it will develop to the future. Maybe, technology will never stop growing and our life will never work without computers. ",24.0
778," Dear Helen Ryan. I can only travel on July because these is the mounth when I have holidays. I've already talked to my manager, and she said that that's the only mounth I can have my holidays. I would prefer to stay in  log cabin because it must be cold to stay in a tent. I have some problems with my kidneys, so I can't stay in on of the tents, and it also must be very comfortable to stay  a log cabin. I'm really good at Golf and Tennis, so I would like to choose these two activities. I've been doing these activities for a very long time. I've been playing Golf for five years, and I'm a handidate cup of sixteen, but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day. I've been playing tannis since I was seven, and I've been studying how to play tannis for a very long time, nine years. I would like to know what kind of cloths do I need to take with me, and can you write  me back  what kind of weather it's going to be there, for the time I will be staying there. Also I would like to know how much money should I take with me, because I'm not sure how much I'll need to spend there. See you Mrs Helen Ryan, and please write me back, Ivan. S.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I wish you were there with me helping at a pop concert. I just loved it, I was working with these music system. You know how good I'm at music, anyway I was helping to these pop concert to get the corect sounds, at the bigging I was conecting all these wires into spekers, music system, guitar etc... The particularly bit that I liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar, you know how much I love playing guitar, and all these video cameras were just filming us. I asked on of the camera man when they're going to show these show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on  10 of June, so turn on your tv on these date chanel three, and  must seem me there playing with these guitar AH it was lovely. These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see these pop concert, beleave me you'll love it and you might use the drums, I told them that you're really good at drums so they want to try you too. I'll write  you soon Kim. Tell hello to your parents! ",26.0
498," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to you to complain about your Circle theatre. First of all I must say that ""over the rainbow"" is not the London newest and best musical show, for many reasons: In your advertisement I read the times , it was 14.30 and 10.30, however it started  20.15! So I've been doing the nothing for a long time and I don't like to lose my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove?, where were they the last weekend? the last weekend in the theatre  was a different actor who was disappointing. To make the evening worse the tickets were not discounts available, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over. I want the money back, if you don't give it to me back, I will intend to write to the press and explain everything, and of course I won't be the only one. I am so furious because when I asked for  money back that day, the sir wasn't able to give it back because he would be sack. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  the secret lover Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually makes up some extra information. On day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes (as Pat likes women). The only problem was that the girl was to shy to speak to him, she wanted to keep her name in secret, and if Pat tells someone something about the letter, she won't say who  is. Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time, even eating his nails. As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it. Three days after we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, ""oh Pat don't tell  that lie again"", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter. We laughed and explained  him that we were   who wrote that letters, and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover, a real one,  don't tell anyone because  he won't meet her. ",22.0
1148," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. As you asked me in the letter, I am very happy to help you with finding out  details of the conference. The hotel that your group will be staying at is  Palace Hotel. It is reasonably near to the college, so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along  River Thames following  yellow signs on sunny days. If it rains, you can take  bus 54 that stops in front of the college. The end-of-conference party is designed to give  rough ideas about many different cultures. So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world. As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country. Other members of  groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress. On the last day, I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city. It is about 1000 years old, so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you imagine your life without any computers at all? Well, I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert! If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear  that  invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives. For example, all infrastructures such as  transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals. In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers. So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important. From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool. It improves  productivity of my homework, that is often essay writing, and also it allows me to access to the internet. Since I live abroad, the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and  to know what is going on in my home country. To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both indivisuals and a society as a whole. ",38.00
487," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complaint about the show 'Over the Rainbow'. During my stay in London I went to your theatre to see this show. As it is said in your advertisement, the show is starring Danny Brook but there was  different actor . It is not the only problem. The show had to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. You promised that there will be discounts, but when I came, I found out, that they were not available. I wanted to go to your restaurant. I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we will go there. And what I found out. Your restaurant was closed. You promised that if we go to your show we will have a perfect evening. Everything was just vice versa. I am very disappointed, that is why I am asking you for compensation. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. It happened at the end of  school year. My class was going to a night disco and I wanted to go there too. I asked my parents if I could go, but they did not let me do that. I tried to persuade them, told that nothing will happen to me, promised to do all  housework. But all they have done is told me that I am to young for it and I can go there only when I am 20 years old. I had such a desire to go to the disco, that I decided to go even without  parent's permission. I told my secret to my best friend Pat. But she told it to very kid in school, even the teachers heard it. It occured that one of the teachers told my parents about it. At the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks. I understood that I must keep my secrets and do not tell anybody, even the best friend. ",28.0
573," Dear Ryan, I have received your letter and I  so happy because I have won the holiday in California. It will be a pleasure for me give you the information that you need. First of all I would like to travel in July because I am going to Ibiza with my parents in June and in August I start to work part-time, so I am afraid but I can go only in July. With reference to the accommodation I would prefer  log cabins to  tents. I think the log cabins are more comfortable and I have never slept in a tents. I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least at the weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos to animals. I would like to know, how much  I need and what type of clothes I should take? Could you tell me about the weather, please? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are very well. I am writing about my exciting experience at a pop concert. First of all I was too busy but it does not matter because I enjoyed a lot of this experience. I was doing different activities from designering flier to selling tickets. I had to search in the internet  pictures that could be used for the flier. We booked the accommodation for the group. I was responsible for checking the light and sound. In addition I checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone. As you know I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too. Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experience in my life, but the concert day was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event. If you have the opportunity of involving in something like this you do not hesitate. Yours sincerely ",32.0
1181," Dear Mrs Smith: I have received your letter which informs me you are now in charge of the group of students attending the international conference. It is my pleasure to help you with the information you need. Your group has been booked into The Palace Hotel, located on the High street, opposite to the Post Office. The conference will be hold in The Royal Hall, and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus. Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall. The end-of-conference party will be hold in Francescos Restaurant, just by The Royal Hall. You should wear casual clothes. About what you can do in the area for the free time you have, I would suggest you to visit The Modern Art Museum which has now a new exhibition. Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through the Spring Gardens which are beautiful in this time of the year. I hope all this information is helpful for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Telephone: A great invention. Imagine your life without a telephone. Yes, I know, it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention. Think about the people living in the time it was invented. Must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for........ and now for us  is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to. Of course  is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family, but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies. For example, I work for a bank, and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far, and he doesn't have to come here, we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks, and that is it! What about emergencies? A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the life of many people having a heart attack. We sometimes don't realize the importance of some inventions we use in our everyday life. But think...., what would we do without them! ",35.00
159," Dear Sir/Madam, Having seen your musical show last Sunday, I am writing to complain  the problems and to ask for some money back. Firstly, concerning  actors, in your advertisement you stated that DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE would perform in the musical, but in fact different actors performed. I was so disappointed!! Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant, to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minuits because it started at 20:15. As well as this, after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant, which you referred  in your advertisement, but it was closed already. I was really angry! Lastly, with reference to ticket prices, your theatre hadn't any discounts even for children. I had to buy an adult ticket for my child and spent more money than I had expected. I am sure you can imagine what I felt. It was not  perfect evening for me and my child at all! I am also sure you can refund my money. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Kwa Phat Sun.  [SEP]  Dear Tae, How are you getting on? I'm fine. Having talked with you a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to give you some information. I know you are always interested in detictive stories especially Agatha Christie's. Don't be surprised! Her best detective stories are going to be read on the radio this Sunday evening at 18:00. I'm sure you'll be pleased. You are supposed to listen to them. As well as this, the stories are going to be read in English. It's  good chance for you to improve your English. You can not only listen to her best detective stories, but also learn English automatically. It will be fantastic! Where the stories are concerned, they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and  naraitors are going to read clearly. What I'd like to say is you should listen to them. I hope you're happy to receive my letter and am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Kwa Phat Sun ",31.0

When the show started the starring was wrong because it said that act Danny Brook and Tina Truelove  and Danny Brook did'n act, it was another actor that nobody knew, ""Really this is very disappointing"". After the show I planned to go to the restaurant with my wife, but what do you think it happened? ""The restaurant was closed"". Manager I spect that you considered my bad experience in your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because, it was a very bad evening.

All started when Pat, the best friend of Nick, wanted to make the party in his house, most of the class disagree with that because the house of Pat is extremly little, they started to say  him that his house was like a box. Pat got very angree and sad. Pat affected with this situation told Nick all  the situation and the secret of the class. At the beginning Nick got angree but then he forgive him because they were friend and each of one can trust on the other.

I have decided I would like to visit Camp California only in July because I have already organized an other trip for the month of august. I would rather prefer sleeping in  log cabins if its possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground. I have also chosen as activities the ones of Golf and tennis. I am rather good at these sports because I have practised them since I was a little girl. I am better at tennis that at golf but anyway I have experience in both these sports. I have also several simple questions. I would like to know how much money I have to take and what type of clothes I need. Do I have to take with me my tennis raquet and my golf bag? I would be very thankful to recieve answers to my questions. thank you. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: How are you? I'm fine. I finish school next week. I have to tell you all about the pop concert I helped to organize last month. it was really cool. I got the chance to meet Ricky Martin. Boy, He's really really handsom! I was in charge of the lights of the stage, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage. It was hard work because I have been practising for several weeks. I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lightened with a blue light or a green one. Even though I ended  terribly tired I really enjoyed myself. It was a strange experience because its something new for me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!! Well, its an experience I'll never forget as long as I live.

352," To the manager of the Circle Theatre - London Dear sir, I write to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I saw last night. Firstly I was very disappointed in finding out that not-ever-heard actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected. Besides this, no discounts for students were available. I'm very sorry to let you know that not only was the show really boring, but it started also 45  late - This shouldn't happen! In addition to this, I heard bad singers and noticed a numertable lack of variety in  ballets. Furthermore I couldn't drink a cup of coffee after the show in the theatre restaurant. I've been told it was closed because of a waiters' strike. I know this is not up to you, but it was very annoying. This show might be the newest in London, but   not the best at all. I do eventually think it would be fair to give the spectators their money back - So  ask you  a complete refund (cash) of the ticket price. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We all know that she isn't good in keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time. Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days. Their parents were so happy that  decided to give him a fantastic present: the brand new car he had always dreamed of. This should be a big surprise for him: the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush-hush atmosphere. Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car, but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend ""It will be delievered on Thursday! Can you imagine Philip's face when he'll see his favourite car out there?"" He couldn't believe his ears! The great day came. The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual  activity all over the house. Everyone seemed to be looking for something. ""Are you looking for these?"" asked Philip showing the keys of the car. And  disappeared heading for the rear door. ",36.0
865," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply for your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer season, and it is nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer my accomodation to be in  log cabins, because I am alergic to some insects that might go in the tent. In regard to the activities, I would like tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have  some techniques, that I would like to put on practise. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where can I change my money to American dollars cheaper. I would  ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are doing fine, I am writing this letter, to tell you about my experience of helping  a pop concert. Firstly, you need to know, and be counscious of what you are doing. I spend two weeks preparing all the stage, speakers, background, michrophones, everything with all the staff, and every night, the artists came to rehearsal their show, I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff. The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired, however, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts were worthy, the crow and artists thanked the staff. What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all like a big team, working together. That was what made it mostly special. Try it, I recommend it. Write back soon, Love, Carmen Dolores Rossell. ",36.0
750," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month. First of all, I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school's activities so my parents just let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes. About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been practicing it during 5 years so I want to keep on it. The other activity that I chose is painting, I am not as well as I want, nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course. I would rather   tends than  log cabins for  accommodation because the last summer I had the great opportunity to be in a log cabin and now I want to know  the other one . I am sure it will be thrilling to stay near the nature and at the same time, it would be a new experience for me. I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me  appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know, is the amount of money that I have to bring with me. If you need more information, please do not hesitate on writing  me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: John Weller. From: Raquel Rossell. Re: Suggestions for the film. Introduction To make easier and faster this report , it was necessary to make a questionarie which was gave out in the school. After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results: 1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the listening room room and the library because as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places  helping them to improve their English on their own. 2 - They also think, that  filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes. 3 - The least but not the last, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activities organised by the social programme, has became really exciting, so they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those that did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying  and they mentioned it as not really important. Conclusion As you can see, my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have. Despite of being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar. I do recommend to pay attention to the food in the cafeteria because even though it was not the main reason of this report, they also wrote complaning about that. If you need more information and the sheets that I collected, please do not hesitate on asking me for them. ",29.0

1093," Dear, Mr Robertson. I am writing to ask  some information about the programme which our class would like to join. There are a few questions which I have wondered. First of all, Would you give me an explaination about the London fashion and Leisure show? We regard that the show might be  great opportunity for the most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure. In addition, I would like to get your suggestion  how  programme could be changed on the second-day of the trip. so that we could enjoy going to both  science Museum and the London fashion and leisure show. I am appreciated  you for offering a well-organised programme, especially, the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in. I am looking forward to getting your reply. your sincerely.  [SEP]  In the middle age, Nobody expected to have a electric goods which have been helping to do housework. It made woman to be free from drudgery, so that they could utilize time for improving themselves. As the result, we can observe that the home of the present have a lot of machines which make home like a factory. By contrast, In the future, I guess we would rather go back to the acient time, owing to have natural life style. We will be unwilling to give a housework away. Being at home with doing housework, taking care of their children, might be  purpose of the future life. ",18.00
1231," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter. I am sorry about Richard Brown. And I understand that you need help, so that I will help you as far as I can. Firstly, the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference. In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will offer. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference. The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well. Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience in here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals. As you may hear, our city is well known for the musicals. Or, If you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel. Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice. If you have more questions about the conference and something else, do not hesitate to ask me. I would be glad to be able to help you. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined. People do not have the impression on important inventions any more, because they have been getting more popular and common. However, there is something  which  is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention. This is electricity invented by Edison. From my point of view, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines, appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity, which makes people not to too much phisical labour. What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity. In my life, I use electricity in many different ways. At night, I can study because of it. and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry, cleaning rooms and ironing. It makes my life more convenient than that without it. To sum up, although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more, the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed. ",37.00
424," Dear Sir or Madam. I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see ""Over the Rainbow"", the musical show that was played at this moment. First of all, the actors mentionned in the advertisement were not those who played  the show. Not that I was very disappointed not to see the good actors! The, if the show had started on time, it could have been much better, but it started forty five minutes late, it is too much for me! Plus, it is mentionned, on your advertisement, that discounts were available, in fact, no discount were done to me, whereas I am a student and as a student I was allowed to have a discount but I paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discount for this show. Finally, I think that this evening was very far  to be perfect, and I ask you for my money,  I spent for this horrible evening in your theatre, back. I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back. Your Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technologies are part of our daily life, everything we do is simplified by these new technologies. It is faster with new technologies to go from one place to another, for example, we can us a car or public transports such as  trains or buses instead of walking or riding as  in the past. Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too, washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done, some specific machines are made to do this stuff, it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport, relaxing... New technologies allow us to work more efficiently, with computers, complex operations can be achieved in a close time and with the insurance that the result is correct.  Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves on what happens in live, or search for  special leisure with a quick result. Finally, new technologies help us to save our free time and to work more quickly and more efficiently. ",21.0
364," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you, because I would like to disagree with your advertisment for the show 'over the Rainbow'. I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I  your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was  totally different actor. As it is said in  advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because by the programme it started at 20.15, but that was not the end of the story, in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets, that was not true! I was not still very disappointed, because I hoped that I will have a good meal with  glass of wine in the restaurant,  according to your advertisment but what did I  realised, it was closed, because the chef was in the hospital. I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money back. Yours faithfully, Sasha Comatova.  [SEP]  Everyday we keep in touch with technology. We have microwaves that help us to do our meal quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that made our life easier. I use different technological things everyday. Such as  mobile phone that helps me to communicate, with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home, I use  stereo, if I want to listen to my favourite music, I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, ect. I think that all these things made my life much easier. Many years ago people didn't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot. I am very happy that with all  technology that we have we don't have to work as much as they did,  like to wash plates and cups after meals, my dishwashing machine will do that for me, and I don't have to wash my clothes my washing machine does it better. Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over  humans and of course it makes me lazy. However now I have more freedom, free time, and privacy. ",28.0
60," Dear Jane C I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival recently and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it. When I knew it was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small  that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all  events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money. Although that Festival was not well-organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls. I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It is really nice to hearing from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other. Personally, I can not imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others. As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important  concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority . As a consequence, most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them. At home it is the other way about. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting friends , watching TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate with  house-keeping and meal. That is all! Hope you enjoy my experiences Best wishes ",31.00
1029," 1st. March, 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you for organising the programme about the trip to London. There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and especially they are looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting  National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London. The students in my class have just seen the advertisement for a show in today's edition of The Times. There will be The London Fashion and Leisure Show in Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March. It starts  10:00 am and finishes  9:00 p.m. All of my classmates would like to go there because it is a great chance to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Besides, students don't have to pay  entrance fee because it is free for students. The fashion show is only on the 14th of March, so I would be grateful if you could allow all of my classmates to go there after visiting  Science Museum instead of going shopping. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life. However, in my opinion, famous people, such as politicians and film actors, deserve to have a private life. First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time. Another reason that I agree  famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was  ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death. To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media. ",30.00
624," Hello! My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition. Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office for experience. I hope, that's possible. I would prefer living in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is more natural. A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday. It sounds like a summer-holiday at the beach of Italy. From the activities  I want to take Golf and Surfing. Both activities I've never done in my life, so I am a complete beginner in playing Golf and in Surfing. But the reason I want to try these two activities are their image. Golf play the wealthy people, the upper class of a town, and surfing sounds like freedom. There is only one more question I want to ask: Can I take my girl-friend with me, of course with paying? I hope all my wishes are realizeable. Yours  [SEP]  In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only  a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing! ",31.0

First of all the starring that was supposed to be  (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there, I was so enthusiastic about your starring, when I realized was a failure, even though they do good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there, at 19:15, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15, it cannot be possible that a schedule for a show  have had a big change. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait forever until  you want. Also  was said that Discounts will be available, but I didn't received any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people, do it. On the other hand, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization. That was so uncomfortable, people was starving. I am so disappointed with this, that I am in all my right to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't   expected. Please let me know . sincerely yours  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I am 17 years old, and my life has been very normal. Since I've got a computer with  Internet, my social life has changed. Now I have more friends and I have more fun. This has helped me a lot, because I can talk with my friends that are living in other countries. Technology has a lot of programs that lead you communicate with others in a more easy way. 'Speak Freely' is fantastic, you don't pay and you can hear the voice of the one you miss. This has opened another world to me, distances aren't so sad, they are more close. I have learned a lot with  Internet, it gaves me the posibility to know more about things I've never knew . It is incredible how it opens  to you another reality, a different view of life. Now I have a different style of life, I am more open to  world's problems and progress. I am interesting in reading articles and developing myself. Technology had gave me another life,  has helped me. My knowledge has been developed and also my life style. I think that modern technology is our future, we don't have to depend on it, but we have to work for a biggest improvement. ",25.0

Secondly, the time  in your advertisement told that it should start  19:30, but it did not start before 20.15 And then about the tickets, you wrotte that they were discounts available but they were not. Finaly when we had seen the Musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they done some dekoreting, and you wrott in your advertisement ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"" We are very disappointed, it was not a perfect evening out for us, therefore we would  have your money back.

If you travlling around you can see  lot of different still from different culture. At first I think that in the future we are going to wear less clothes because the climet are being warmer and warmer. Secondly I think we have more mixing clothes from all over the world, because we are traveling more and more around. And that is nice if you can pick up the best thing from all over the world, but on the other hand it is not so nice if every country wear  some type of clothes. Finaly about my oppinion I wish we are going to dress us more as  in the past with nature matrial, we most think more about the eviorment and leave closer to the earth. ",20.0
1149," Chêne-Bourg, Tuesday 12th June. Dear Mrs Smith, it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown's illness, and  hope to see him soon in an excellent health. Nevertheless, I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting. We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel. Furthermore, since it is located between the airport and our location, a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room. The end-of-conference party is to be held at the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness. Therefore, all  guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted. As for the three hours of free time, I strongly suggest you to check-in your lugages at the airport and then, after a five-minutes bus ride, spend your time in the marvellous 'Old City'. Best Regards,  [SEP]  My fair Mobile Phone. The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last  years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is, of course, the mobile phone. It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities. Trades, politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs. However, the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student. It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as e uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations... Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday's courses. Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone, but his parents'! ",26.00

Then I want to receive my money for the ticket. After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote 'discouts available' but they didn't  discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired. You advertised for my perfect evening out. But I was unpleasent because of these things. So I ask you to return some money back.

I would like to answer how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife. I have much housework to be done from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric products; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juice, fridge. I think I can have my spare time owing to these thing. For example if I don't have  washing machine, I will have to wash all  clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. During the washing machine is whirring, I can get my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without  car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them. Owing to all of them, I can live very comfortbly. These things provide me  all convenience. ",26.0

I am afraid but I think that the show was not as good as I expected: the reason were many. - Danny brook did not play and I wanted to see him. - the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30. Please check your times because many people had to leave at the middle of the show. - When the musical finished I was terrible hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open.

In on hand we have the advantages the new technology permits you  many things like fly, see in the dark, or  even save your life when you are almost dead. But in the other hand we have the disadvantages. The technology makes your life easier but, until when? For example, the car was developed by the modern technology, it makes your life easier but also  ""dangerous"". Why? Because too many cars mean too much CO2 in the air. And all people know that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kind of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give  and permit you  may things wich would be impossible in other times but also gives you many problems. ",29.0

We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions, make up,  hairstyles instead of going to do shopping.

It would be much  technological or far less complex. it could be as simple as we think. but the imagine of the life style depends on  person. On the other hand, it would not be changed. Somehow I could say that the main appliance would remain the same working structure. it only just might be changed the design of things such as a triangular talking oven. Despite being used in many ways, it could entartian us as well. On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier. to live.

330,"  Dear manager, I am writing to tell you that I stayed very disappointed with the theatre. One of my reasons  to travel to London, was this theatre. I knew that ""Over the rainbow"" was horrible! I thought that it was the best musical show that London had. I was wrong, very wrong. In the propaganda  had written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are supposed to be the actors, and in the theatre  had totally differents actors. I bought my tickets fuee days before the theatre thinking I will have  discounts. But it happenned the opposite. I payed the same as  who bought the tickets ten minutes before the theatre. Other thing I have to complement is about the time of the theatre. It was supposed to starts at half past seven, and it started only at fifteen  past eight. After all this, I want to know if I will have some money back. I hope so. yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It is true that science and technology affects our lives a lot. The technology is essencial to our life, we need it on each minute, on each second. It is rare the schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use. But it is good and bad in the same time. Good because you can have acess to a lot of informations, and it is bad because the computers are getting the people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who have the certain  that the computers will not get the place of the teachers? It is interesting to starts to think about this point. Another point is that the television is taking the childhood of the children. For example, our parents had time to played with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only shows silly programmes. We need this technology, but we have to know how to control this. ",24.0

I m always been intents when I went with the university camps so I  prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in there.

I look forward to going with your camp in the near future. Yours sincerely (THONGCHAI ENPHENO)  [SEP]  Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable because of different reasons and places. In the first place, some housewifes don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you   forget to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore! Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want. Sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no  your size left. I cannot imagine anything worse. The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay  everything  buy  credit card. When a bill comes to £1000, you would be shocked and regret what you had done. In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully. ",31.0
327," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow. My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook. We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor. The show should have started at half past seven but we had to wait for forty-five minutes without any kind of explanation. Not only was the show late and awful but it was expensive too. The advertisement said there were discounts available but when we arrived there the woman who sells the tickets told us the discounts were only available on Monday evenings. Despite the terrible evening we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to relax and have dinner, but we found it was closed because its floor was being repaired. As you can see it wasn't a perfect evening at all! That is why I am writing to you. I want you to give  our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true. There should be no problem as I still have the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you.

I'm writing to you now because I've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christie. It will be the following Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening. It's a story titled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it. The story is about the life in a small village. The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman. That woman is supposed to have killed her husbands (at least two), because she wanted their money. The policeman lets her know he has discovered her and he won't allow another crime. He threatens to tell her husband what she had done. However, she's a very clever woman and she doesn't look worried. In the end, the three of them are having a cup of coffee and one of the cups contains a terrible poison. There will be a horrible accident in a few seconds. Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends. Drop me a line and let me know what do you make of the story. Best wishes, ",35.0
911," Dear Ms Ryan Helen, thank you for the information, I am glad I've won first prize! I would like to go in July for it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accomodation I  prefer to live in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to attend to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to join the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities on two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing. I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to be aware of what clothes I should take. Another thing I am interested in is general information of prices in the USA. I would greatly appreciate your soonest answer. Yours sincerely E. Sidorov.  [SEP]  I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good,  probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrances of it! ",38.0
389," Dear Sir, I write this letter because I find there were too many problems concerning your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". At first, I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor, but she must have been changed since the actor was different. I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre. Nevertheless, I stayed since I had paid. I also want to put the stress on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm. It is a really a shame! In fact, if I had knowned, I would have probably stayed at home. We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available. Nonetheless, there were no discounts available at all. And, we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant in so far as it was closed. Indeed, there was a little paper on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness. Consequently I ask you for some money back seeing that I think: it's not worth the bother to loose money for such a show., Thank you.  [SEP]  I think that modern technology change my daily life. Indeed, daily life is easier thanks to technology. For example, if I want to buy something, I have to go on my computer and buy it. But it will make me lazy. On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we've got more and more possibilities to enjoy ourselves since she invents a lot of products. But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes cheap and I can't afford it. In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it hadn't existed since there are too many things on  market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different marks. And it's all the more tyring since you often wait during two weeks before buying it. I'm bound to feel nervous. To put it in a nutshell, I would like to say that technology can be a good thing, but it creates many problems too. ",27.0
1176," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference on your letter concerning an organization of an international student conference in Wimbledon Art College. Below I am clarifying some information you asked about. First of all, I would like to give you more information about  name and location of the hotel. The group has been booked into  ""Maria Luisa"" hotel which is situated on the center of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village. This hotel is the next building after  Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place. Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is planed to be in Wimbledon Common -  nice piece of England nature. So, it may be a good idea to take some very comfortable and informal clothes. Thirdly, talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area, I would suggest you to visit  Wimbledon Museum of Tennis. Where is quite  good exposition their, giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon Tennis Tournaments. I look forward to meeting your group in our conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Report. Introduction: The purpose of this report is to give a brief discription of the Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg. From my point of view this building is the best option to visit. Location: This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of  Niva River with an exellent view on the Hermitage Museum. History: The building was built by  very famious Russian architect and is a marvellouse example of Russian classic architerture of  XVIIIth century. Facilities: In the Academy of Art you can find the oldiest art libarary with a wide range of books,  the Museum of Russian Art with a huge collection of painting, sculpture and architectural projects from  early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries. It is also a good chance to be introduced with  Russian system of art education. Conclusion: The building of  Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting as  historical as educational aspects. ",27.00
1073," Dear Mr. Robertson I am a student from your class and I would like to thank you first of all. It's a good programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show. That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00. They show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear ands something for the women: make up and hairstyle trends. That show is free for students, so it's also a big advantage. We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing. I know that it is a change. But I have thought about it. On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich. Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime. I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge, as well. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Who would like to be famous? Are you dreaming of being a Star? It must be wonderful when you have a lot of money and everybody seems to know you. Really? I think the main problem is that you would lose your private life. That's the price you have to pay nowadays. But you need all the journalists to become famous so the only way is to accept that there are journalists and that they are just doing their job. No one told you to be famous. If you are famous it was your choice and therefore  is a price  to pay. Of course you have fame and poverty. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on the street. To sum up I think, if you  well-known you have to deal with that. There's no other way. Everone knows you because of the journalists so  can't just ignore them, can you? ",30.00
27," Dear Jane Clark, I had a wonderful time at the International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea  to enjoy arts from around the world, but I also have some complaints. First of all, I got disappointed when I found that there were no artists from Indonesia. There were stars and artists from only six countries. Secondly, the concert halls. The performances were great, but some halls were too small to accomodate so many people  there were that day. A crowded hall is not good  to enjoy musics. Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success. I liked  plays and films, and want to see more next year. The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy  arts without worrying about money. So all you need to improve  is to have larger concert halls. I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held using more notice boards. I have no doubt that you will succeed in next year's festival. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I would like to recommend the job, a home teacher. It is a job that you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house. The best advantage of this job is the payment. It is very good considering how less time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home teachers are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it means they take lessons after school, not in a daytime. So, in a daytime, we can focus in our studyings. It is not so easy for every student, though. Because teaching requires a lot of knowledge. You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, for it is your responsibility to provide your student  right information. As you see, teaching is a hard work in some respect. But I am enjoying it and getting a lot out of it. ",30.00
411," Saturday 17th June Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied about it. Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to be appeared. Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical show was annoying. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it. I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing. I would you informed us before. Secondly, furthermore I had to pay full price whereas you granted us some discount prices. I was very interested in visiting your theatre restaurant after the show but it seemed to me it was closed. Your assistant prevented us from visiting it because it was too late and he was so busy. Finally, you thought that you could grant us a perfect evening but it was not true. Consequently, I would like you refund my bill. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, we need modern technology to improve on daily life. In my opinion, science and technology will have consequences on my behaviours. First of all, as you also know, lots of technology have boosted since  few years. For example, without using  internet I could not put me through to foreign people. This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as a eagle. I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phone, lap top computer, television, to have contacts with different cultures. Secondly, technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before. Unfortunately, it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars, factories. I can't go to the towncentre of  big city. There are links between the greenhouse, technology and me. To conclude, we must not forget that science and technology is a tool   to live better. Be carefull, my own technology can kill me. I can use it but with some limits. ",22.0
41," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, I am writing with reference to the International Arts Festival  I have recently been to and I would like to give you my opinions about it. According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there were stars and artists from around the world; but they were only from six countries. In addition to this some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there fro the occasion and, personally speaking  the show could be done at the open air next year, so that  music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around. Plays and films had a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it. The other events I went to, dance shows, art exhibitions and talk by writers, were well organised and extremely interesting. Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was  excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part to the Festival. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear George, I'm writing to answer your question about  rules in my life, at school and at home. As you may know, I attend a Liceo, which is the most difficult kind of high school in Italy. Our teachers are very strick, we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down!,,. We can't talk during lessons and we only have a en minutes break at 10.30 a.m. If we're late, we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature  to go to class. It's hard to be extremely quite for five hours but I reckon it's a good way of education. On the other side, I feel free at home. I help doing  cleaning or the washing, but I do it because I want to, not because my parents make me do it. I can go out and stay out late, I've got my car and my mobile, so that they can call me whenever they need to hear me; but above all I know they trust me and consider my an adult. Therefor I wouldn't change anything in my home life and neither in my school life. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. ",33.00
104," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre   ""Over The Rainbow"". I went to see it on time as it was written  19:30 but it started t 20:15 with a delay of 45 minutes. This is nothing, it was said that Danny Brook was starring. However a different actor starred and we were all disappointed. What is more, about the tickets, discounts were not available as it was not said so. The last disappointing thing is that the theatre restaurant was closed so we could not visit it after the show. As well as you can understand I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing. Therefore, if avaliable, can you play my money back please? My address is here for any contacts, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  PAT LIKE A BLACK CAT Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He told everything that Pandora said, to everyone which Pandora didn't want them to know. Pandora had done something very bad like a robbery and one day told this to Pat because she was very shy and regretful. Pat was her best friend so she told to him. However, she didn't know that Pat couldn't keep secrets well. One day while all their friends were there and talking, Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery. All of them were schoked by what they heard. As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere. After a week of holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that every of her friends knew  that. She became very shy and engry She couldn't talk with people and she just was very sad. Finally, she couldn't wait and wear to talk to Pat. He admitted that it was his fault to say and told everyone that it was a joke to make Pandora a bit angry. After all  they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets. ",24.0
726," 13, June, 2000 To Helen Ryan, Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you for the letter. I got it today and couldn't believe it! As you asked me for some further information. I will write it down. I'd like to travel in July and this is the only time I can travel, because I am busy with a school project until the end of June and I am  to work in a hospital for the summer holidays in August and September. For accommodation, I prefer log cabins, because I believe I can meet more people if I stay in log cabins and it's a lot of fun to talk with them. I'd like to play tennis and basketball while I am there. I have never played basketball, but I have played tennis for 6 years and I am a good player. I have never traveled abroad and don't know if I should bring a credit card with me. If you have suggestions, can you write to me again? Thank you again and take care, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  13 June, 2000. Dear Kim, Hi! How are you doing? I'm fine. As you asked me about the concert, I'll write about it today. First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took  long  to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get to excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans. By the time it finished, I was exhausted, but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free! Have you had an interesting experience? Please write about it in the next letter. I hope to hear from you soon. Yours ",33.0
148,"  Mr. Jones, How are you? I'm not so well, and that's the reason why I'm writting this letter to you. Because you are the manager at the theatre, you have to know,  the problems which it has. First of all and the most important for me is that you lie to your audience. I didn't see anywhere Danny Brook, but another actor. That it was a big mistake. Unfortunatly your advertisment  said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later. Also there weren't any discounts. Oh! I as almost forget. You restaurant was closed because your cooker was ill. What can you say about that? So, that's why I'm asking you to give me, some of  money back. The perfect evening out I was waiting for, it was finally one of the most disappointed, of mine. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? That's a good question! I know that, each student gave its  different answers, but some of us will have some opinions. I think that, the big 'improve' of technology  the last 30 years helped and  still helping us a lot in our daily life. With T.V we can learn, what is going on all over the world. With the telephones, the aeroplanes,  even the fast ships there are no big distances any more. Eve summer I'm going with my family abroad. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer (  internet) I can speak with my friends, as far they are. All these may be sounds great, but they aren't all . With a lot of using of  T.V and computer, make people more close. You might not know your neighbour because all the time your  in the house. Children are not studying as much  they have to, because they are watching T.V, speacing on the phone or even playing computer games. That's why my marks this year were  bit low. And ofcourse my parents were very angry with me. This is also another reason of heard attacts. ",22.0
1236," Dear Mrs Smith: My name is Juniper, I am helping to organise the conference in the college. I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions. The group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held. You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference, it only takes ten minutes approximately. As for the end-of-conference party, it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9:00. All the students and staffs will join together in the hall. They can play games and talk about  personal experience. The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world. So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart. I have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you. If you are free I will show you arround our college. You can visit our newly-built science lab as well. I'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Best wishes.  [SEP]  Best choice Welcome to London. You asked me for an interesting building to visit. In my opinion, I'll recommend  British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there. The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge white round building which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library before! The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson! Apart from the national history, there are more content about the past of the world. You can go to many sections such as  Asia Hall, Egypt Hall, Europe Hall and so on. Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate. After a visit to  British Museum, you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away! Also you don't have to pay any money for it, and the transport is extremely convenient, therefore  British Museum is your best choice. Don't be hesitant any more! ",34.00
426," Dear Sirs, The Circle Theatre was so far the best theatre in my opinion, but now, I must change my opinion. I visited your Theatre yesterday. I would like to see the best musical show with the best artists. Unfortunately instead of Danny Brook we have seen  unknown actor. We have disappointed. Moreover this show did not start at 19.30, but 45 minutes later. Another problem - the tickets for students according to your advertisement should be available with discounts - unfortunately I could not buy such  ticket. During the interval I would  drink coffee in  theatre restaurant - it was closed. I don't know, why? I no thought, that so serious  theatre makes such mistakes. In accordance with, I would like to ask you to return me my money. I hope that your answer will be positive, and in the future in your theatre all will be O.K. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? ""Fashion of the Future"" - it is  good question. Fashion are changing every year. During the next fashion shows we observe new clothes. In my opinion in the future people will wear clothes made of a natural fabrics; silk, cotton, leather, wool. All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people. Women will prefere the long skirts and short blouses and jackets. Of course, it will be smart clothes. Young people will wear jeans and T-shirt. Such clothes is comfortable and easy in using. Teenagers have not free time to go to a washing-cleaner. Men will wear as usualy - a suit. Fashion colours - it will be earth colours: grey, blue, yellow, brown. For special ocassions, for example - the party, the concert, people will wear very smart. I think that it will be: dresses,  suits swewed by the well-known tailors.  All materials should be thin, delicate and soft, because of the warmly climate. I think that, we will observe a little and slow changes in fashion, but I hope that new clothes will be always pleasent for people. ",23.0
760," Dear Madam, First, I would like to thank you for offering me this wonderful prize. For a long time I wish I came to Camp California, and now my dream is about to become true. There is no much time left in my timetable in August since I will have to work then, so I would rather come in July. Concerning the accomodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather... Since this stay at Camp California is a good occasion to discover new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner in both activities. Then, I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need there, and if I have to bring a lot of money. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Richard Amelin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably now, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert. What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons. The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: ""You know. I already know them, I have even helped them at one of their concert."" Moreover, the work I've had to do, apart from carrying material, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them. Even though my entire body aches ( material was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it a work! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Richard Amelin ",31.0
701," June, 13th 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter which said that I won the first prize in the competition. As I didn't expect to be successful, I am very happy about this result. I would now like to answer the information you requested. Firstly, I would be pleased if I could travel in July as I already booked this month as a holiday at work. Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience  to sleep in the middle of the nature. I am especially glad about the activities offers, in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sport teacher. I have been playing Basketball for many years but I would appreciate to improve my skills, in particular the ball-handling. Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly await having the possibility to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect in  crawl. I know I have already asked a lot but there is one more thing I need to know which kind of clothes will be appropriate and how much money will I approximately need? I trust I mentioned all the requested details and am now looking forward to hearing from you to arrange the exact date of departure. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  June, 13th 2000 Dear Kim, how are you doing? Thanks for your latest letter - I was really happy about your news! Here, everything is as usual: School, studying, eating, sleeping - but did I tell you about my latest job? I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you can't imagine how exciting it was! First of all, I helped selling tickets and drinks and there I realized how bad my maths is - I took such a long time to give back the change! But at the end I handled it almost automatically. Before the performance I introduced the spectators to their seats and then a instructor showed me how to lead the spotlights. I really had butterflies in my stomach when I was responsible for the lightening! It was marvellous! But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers back stage! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography. What do you reckon? I can hardly await your reply! Lot's of Love, ",36.0
295," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to let you know  our unbelievable experiences which we had when we went to the theatre to see the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW.' First of all, I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because of sick. It made me disappointed very much. Moreover, he made many mistakes. Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had done at a travel agency. Finally, I am going to write about the theater, the Circle Theatre. The show supposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Because of that, we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London. It was your responsibility. We would like you to pay back the fee of the show and pay us  that hotel's fee as well. I would recommend you to show that the restaurant is closed on Monday. I could not have dinner. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in, most of them would answer 'clothes'. In these days, new fashions have been passing by very quickly. From my point of view, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin. For example, short skirts and tops like an under-wear. I think young people would wear smaller clothes which  they look like  almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick. It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves. Next, I predict about patterns of clothes. The animal-pattern is catching up now. It might be possible that the fish-pattern come up in 100 years. However, fashion changes too fast to predict. I think fashion changes very quickly so that people are interested in those changes.

You could do so many things because you received a free-pass which allowed you to go where you wanted and it was what I had prefer about this experience. I really enjoyed to serve the drinks to the pop-stars. You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were still in the sky. And you heard the concerts too. After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people were like pigs. But I was chatting and laughing with other workers. One more word! If you can have the chance to do it too, do it! It was a very positive experience. I didn't regret it and I want to do it again! Write  me soon. Love, ",28.0

I would like to travel only in July, because I will have  holiday  that time. I'm always having holidays in July it is my favorite time for holidays. For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents, because I use to go  tents  holidays, I like it. From  activities which you offer to me I choose swimming and tennis. I am very good in swimming. I do this sport since I was  child and I really enjoy it. I'm not so good in tennis but I would like to play it for practise. Also I find that it sport is very usefull for my health and does me feel better. It is all about me. I would like to ask you something. At first, which kind of clothes  I need take with me, because I don't know anything about the weather in California, and at tend how much money I will need. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people likes to do shopping. I hate it. I never liked shopping. It always was  trouble for me. I don't like to have many things in my house, I don't like to have many clothes and shoes, and I don't know what else. Just  nesseccary. I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they havn't  interests for  spirit (?),  intelect life. They are loosing time of their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things like sport, reading, chating about ideas which make our lives better.

If it is possible, I would like to travel in July. I will be working until the end of June and I am going to start university in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because, in my opinion, it is easier to make friends and I like camping as well. I have chosen photography and climbing for  activities. I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in . I have a medium level  in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains. Can you tell me how much money I have to take, if I have to take winter clothes and if it is possible to rent a car there. Thank you for this opportunity. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  I like shopping. Some people when they are tired relax  spleeping, reading a book or watching television but not me. Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing. I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one in this case. There were always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent one hour in the shop whithout buying anything. However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles. In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm and noisy place. In conclusion, you have to know when and where to shop quietly but in my opinion spending money in a crowded shop is the most enjoyable thing in the world. ",34.0
263," Dear Madam or Sir I am writing this letter to complain  how terrible the show performed in your theatre was. I was interested in the advertisement about the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago. However, I cannot help saying that it was really  nightmare. Firstly, you advertised that Danny Brook, who is the my favorite, is a main-actor but there was another actor insted of him. Furthermore, his performance was really poor. Secondly, it started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes later than on time and there was no discount for the ticket, which is different from the advertisement. Thirdly, the only one restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovating it. As a result, I had a totally disappointing evening during my holiday. So, I hope that you should have my money back. I will looking forward to your reply. Yours faithfully, TYUNG, SURIPHAT  [SEP]  It is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days. But how  it affect to my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of  radio program not the sound of  alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. In the bus or even in the tube, I can talk with a friend with a mobile phone when I feel boaring. Sometimes I even do some games with it. In accordance with study or work, I use a internet, which is the easist way to get informations  all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects a lot to my daily life as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the amount of it's affection to the human life would be more than this in the future. ",28.0

When I went to London, during my holiday, I decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW. During and also after the show lots of disappointing thing turned up. Firstly, it was not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove who acted, it was someone else. Sacondly, in your advertisement I read ""Times 14.30 and 19.30"". In fact the show started  20:15 Thirdly, I also read ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"", but the restaurant was closed because of painting. Last but not least, it also says ""discounts available"", but there was not any staff there who could do it. So I am sure that you will understand why I feel so frustrated and disappointed about the whole thing. I look farward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me the money back. Yours faithfully Maris Svensson  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I was reading when I suddenly hard a big bang.

""I am hear to help you. I only need to touch your teacher and you never need to do any homework again."" I could not belive my ears. It was the happiest moment of my life. I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my main-teacher walking through the door with the being after him. The being moved its hand farward and..... Then I felt a big pain in my head and heard ""You can't sleep in the lesson"". I looked up and saw my friend with the coursebook in her hand. Immediantely after I heard ""And don't forget your homework"". I looked at the book and read: ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets"" ",24.0

The advertisement said that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor  was different. Who can believe it? You are really a funny theatre. And  the time too. You wrote that at 19.30 the musical started. I was waiting for 45 minute. the show started at 20:15. I paid 20 pounds without any discount. You said that some discouns was available. Nobody took a discount. When I went to the reastaure I was really suprised. It was closed and I steel don't know why? In the advertisemen you wrote ""your perfect evening out"", that's very funny.

At the present day, for ecsample, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very big part of that have also  internet, the new frontier of computers evolution. If I look back in the past I can find that  computer is following the same street of television,  telephon and a lot of other things, that now the biggest part of  population have at home.

First of all, I believe that it was very interesting, but there were few artists than I have expected. In fact they came from six countries. I wonder if it is possible for next year to have more artists and also bigger concert halls. In fact I have noticed that some concert need to more space. I would be grateful if, next year, you could put more art exhibitions (with more pictures) in the program. I was very interested in the ticket of Festival. It was not expensive and  easy to use, because it was only one for all the events. I would offer you one suggestion that concers the classical concerts. I think it would be interesting to invite young compositors to hear news from the classical music. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Magda, how are you? Well, I hope. I'm O.K. I've just received your letter and I'm going to reply to your questions. In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools. For example, we have to wear in  appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers. At this time, in my school there is a new rule. We aren't allowed to use the mobile phone in class. Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster. And now about my home. I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time in which my family can eat together. For me, it's very stressfull and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like cheat with my class mates after our lessons. I'd like to change a rule at home. I'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m. It's a boring rule. Neighbours have complained about loud music. Write to me soon about news in your life. Love ",23.00

The Festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all  the world. Furthermore, and for sure it is not your fault, some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall that was often two crowded. I hope next year plays and films will be more and that the ticket will be reasonably-priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival. Friendly  [SEP]  Rome 16th December 2000 Dear Marie, I'm going to write you about rules in my country and I have to tell you that life in school isn't too hard because even if there are many rules to follow nobody does it. It's written in the regulament that we can't leave the school during the breaks; we can't smoke near the classrooms; we had to justify our absences or late-enterings and even if you're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher. At my home every rule must be respected. Even if my parents don't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you don't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends  for a Saturday night party.

Most people like shopping. Especially it is one of the hobbies for women. Basically, shopping is fun, but is it always enjoyable? There are some advantages when people go shopping. They can refresh, reduce ther stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted. Moreover, if they buy some nice things at  sale, they must be very satisfied. However, shopping sometimes make them stressfull. People often waste money for unvaluable things. Then, they really regret it. On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one. In addition, a shop assistant gives them a wrong advice. To sum up, there are many disadvantages as well as advantages. If people want to enjoy shopping, we must consider before buy something - do I really want it? I also recommend a window shopping. It is the best way to enjoy shopping. You do not have to waste money at all. ",27.0

My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was  most exciting job. Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite artist and her hobby. I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing puzzle alone. She seemed to be  very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had  very gentle attitude when she spoke to me. I became a fan of her. It was  very interesting experience for me. I wish you were there. But don't worry Kim, I'll send you a copy of her CD for you. I hope you can enjoy . Anyway it's the time to go to bed. Take care of yourself, Kim. I'm waiting for your letter.

Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15. Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor . Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor. We saw the musical in sadness. Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner. To our surprise the restaurant was closed because  the lack of staff to keep it open. It was certainly not a perfect night out.

Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that. I gave it a thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind from plastic-fabrics. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes. I mean when the earth's getting warmer and warmer because of an pollution that we people cause  the world. Maybe in the future they'll find out a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine. Maybe everybody will end up wearing shorts and skirts. Strict suits will be transformed into a school-uniform-like shirt and knee-lengthed shorts. Anyway we defenately now that they're going to change.

The show had to started at 19:30 and I arrived before, frightened  not to find a good place to see ""my hero"". I have waited for the show beginning until 20:15!!!! Is it a correct thing? I was getting angry, but, finally, the show started and I became quiter. BUT.. when I saw that the actor wasn't Danny Brook but a different one, I was very disappointed. So, after the show, I would like to have a good meal in the ""famous theatre restaurant"" (that, of course, was closed for a free night!!!!) At the end, I asked for  money back (and paiment for my orrible night): do you think anybody  give me back something?!

If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comfort (born just in the ""industrial age"") everything had to be done by hands or by animal work: I think in that time life was really  harder than now! We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society ""their good fruits"" but, at the same time,  negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or ""green"" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize are the main problems of our society. I know I'm  ""daughter of this techological world"" and unluckly I think I could'n stay without it: it's rather strange that today there's already somebody without  phone, dishwasher, TV...

Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable, when you need to buy something you have to look for the best price, what is always a work of time, and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper, it must be crowded. The solution can be in a alternative way of making shops like  Internet. You can by anything without  problem, this is a good thing although this prevents poor people from shopping by  Internet, because you have to have a computer. Anyway, other alternatives of shopping are being created and we can choose for not waste our time shopping. ",26.0

Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need. Please write soon Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. As a housewife I have a good idea about it. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go two days We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not. I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday  is not the same. Shops are so crowded and it takes  long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we got to face a long queue in order to pay. Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people. I find it very tiring sometimes. Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually much more money we spend than we expect. We can't do anything about is. We have to face it - it has both sides. Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday. ",29.0

I like staying in tents because when we go on holiday with my friends, we always stay in tents, so I am used to staying in tents. Moreover, I have also been asked to choose some activities. I would like to choose basketball and swimming. When I was at school, I have been playing for the school team and I am good at swimming. Finally, could you let me know what sort of clothes would be better to bring. It would also be useful to know that how much money will be enough to bring. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: Mr. J. Y  Head Teacher From: Re: Short Video About Daily Life at I.S.O. School. FINDINGS I have discussed with my friends and school teachers about this subject. Here are some information about daily life at I.S.O. Morning Lessons: Although there are a lot of classes, there is  special FCE class in which students are being prepared for  FCE exam. There are special methods and materials for students. Afternoon Lessons: The aim of the afternoon lessons is to be able to give ability in speaking. There are some discussion groups, so students may have  discussion on any subject. Break Time: We have a lot of facilities for break time. These are computer, video, and sports. RECOMMONDATIONS In my opinion we should choose break time activities. Because there are a lot of activities which students take part in. It would be much better for video film. ",29.0
1241," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you, in order to let you know all the information you have asked for. First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, Main-Road 21, which is situated not far from our college. I'd suggest you to walk, it will only take you about seven minutes. Just follow Main-Road until  to reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road. The college is a huge, yellow building - you can't miss it. Secondly, you have required information about the end-of-conference party. It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight. All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well. The location of the party isn't fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival. There is no need putting on special clothes for the party, casual ones should do it as well, for we want everyone to feel comfortable. Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you to visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested) Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need. I'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone, a blessing. Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it. Take me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say ""Sorry, I must cancel our meeting"", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it? Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on. Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so. So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention. ",40.00
33," Dear Jane Clark With attendance to the annual international arts festival which you took place on 21 and 22th November 2000, I spend  tremendous two days enjoying some features. Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations. Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there were some variety of features in it. Next, One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also  fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket. However, according to my notes, there are some doubt in the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact. The number of plays and films were also very few. In addition to that some concert halls were too small  to enjoy the concerts. On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars  more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place. I would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Albert Thanks for your letter, it was great to hear from you. I know you're fine, but I've been very busy studying because I have to take  exam next month. So this is  quick note to tell you what you want to know, as you asked about school rules and house ones. At school, the most horrible one is  school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes, colourful shoes and colourful socks. We can't also turn our hair colour an have to keep  hair length above  eye blows. Next, we're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we've students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them. However, at home I'm quite free. Just I can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I'm not allowed to play computer games  over two hours. These  are not so strict that I can stand them. I don't think I want to change them. Anyway, that's all about my  information which you want. Write soon, I look forward to hearing from you. Love ",33.00
246," June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show 'Over the Rainbow' permormed on the Circle theatre last week. To begin with, there were no discounts available, and nobody seemed to be able to explain the reason . Second, the musical started forty-five minutes later! and, to make matters worse, the actor was not Danny Brook as the advertisement said. The new actor was not as good as Danny Brook, and he did not perform  the show as he should have done. Finally, I found that the theatre restaurant was closed because there had been problems with one of the ovens. What was suppoused to be a perfect evening out turned  to be  disappointing one instead. I am afraid something should be done about this, and I urge you to refund my ticket. I am looking forward to receiving your response. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is often said that technology has changed our lives in many ways, and that we live better now. However, technology has also brought many problems to Society. Technology brings  me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier. If I want to know how a friend is, I just have to phone him; I can see how the world is going on only by switching on the television, and I can cook in  some minutes using the Microvelle oven. However, there are a lot of negative aspects in the way that technology affects my life. As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job. In conclussion, I think that technology has two faces which affects my life as well as everybody else's life. I believe that we should try to change this bad aspects, or learn to live with them.

87," Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to complain about my deceiveful experience at your theatre last Saturday night. What I thought it was going to be a wonderful night became into the worst night at the theatre I've ever had. Firstly, I must admit that when we realised the main character had been changed we felt really disappointed. This is because I had been waiting to enjoy Danny Brook's performance since I saw him the first time on television. Secondly, despite of your advertisement of the possibility of discounts, when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole prize. Moreover, not only had the actor been changed but also the musical show started forty five minutes late. In my opinion you ought to be more serious because of the commitent you have  with the people who comes to your theatre. Finally, at the end of the night we felt a bit hungry but we couldn't eat until  arriving home due to your restaurant new cooker illness. The truth is the night wasn't my perfect night out as you have announced so I would appreciate  if you could give  my money back. I wait to receiving a prompt answer from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had always thought that I could rely on her whatever my problem was. Yet, one extremly hot day while I was pacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems I discovered my elder brother's girlfriend with another boy. At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen. Nevertheless, when I found him studying harder for his final exams I realised I would rather her girlfriend explained my poor brother the truth. But the thing is I needed to speak to someone about the fact so I could feel more relaxed. I didn't know who explain it to but actually I decided that if I needed to tell someone a secret I would trust an my best friend Pat. So, the next day, I nervously came to Pat's appartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen. After that, she felt completely sad because of the love she had been feeling for my brother for several years and she swore  me that she was going to tell it to nobody. However, the truth was that not sooner had I arrived home than my brother asked me crying why I had told his girlfriend's affair to Pat instead of discovering him the truth. ",31.0
415," Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to ""the Circle Theatre"" looking forward to watching your musical ""Over the rainbow"". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-five minutes later. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles with buying a ticket before: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing . This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything   had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced  to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)  [SEP]  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" I heard somebody say ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death. The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping  to the line where the fish is on. The reader feels with him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up. Although this situation might not  very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.  ",37.0
36," Dear Ms Clark, I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me -  dances shows were absolutelly wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dances shows.  Dancers worn nice clothes,  the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefere them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all  plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably  ticket for all  evants because we could change our planes during the evant. I suggest to organize  next IAF in the summer. We are both students so we have our holiday from July to September. We have more free time in the summer. We're going to attend  IAF any time, as well. Thank you for an unusual event Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Monte, I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. At first - we have to be at time. Our lessons start at 8 a.m and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear the school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most of studenst wear jeans and  sweaters. We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school-bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. It is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we have good marks at school they let us to go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary. We aren't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol. We aren't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers It is also horrible. We musn't talk to them but  only listen to them. I'd like to change it. Student's life is hard but sometimes funny. Love ",30.00
902," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan: I have received your letter bout the competition and I am very glad about it. I would like to travel on July, please, because that  when I am in vacation. That is really the only time I have, unfortunately. I would love it if I could be accommodated in a tent. I'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations, such as getting lost in a forest, and I think being in a tent will be very usefull for that. I'd also like to get in touch with nature, and that is a great way . About the activities listed on your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've  in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too. I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade. I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you will, in which I also play the guitar. I would like to know how cold it is up there, for me to know what kind of clothes I should bring. Yours truthfully Benedito Alencar  [SEP]  Dear Kim, There was a huge Madonna show in a soccer stadium here in São Paulo. The most amazing thing is that I helped on it! I helped  setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer,  tidy up Madonna's room! I helped with the selling of the tickets, with the security, with the designing... But the unpredicted  was that I actually got to meet Maddy, and talk to her for almost one hour! The Material girl's the sweetest person in the world, totally unlike  the media says . Mo' told me everything about her new album, ""Music"", and how the single with the same name had slipped into the Internet in the UP3 format. She sang to me part of the album's second single, ""How it feels like for a girl""! Her daughter, Lourdes Maria, is such a pretty little girl, that I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Her boyfriend, Guy Richie, was there too, and he's a really good person. This is something I will never ever foget. The show after was great. I couldn't believe that I had met that superstar that was dancing in front of a crouded soccer stadium. Hope you enjoy the pictures,  got one autograph for you. Yours faithfully, Benedito. ",36.0
766," Dear Miss Ryan, I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me on the letter. First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month  summer vacation that is in July. I appriciate it if it will be the first two weeks of the month. Next, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I need to have a time to relax when I travel. Therefore, I would prefer a log cabin. For activities, my first choise is basketball. I have been playing it since I was nine years old. In high school, I was in a school team and I enjoyed playing it with my team mate, even though we were not a strong team. My second choise is golf. I had never played it until last month. However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a biginner, so I would like to practice and have fun at the camp. Lastly, I would like to know whether I should bring some money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Thank you for giving me this great opportunity. I will be expecting to hear from you. Yours sincerely, Hideo Kojima  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I've got your letter yesterday. I enjoyed reading how you spent time with your family and had fun at the Park. Thank you. As I have told you, I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty, a local band in which one of my friends played guiter. He knew that I'd wanted to work at a concert hall, possibly as a lighting technician. So he suggested me to help  their concert so that I could know behind the scenes. When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought me to a room. He explained  me that it was to controll the light. It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights. However, when it came to the real concert, it was very hard. When the concert was finished, I was exhausted but happy. I'll write you back. Friend, ",27.0
204," Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening to your theatre. and I would like to explain what the problems were. Firstly, as I read at the advertisment,  the actor would be Danny Brook and this is one of the reasons why I came to the theatre. But at  big suprise  I saw that the actor was different and I was very disappointed. Secondly, on the article the times were 14:30 and 19:30. I prefered to come at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the theatre started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting  to start. Another reason why I was disappointed was that you said there would be  discount available but there wasn't. At last I was waiting to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken. This was very disappointing. As you can see there were many problems with the theatre and I would like to ask for some money back as an alternative Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The next morning at school everybody was looking at me with a strange way. Nobody was talking to me except the ten persons who I invited to my party. At first I didn't know why but after a few seconds I realised that telling Pat about my party wasn't a good idea. I was very ungry with her, I didn't know what to do I was afraid that I would have lost all my friends. After a few seconds of thoughts I went straigh to Pat. ""Why, why did you do that?"" I said she looked as if she didn't want to talk to me. I ignored her I couldn't do anything now. Everybody knew about my party and I had invited only ten persons. I was confused. I wondered why I made the mistake  to invite Pat. I guess I didn't know that she would have said it. After a big confusion I decided not to make a party for my birthday so I could had all my friends back. And that's what I had exactly done even if I stayed alone at my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back. With this story I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends and who you can trust. ",33.0
179," Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" I am writing to  with the intention  to give you an impression of our experiences visiting the above mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apologation. We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that ""perfect evening out"". We would like to ask you if there is any chance  to get our money back of or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.  [SEP]  ""The old man and the Sea"" Dear Tim, I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II  always on the search for answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"". I hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know! I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards M. S. ",36.0

This is what happened: when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery, then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the courtines (opening and closing) when Nick came  to me and ask me to go on stage with him, my heart started beating very hard.

448," Dear Sir, I'm writting to complain about your theatre and its last night show. Firstly I would lice to say that I am very dissappointed with the show and that I didn't have the perfect evening out, as you had advertised. I have no idea from where to start. The main character of the musical show, which I'd like to say wasn't the ""BEST"", was awfull. His act was not good and he didn't seem like acting Even my son could act better. After the horrible act of your star, it comes the starting ours. I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I didn't. Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef and the waiters where on holiday. You could hire other  to do the work. I was very dissappointed what else can I write. It was suppose to be my perfect everning out. But it wasn't. I will ask  my money back. In Conclusion I'd like to recoment that you should, first, know what you have to offer and the advertising it. Yours sensirly Helena.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I shouldn't have told her that my dad had physcological problems. I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell it to my brother. It all started when I was about 10 years old, like my brother  now, and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems, to my aunt. I was hurt inside and cried till my tears run dry. I couldn't accept it. All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend. I was leaving in a lie. Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake  to say, this problem to my ""friend"" Pat. I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot, so I never thought that things could turn  like this. When, one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about the subject of my father and his problems. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was realy going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He stand outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised it, it was too late. The secret was revilied. And now I try to help my brother beaus I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels. ",28.0
285," Dear Sir, Re: The Musical Show Presented by the Circle Theatre With the reference of the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000, I, as a consumer, who is a musical show avid and a great fans of Danny Brook, who is said to be stared in the show, would like to complain about the presentation. 1. First of all, I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook. whose name was stated on the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be. 2. The Price of the ticket was said that there would be discounts available. However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show. 3. I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to the shortage of food sold. I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off. With all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return. I would consider to bring this complains to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explaination from the theatre. Thank You. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past, now and also in the future. However, things re recycling from time to time. So do the objective of wearing clothes. I will imagine that, people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past. The people in the past wear clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind. On the other hand, the people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is  result of a developed and full-grown country. I think people in the future will likely to wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided. It is because of the increasing number of  population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere. They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective. All the above ideas are needed to make them bare no burden when wearing these special designed clothes. The future is a hope and a dream for everyone in the earth. Therefore, I will suggest that we all nov to keep the enviroment clean and healthy for the next generation. ",29.0
194," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITTING IN ORDER TO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE OFFER. I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME, UNFORTUNETELY, THINGS WERE VERY WRONG. FIRSTLY, IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK, AND THAT WAS FALSE BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR. THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. SECONDLY, THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGH, THAT IS FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE. LASTLY, AFTER THAT AWFULL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, OF COURSE, I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE. AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT WASN'T MY PERFECT EVENING OUT (AS YOU PROMISE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT), SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. YOURS FAITHFULLY INGO SANOU  [SEP]  UNFORTUNETELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED IT TOO LATE. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE, I WOULDN'T TOLD HER THAT I HAD DISSAPROVE MY MATHEMATICS EXAM. LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUE WITH MY MOTHER. SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS, SO MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD. I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD. AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CONCERT OF CHARLY GARCIA. THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN FRIDAY, WICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS. I REALLY WANTED TO GO, AND I KNEW THAT MY EXAM WAS NO GOOD, SO I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD GET MY QUALIFICATIONS THE NEXT MONDAY, SO MY MOTHER ALLOWED ME TO GO. THAT FRIDAY, I KNEW THAT I HAD DISSAPROVED THE EXAM, AND PAT KNEW IT TOO. OF COURSE, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT TELLING THAT TO MY MOTHER, BUT PAT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD IT TO MY MOTHER, WITHOUT ANY INTENTION . AS A RESULT, I WASN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO THE CONCERT, BUT PAT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS GREAT. ",28.0
76," Dear Mrs. Jane X, I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been . First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think  should be bigger for jazz, rock or still classical concerts. Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year events, such as : - Funny plays and films to spend the break time; - Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night, - Art exbitions to know  more things about  artist's lifestyle; and - talks by writers to say how good is his latest book. In addictions, the ticket's price is too expensive and  difficult to buy another one every day, so, I think  is more effective if  was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. In conclusion, I hope  will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before. Sincerely  [SEP]  How are you? It was nice to receive  notices about you. I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much. Well, about rules in my contry,  is not different than another countries. The rules must be respect for all people if you don't want get out from scholl. You must to be organise, clean and respect the right of other people.. ",12.00
71," Dear J. Clark, I'm writing in response to your advertisement about the annual international arts festival. I really think it was a great idea to organize such a festival in our city as there are lots of people fond of art over here. I'm sure they are all very grateful to you now. I've already been to the festival and I think it's really important to let people see artists from all over the world. It would be wonderful if there were stars from more than six countries next year, the festival would be even more interesting then. I also think the places you have chosen for the classical concerts were not good sometimes, some of the halls seemed to be too small. But your idea about the weekend ticket is just excellent, people from the whole country get the opportunity to visit your festival and see all the events you are offering. I've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival. You could probably show a little bit more films and interviews with the most interesting artists. I'm sure it would attract lots of young people. Well, thank you very much for this festival, my friends and I have enjoyed it a lot. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Dave, Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you. Howe are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk bout our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow. Hope it will be interesting for you. Bu the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teaches don't let us smoke of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest. We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches. As for our rules at home, it's always different and depends just on your family. My parents are not very strict as you know and I appreciate them for giving me freedom. They understand that I can make my own decisions, but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother nay time we need it. I think the only rule in my house is to care bout each other. I hope to hear from you soon ",38.00
1087," Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to say ""thank you"" for this London trip plan. We are really excited about it. Especially the boat trip on  river  is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich. We also enjoy the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus. It seems it's going to be a great fun. I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in ""Time Out"" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convinient - March 14 -, and it is on   Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there. As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about English culture besides the language itself. Joining this fashion and leisure show, we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things, such as new hair styles and make up ways, or what is  fashion in London recently. Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another chance to go to the Science Museum in any other day, but this show is just for this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope, it wouldn't cause a trouble to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although human is a social creature, all people need an area  to be able to stay away from other people. This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life. Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others. It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit. Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. Press takes this demand as an order, and ""but  public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people. In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend too much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quiet sure,  even the ones, who have chosen their occupies just to be famous, don't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone. The situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this. Obviously, there is no point in saying ""famous people have a right to their own live."" Although this statement is absuletely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will  keep living with journalists. ",34.00
1150," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I read your letters and I'm ready to help you. I think that we have to think  which hotel is better for the students. I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me. I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it's very nice and cheap. It has comfortable bedrooms and  place for parties. You can book this hotel it's the best and it's near to  conference it's only 15 minutes by walk. I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance. The party it will be nice. The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart, not how you are going to  casino for example but nice casual, not with sports shoes or T-shirts. On the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places. Those are my ideas for the conference. I hope that you will like it. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Today our article it will be about an inventions that we need inour life. I think that all this things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things. First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make  call if you need something of if it something happend to your house and nobody is next to you. The second one is the lamp, the electricity that is very important in our life. In the past the people didn't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire. It's important to have electricity because without this you can't do anything. The other one is the television. You must have  TV because you can liten  what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you didn't go . You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have  free time. The boat it's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places. The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want. In this year the familys they have 3 cars in one family one by one person. For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you can't do anything, it's part of my life. ",21.00
1161," Dear Mrs Maria Smith: I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for. the group has been booked into the Harris hotel. this hotel is very good placed. From there you can get a taxi, catch the  buses seven and eleven, wich both have you very close to the conference place, and also you can go by underground to get there. the conference starts at 5:30 pm and it finishes at 8:00PM. Then, after the Conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, wich starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM. this party is a formal one, so you should  be casual dressed. In this area you could visit the central park. It is very beautiful and a very good place to relax. Another place that would be interesting to visit is the old cathedral of the city. I hope these information could be useful for you. Yours Sincerelly  [SEP]  Hampton Court Palace Introduction: I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit. I went to Hampton Court last year, and I think it is a great place to visit. Location: Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court. In addition to that, I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty. transport: to get to Hampton Court palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo train station. From there depart the trains to Hampton Court. Moreover, I think  by train is the best way to get there, because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace. Price: there is a great price for children, students, adults and families. They are between three and six pounds each. Conclusion: Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see. And also it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it. ",24.00
1187," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter which I received last week. If  student is ill, we will return the money but you should tell us untill one week before we start. And you are staying  the Palace Hotel, which is located in  town Centre. You can take buses or our school buses. It costs forty pence. If you take public buses, it costs more expensive than  school bus. The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock. One of our teacher, who will be voted by student is making  speech for one hour. After,  student is making  speech about what he or she have learned. and diner. In my opinion, you should wear normal cloth. I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on  sixty second floor. There are eye-max cinema, museums,  garelty. This is very famous in our city. I hope that my advice will help you. I look forward to hearing soon from you.

696," Dear Mrs Ryan Many thanks for your letter. I would like to travel in July because I have got  summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August. I think a tent would suit my personal life-style better than a log cabin because I love the nature. I would like to play basketball during my holidays at Camp California because I love this game. I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball-team. But I have never played golf in my life but with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting. I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experience I made. At first I had to clean the three private rooms of the stars. This was very boring but after I left the third room I met Brunner and Brunner. These two people are stars in our country... O.K. I am just kiding. I don't like the songs of Brunner and Brunner because this kind of music is very boring. I also had to clean the washing rooms. I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert . But after this serville work I met Eminem. I think you know his popular songs like ""My Name Is"". It was one of the greatest moments in my life. I had to bring him something to eat. It was a hard but also a funny work. You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. ",30.0
288," To the manager of The Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam Last weekend I was in London on holiday. I had looked forward to go and see ""London's newest and best musical show ""-Over the Rainbow. I must say I was rather disappointed by the experience. I am a great admirer of the actor Danny Brook, who was supposed to be starring in the musical. Surprizingly there was a complete different actor starring. Very disappointing! According to your advertisement the musical was supposed to start at 19:30. For some unknown reason it did not start until 20:15. I was looking forward to take benefit from the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available. After the show I had planned to have dinner at the Theatre Restaurant. Unfortunatly the restaurant was closed. I bought a ticket to have a ""perfect evening out"" during my holiday. Indeed it was not a perfect evening out. Therefore I think the least I can ask from you is to give me the money back for the ticket. Sven Reitgard  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemingway Dear Sara I have heard that they will read ""The Old Man and the Sea"" on the radio P1 on Wednesday next week. It is a book written by Ernest Hemingway. I would really recommend you to listen to it. The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple. It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish. He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched. On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eats his catched fish pice by pice. The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons, but when he reaches port there is only  head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it. I really think you should take your time and listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week. Best regards Sven Reitgard ",34.0
561," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am really surprised about the free journey to California, because I've never ever won anything before. My summer holidays last for two months, but I just have time in July. In August I am going to work in an office, so there is not possibility  to travel away this month. I would prefer the accommodation in a log cabin. For one night it would not disturb me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable. At the Camp I would like to go sailing a lot. Once my family and I went to Greece and rent a sailing boat for three weeks. Because most of the work did my parents, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat. As the second activity I have chosen to make photos. I'm used to be the photographer at the holidays with my family and I know how a camera works. Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and how much money I should estimately take with me. I just want to know, what I will have to pay  alone. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to discover a new type of landscape! Yours  [SEP]  The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found  you should take everything you like and go into the cabin. It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity. After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly. At the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are all the work worth. ",28.0
818," Dear Madam, I have just received your letter and I am glad to be the winner. Firsty, I would like to thank you warmly for this great prize. Here are some  information and details you requested: Concerning the dates of the stay, I will only be able to come during the first two weeks of July, because I am starting a new job on July 15th. Since I have some serious back problems, I would prefer a cabin for sleeping . About your activities, I have picked basketball, because I love it: I am a player in a local club and I have been playing for twelve years, so I guess I am a ""good"" player. I have also chosen photography in your list: that part of California must be beautiful and I would love bringing  some ""well-taken"" photos of the area. Lastly I need to know if all meals are included in your package. I am looking forward to joining you at Camp California Yours faithfully Zacharie Gibson  [SEP]  We decided to make a short film about our school being seen and showed through the eyes of an imaginary student. It will be called ""A day in the life of the mysterious student X."" It will be shot just as if the viewers were student X, not seeing him but being him. He will have breakfast, take a shower, get dressed, etc...  So  viewers will. Student X will meet friends on his way to school and start talking with them. Actually one of us will hold the camera while another will stand next to him, as the ""voice"" of X. At school we want to show ""sights and sounds"" from all  lessons (about 5 minutes each). Student X will answer questions, speak with his classmates, even cheat at an exam! During the chemistry and biology classes, ""we"" will make experiences. Of course we will also show other activities such as PE the lunch break and the theater workshop. The main purpose is to show the ""real"" life of an unreal student. Therefore we want this film to be informative and funny as well. We expect to show our production during the graduation party. ",30.0
68," 16.12.2000y Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to you in connection with the advertisement in  newspaper. I would like to express a couple of thoughts that I have after the festival that I have recently seen. I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festivel, connected with art and culture. Especially the date was very suitable for me, as I have a lot of free time. What is more there was a wide vareiety of music Although the artists were supposed to be from all counties, there were only six nationalities. I hope that next year there will be much more possibilities to enjoy films or plays and that the halls will be bigger, as they were overcrowded. However I was really suprised that the entrence fee was so low. I have also one suggestion, if I may. Maybe next year the festival could be ended with  fireworks show. Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advices would occur useful. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Tom, Just I got your letter and sat  straight away to write  you a few sentences that will illustrate my opinion. To begin with, I'd like to show you how are my obligations at school. Although we have to change our boots, we don't need to wear special uniforms. Our clothes should be in a good taste. We are also allowed to have jewellery and a make-up, what's especially crucial for girls. When it goes to my home, I think I have  usual duties I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. However my parents aren't demanding, I have to be home at  least at 11 o'clock and tell them where I go out. In my opinion there's nothing special that I'd like to change,  maybe only this, that I wouldn't have to change my boots. I hope that it'll claryfy your questions and doubts. So, that will be everything as for now. I'm looking foreward to hearing from you. Yours ",26.00
294," Mr./Mrs Manager, I am writing to complain about a musical show I went  one week ago. Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour. To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts  as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy  the cheapest and worst seat available. As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance. I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the £10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame. Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Well, it's pretty simple to answer this. Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer, I didn't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games. The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and  evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them, I kept on stucked in front of the screen. Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC. After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed. I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web. My daily life would be harder without modern technology. ",35.0

I would like to travel in July, as it will be summer, and the weather will be nicer. Accommodation in log cabins would be better for me, because they are more comfortable. One of the activities I will do is tennis, but I am just a beginner, so I would like someone to teach me. The other activity will be photography, which I am very good at. I am wondering if there will be anywhere for me to wash my clothes, or if I will have them washed. I would also like to know how much money I should bring with me. I am waiting for your prompt reply. Yours sincerely, Bradley Tudela.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Many people enjoy going shoppings meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience. The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure, provided you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if these were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse. Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience. ",35.0

This would be an ideal opportunity for me to visit the United States to learn  the American way of life. First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my travel-holiday only on July. Secondly, I'd like to prefer to stay in tents, that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California. It could be very enjoyable.

964," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your requests. First of all, it would be suitable for me to travel in July only, because that is when I am on holiday from work. Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be unapropriate for me. I would prefer golf and surfing. I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent to do so. About surfing, I am an amateur at it. I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships. Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take. I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there. Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerately,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert. It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began. What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him. Bye! see you soon, ",33.0
393," Dear manager, My name is German Schmidt an in the last week I went in your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There are some problems, we have to speak about. At first, the actor was not Danny Brook there was a different actor, who I don't know. In the advertisement of the show  was written that the musical will be start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. After the musical show I want to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are in holidays. And this  not  perfect evening in your theatre was very expensive for me. I've payed £ 160 for eight people and there was no discounts available. In my oppinion you have to give some money back to me. I think 50% (£80) are enough. If you give no money back, I will go to the newspaper. faithfully  [SEP]  At first I would say that our technology level, in this  time are very high but in the future it would be higher. With the help of some modern technology our daily life would not  so difficult. One point in my life is home banking. With the help of my home computer I can do all  thing, about money, with my bank. Some years ago I have to go to the bank. The new way is very easy and faster and I can spent my time with other things. An other point is the modern technology in my car. Because of the modern technology, the safety level in my car is very high. At the end I would say that everybody of us can not live without the modern technology, because the modern technology is necessary for us in all parts of our life. ",21.0
124," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about a musical show which I've seen recently at your theatre. There are several reasones why I wasn't satisfied with it. Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor Danny Brook would play in the show. Despite it, a different actor stared in the performance, which was really disappointing. Secondly, the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be. Thirdly, no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets. Lastly, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show. That evening wasn't my perfect one out, although it was promised to be so in the advertisement. This is the main reasone, why I want to ask for a refund. In my opinion, this would be quite fair. I'm going to visit the Circle Theatre this Sunday. I hope I'll get at least a part of the money I've paid back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. During the centuries man's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more common clothes. I think we can make a conclusion: during the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common. People's clothes have been changing from metalwear to shorts and miniskirts. That's why I suppose, that man's clothes will be becoming more and more light. I think, they will be made of universal materials, which will be rather light and thin. People won't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies. Perhaps, clothes will be rather small. I think, that different tops and mini-skirts will become more popular. Maybe, people will create something even smaller than that. Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps, metalwear will become a craze again. ",25.0
801," Dear Helen Ryan. Thank you for your letter. I am so happy to win the prize and come true my dream. I would like to travel to California this July, because I can take an holiday from 14th to 27th of July. I would prefer log cabins. I have never used it and I think it would be more exciting than tents. I have heard that the Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time. Besides, I will take the chance to play golf. It is my only favorite hobby. What about clothes and money? I don't know what the weather is like, and you are paid for travel costs, but I am wondering that it is included two activities. Also, I have a dog. Can I go with him. Please, let me know  this questions as soon as possible. I appreciate your competition and I look forward to hearing your answer Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am sorry. This letter is late, because last week I took exams, so I was very busy. To reply  your answer, it was realy an nice experience. As you know, I like a pop music so much and  singer was one of my favorite singers. Also, in the future I'll want to be an organizer like  this concert, so it'll be useful the experience to me. I am writing  how I got the position and what I did. Firstly, I applied to a concert agency to help, because I had the experience before and I knew how to organize and what to do. In the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments. It was somewhat hard to me. After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again. If you have some questions, let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you With best wishes, ",28.0
742," Dear Mrs. Ryan, thank you very much for your letter. It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition, which means that I will have the possibility to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me. As request following you will find the information you need . First, I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for  holiday at that period and it would suits me very well. Secondly, I would prefer an accomodation in  tent because I enjyoi being outside close to the nature. Thirdly, what the activities concern, which I can choose, it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them! As I am very good at tennis and swimming I will choose these. I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad. and I am able to swim  every style. Finally, I have two questions. Please let me know which clothes do I need then and how much money in cash and as travellers cheque shall I take with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely E. Elmo.  [SEP]  Sometimes the bad charachters in a story are more interesting than the good ones. I completely agree with this statement. Recently I have red a short story written by Agatha Christie. His title was: ""The Mistery of Hunter's Lodge"". The charachter which I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering, the mistress. It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people: herself and the houskeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it. I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him. She was the head in this story. The plan was almost perfectly and the police hadn't discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot. In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense. Moreover she must have had an ""ice blood"" and strong nerves to handle  in that way. As far as I am concerned I would appreciate to have myself some of her characteristics, like take a decision and handle. ",30.0
604," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very glad for receiving such a wonderful surprise,  that I have won first prize. What a lovely opportunity to go to America! About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free for traveling due to I won't have classes at school by that time. In the matter of accommodation I'd rather prefer  log cabins, because I consider them better for resting and  know people. I also want to mention that it's great you have so many activities. The ones I consider I'm good at are painting and photography. I love nature and I'd like to record the Californian landscapes. I have something I'd like to ask you. Do I have to take any special clothes with me? How warm is California in those days? Another thing, should I have to take my camera with me for the activity at the Camp? I'd appreciate any further information you can give me. Looking forward to your repply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, It was quite nice to hear from you and your family in the last letter you sent me. Hope everybody is fine. And, yes! I helped my friend Jane at the concert! It was such a wonderful experiece! When Jane asked me to help her with the organisation of the publicity and specially with the inverviews, I just couldn't believe it. You know that I love going to concerts, but being  beging of all the show and in the staff as a member, was something I was always interested in. I never imagined how many people is involved in the organization ! In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys, all of us investigating, calling to radio stations, organizing the reporters, specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards... yet, it was an incredible satisfation when everything finished just fine! Wish you were there! But, I heard you went on vacations to Bermuda. Cool! How was it? You have to tell me everything! Looking forward to hearing from you. Love, XXX ",34.0

623," Dear Ms. Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am writing to give you further information about myself. First of all, July is the only month I can travel in because I will have to start working from August, and I would like to stay in a tent when I am at the Camp so that I can enjoy the great atmosphere which tents only can make and I love. I would also like to tell you which two activities I am keen to do at the Camp. One of them is basketball, which I have been playing for over seven years, and I am the captain of my university basketball team. The other one is tennis, which is also my favorite sports and I have been playing for several years. I go to elementary school to teach children how to play tennis every Wednesday and Friday. I am therefore writing to enquire about some things. What I would like to know is what the weather is like so that I can bring appropriate clothes and also how much money I should bring. Lastly, I would like to know how many people are comming to the Camp I will go . I sould be grateful if you would send me  further information that I asked  and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Makoto Tanaka  [SEP]  For a short video Introduction The aim of this report is to summarize the results of a survey about lessons and other activities which should be filmed. This report is based on a sample of over 80 students of my school. Favorite lessons Interestingly, over half of the students who were asked enjoy attending history class, while 30 per cent are keen to take an art and music class, and a small number of the student (less than 15 per cent) like to take social studies class. Favorite activities Not surprisingly, football was well-preferred as an activity which students do after school generally (over 30 per cent) and also about 25 per cent preferred baseball. Amazingly, over 20 per cent of the students would like to take up handball from next year. Conclusion To sum up, it seems that there are so many interesting lessons and activities at our school, ",29.0
722," I'm pleaseant to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA. As I'm an artist student in a particular College, I only can go to your Camp California in July, because in this month I got no  class, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like  log cabins as my accomodation, because it's safer and cleaner than  tents and I wouldn't share it to anyone. Painting and Photography are the activities good for me. They fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas. In Painting I talk about human beings in this world, in big canvases; and in Photography, with Collages, I talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines. So in Camp California I would like to keep me on touching to these areas. I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records. In summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks to not forget my artistic life.  [SEP]  Shopping is something made, which do not need to be enjoyable. We can analize when shopping is enjoyable,  when it is not. There is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves. It means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based in our relationship to another people, in the work or in the family. So we have enjoyable when we buy what we like following another people's views. On the other hand, sickness in ourselves  our relatives made us unhappy to buy. It is an obligation shopping  medicines, clothes to winter, doctor visites, and so forth. A death in the family is not also an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is the highest point of the sickness. Buying coffins and graveyards to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes. In summarizing shopping can be enjoyable or not depending of our healthy state. Giving examples:  we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves;  we are sick, or our relatives , we buy medicines  we  not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation. ",23.0
1084," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising  good programme,  especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days. I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give  the information of 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go  and to huggest our opinion. We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday 'The Times' edition of the show. It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall, London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. Firstly, it will introduce  latest fashions connecting Millenium. Secondly, we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year. It would be  fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion. Finally, we can see how to  make up and make better hairstyle in the show. Most of all, It is free for students to enter. We would like to know if it is possible to change your programme. We would be grateful if we could go there in the afternoon on 14 March because we are able to go shopping. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Whenever I recollet it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go to  Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going to  Army, I was able to apply to  Korea Auxiliary Police. One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul. Suddenly, the theft signal came into. So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly. When we arrived at the place which it happened, one man started running away. Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow. Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg. He fell down and we had to stare at each other. After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him. As a result, I could go on vacation. When I said to my mother, she asked me not to do it again. But, I was a police-man. Therefore, I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous. ",23.00
994," Dear Madam: I just receive your letter with the good news. I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June. For the accommodation I would like to have  log cabins rather than  tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy. I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities. I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers. Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget. Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food. On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family. I start thinking  what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost. In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort  choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depends on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested  to please.

927," Dear Mrs. Ryan Before answering your letter (which I have just recieved) about the prize of the competition I recently won, I'd like to tell you thank you very much for giving me the chance of gong to the USA. It is just a dream come true! I have been asked to say when I would like travel. There's only one month for that: July (as I am working all the year round and I am not available to leave my job). About the accomodation; I rekon I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable. During my two week sat Camp California, I'd like to practice climbing and surfing, whose  basics I know perfectly well. I am quite good at both because I do usually practice them. Furthermore, I love to go through such sports! In addition to this, I would like to know the ammount of money I should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that I will find there. Don't hesitate to contact me if there's any problem, and thank you very much again. Yours sincerely, Bola  [SEP]  Hi Kim! How are you? It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time... Hey, guess what: I gave a hand to a friend at a pop concert! It was great, and I got my entrance for free! It happened by chance: I was walking down the street when I bumped into Jane, my old friend, who asked me if I wanted to join her and a couple of mates to help at the concert. I agreed unwillingly, as I couldn't imagine how a pop concert looked like... but when I came in I changed my mind! None of the groups were known nowadays, but I belive they are well on their way to becoming famous bands. My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff, and stay there after the concert to clean everything. This was the best part because when everyone was gone, Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers!!! What was a fella like that doing in such a place? I couldn't belive my very eyes... Jane took a photograph of us toghether. I'll send you a copy as soon as I can. Lots of Kisses from Bola xxx ",33.0
38," Dear Jane Clark I went  the international arts festival which you organized. Most of the events were good, but I felt that the festival could be even better next year. So, may I give you my suggestions and opinions? I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea! But the stars and artists who are from around the world were from only six countries. You had better invite more nationarities' people. And some concert halls were too small, so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films in the next year than this year's. I think the idea of one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent! Because it does not complex, also we don't confuse. If you can improve these points, your festival must be better than this year's. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Johnny Thank you for your letter. Anyway, you want to know about rules at home and school in my country, don't you? My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed  many things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes  whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom in any time . Of course we can go out  the classroom in any time. But some schools in my country don't allow many things. One of the rules of my friend's school is not to drink and eat something during a class. And the students have to wear the uniforms, so they can't chose their clothes. Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back  my house until 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule! I really want to change this rule. Many of my friends have this rule. How about in your country? Love ",26.00
6," Dear Mr Jane Clark, My name is Rosa Santor. I'm 24 and I'm  student from Poland. I study architecture at the Polytechnics in Krakow. I'm very interested in art, specially in paintings and goings to galleries. I'm writting you a letter, because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival. I recently spent two days at this festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that  festival could be even better next year. It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion if this is an international festival, it would has more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like it was this year. It was  great idea for doing something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hall were too small for all  people, who took a part at that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also  a great idea was, that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. I think, as a person, who in this festival took place in, that this is excellent, because we can spend a lot of time with art. There is only one bad fhing, that this festival was too short. In my opinion next year it should take place  much longer than two days. I'm not looking foward to received  letter from you, because I know, that you are busy, but please look at my suggestion for next year's festival. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kathleen, I've been just receiving this letter for you, so I'm writting  you. I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years. You wrote that in your class, you've been talking about rules, both at home and at school. So now, I would like you write something about  school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. As you know I'm not a secondary school's student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Sathurday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there are a lot of drawings,  paintings and some other subjects doing by hands. We also learn how to design the interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons at the morning, till  afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all  class, for example next to the lake, and there we are paintings the nature. I don't have troubbles with my education, my friends and teachers are nice and friendly, but there is one thing I'd like to change in my school. I'd like to have more tests during the whole study, not only at the end, because it causes that I'm getting very lasy. I'm looking forward to received a new letter from you. I think, that you don't forget, & will write  me soon. See you soon, your best friend ",25.00

I could enjoy helping at a pop concert in last week which is ""The Max"". As you know, I am  big fun with ""The Max"". Can you believe it? I have got good experience and fantastic memory. At the same time I have got a small  money but it was not important for me. I was so happy. So, my templary job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer. I've just helped for  staff.

After that I was able to understand this system, time after time. Now, I  able to use  sound effect system.

With reference to the date, I only can go on July, as I'm going off on holiday on August, and I start university on September. The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more confortable than in a tent. It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities. The ones I'm most keen on are Tennis, in which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and Painting, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems. I think I'm not bad at painting either, at least everyone in my family likes my work, includying myself. Anyway, there are some questions I'd like to ask you: What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer, and how much money do you think I'll need? I'm waiting forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Manela B.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm so sorry I haven't written until now, but you know I'm always very busy. As I told you in my last letter, last month I worked for a pop band, and helped them at a concert in Barcelona. It was such a great experience! Basically my work was carrying the instruments, the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage, which is not an easy work because, as you can imagine, it's not exactly light stuff. But the most exciting part was meeting the band, mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good-looking. Anyway, I had  lot of fun working for them.

First of all I will be able to go   U.S.A  in July because of my university. I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays. My exams will have finished at the end of June. I will only be able to set off in July and I also will give my thesis to my teacher in August. This holiday will help me to think   and prepare it. I'd prefer staying in  log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study . Basically, I don't like staying in a small tent. When I get  the camp, I'd like to swim and climb. I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing. I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer. I'd like to ask some questions  which I want to know. Is there any toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby? Do I have to bring any special clothes? Do you have any idea what is the weather going to be ? How much mone do you recommend me to bring with me? Is the camp close to  town or city? Will you provide me  an instructor when I climb and swim? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I haven't written  you for ages. I do apologise for this. How are you? How is your new school and  parents? I hope we can catch up with each other's news. Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert. It was unbelievable and tiring as well. I saw all the pop bands and singers. I heard them talking behind the stage. They signed my diary and took a photo with me. Being a security guard was the hardest task. Carrying big speakers  place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh. Believe it or not I put make up on one famous singer's face. I was just walking down by  dressing room   manager said that if I could help them. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was in her room and helping her. Especially I liked that time. I advise you to do something like that. I'm going to help them again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, ",32.0
587," Dear Helen Thank you for my prize! I  never been in the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California. I can only have some holidays in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time, that is why I would like to travel during those two weeks. For the accommodation I would prefer to have  tents because I used to travel in Campsites and I love it during summer, just to change the customs!! Concerning those activities I have choosen two of them. I enjoy swimming and anytime I have  opportunities to swim I go. My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that  is better to join one sport and one ""soft leisure"" and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I don't know for my holidays. Please could you tell me about the weather if I need special clothes and about the money for the change if you don't mind. See you soon! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" ""Shopping today!""  You decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a ""shopping destination"", that is mean that you need something special for you or someone else. You have the money and the time as you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion  on yourself! and after that you can make a stop in the Duty-free  and buy some chipper souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with  money to buy that you always wanted to. But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend ask you to come for shopping, it should be boring! and you  become jealous against him and want him to do that quickly! or you  are going to get nervous! And you can find  too much people in  shops, it is too hot or you can not have your right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! or you decide to not spend  money in shopping today, but in front of the shop. What is going on?? So, you'd better to stay  home today... ",21.0
77," Dear Ms Clark, I am very glad to write to you. I spent two days at the International Arts festival you organised. I enjoyed most of the events I went to, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. Here are some opinions and suggestions: Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries. Additionally, some concert halls were too small to relax , while most of them were very comfortable. It was a pity for me that there were fewer plays and films than I had expected. I suggest to you that you should organise more next year. On the other hand, there were a lot that impressed me very much. For example, there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. It is a very good way to increase the number of music-lovers. Last but not last, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year. I enjoyed it very much. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Long long ago, there lived in a province of Bizen in Japan an old woman and an old man. They were eagar to have a child, but they had never been able to. One day, the woman went to the riverside, and found a peach floating in the river. She brought it to her house, cutting it  with her husband. To their surprise, there was a boy in the peach! They named him Momotaro, and looked after him. The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures. He made up his mind to defeat them, and asked his stepmother for some kibidango, one of traditional snacks in Japan. Having eaten the kibidango, he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him: a dog, a monkey and a bird. Reaching the island, he and his friends fought bravely against the devils. They finally succeeded n defeating the devils, and took back all the money and treasures. After that, they went home. All the people in Bizen including his stepparents met Momotaro and his friends with a great joy. This story happened a long time ago. ",31.00
440," Dear Mr. Smith My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' to the Circle theatre. Firstly I want to tell you how disappointing was that night. Everything in the advertisement for the show was wrong. The actors I saw in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I went at 19.30 and the show didn't begin until 20:15 so I had to wait a lot and I arrived late to a meeting I had after the show. There were not discounts available for the tickets and the theatre's restaurant was closed after the show because it was too late. So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent night. I hope you can understand me. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So in  very few days all the College knew that me and my friends were  who had crashed  headmaster's car. The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to close him in a little house, we had twenty kilometers far from the village until we could change his opinion. Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost his conscience. We put him in my car and we left him inside a closed room. When he woke up he started shouting and we had to make him calm. We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell this anybody because if he does we will hang the photos all arround the village. He accepted  and we left him  free. Everything began because he is a nasty person and he forced us to clean the college every day, for not paying a cleaning assistant. We need to do something like that to make him change. ",26.0
877," Dear Miss Ryan, I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much about that. Here is the information you want, I hope they are useful. First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June. And in August, I have to go back to school to do some classes work and I have got a camp to organise. So I would like to travel on July. Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation  in tents. Since I haven't been camping in tents so I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what will it be. About the activities, I chose swimming and climbing. I am in  swimming term a school and I won a prize last month. Although I'm not good at climbing, I want to experienced  myself. I would like to ask what is the weather in  USA like and what kind of clothes should I wear? And I was wondering how much money do I have to take? Also, if I can join climbing, what do I have to bring? At last thank you very much for answering my questions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was lovely to hear that you want to hear about my experience. I helped  the concert which was my favour singer's concert. I helped with the piano part in that concert. At the concert, I had to play 4 songs and I had never played in a concert before, so I felt very nervous before the concert. But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to claim down and play well in front of the audience  the concert. And also I have never played the piano with the singers before, and after that it makes me more confident and improved my skills a lot. When the concert finished my favour singer talked to me & they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed will in that concert. They taught me a lot about playing piano as well. At last thank you for sharing my experience. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes Yours sincerely, ",27.0
165," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you in order to complain for the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; concretely on Friday evening. First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion about your company, which is said to be the best exhibitor of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended  the referred day to your theatre with the aim of having a perfect evening. However, nothing was further from what really happened. In the beginning, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started. And finally, when it went on, we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing. I hope you realise this was totally different from what you advertised, and I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future offering me some money back. Yours faithfully, Jaro Santoquez  [SEP]  Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in. Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily life had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished looking  how our lifes are changing frenetically. We have hardly assimilated a new technology when it is replaced or modified by another. Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily life more comfortable and easier, but does it means that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free-time. However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stopping race. Machines do now most of  hard work, but this does not mean that we are working less. People spend more and more time working, searching for new inventions that will make life easier, but then fail to profit  all the obtained benefits. ",33.0
28," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about an annual international arts festival with a good impression. I have spent two days on it which was exciting. However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it. The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is  great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from six countries apart from your advertisement. I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events. The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic , which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for  audience, so a few people had to stand and watch  concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised. As well as that, I expect you plays and films are performed more. Even if the majority of my friends had a good time there I saw some people would anticipate it, because there were many people who were impressed in it. Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is a excellent price because when I am tempt to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand   other friends. That's how I am feeling about that. I expect you can be organised even better next year. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter. I could be interested in your letter. But it is quite different rather than you. Becoming more strict gradually at home that at school is true as you said. Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test. But most teachers consult with their parents, so it they behave wrongly it is true  teachers call their parents. Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on  weekend they have to help parents to do some chores. But people would like to change  life style in their house because there haven't been convenient appliaces in their house yet. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours ",23.00
668," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply to your letter. I'm very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition. Here there are the informations you require. First of all, I'm available for travel only in July because in August I'm going to attend a language course in France. As far as accomodation is concerned I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable, and, therefore, I have never stayed in a tent. The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis. I play basketball very well, although I have never taken part in important competitions; however, I am not very good at tennis, and I would like to improve it. Moreover I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money I have to take, and which clothes are better to be put on during the holiday. Yours sincerely Rita Pizzi  [SEP]  This report shows which lessons and activities are better to be filmed in order to make a short video about daily life at our school. It is based on interviews taken from over 80% of my classmates. First of all, according to the majority of them, latin and greek lessons should be filmed. In fact they find it difficult to take them in and, in their opinion, these lessons are the most important so as to show their daily life at school. On the other hand, about 3% of students suggest that also chemistry lessons should be filmed, because they often take place in the laboratory that the school has lately built; in fact some experiments might be filmed. Furthermore, some students would like to film the football school team, because football is the most practised activity by the students. To sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern their sportif activities as well. ",34.0

I would like to travel on July because of it is more suitable for me. I think I will really enjoy  if I could stay in  tents it is going to be a new experience and looks exciting. About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming, not because I am good in it, just because I  keen on  and the other one is Photography. As I never did this in whole my life could you tell me if we have to do our own meals or I can find everything ready to eat there? If no, what do you sugest? The same question for clothes and money. How much  I have to get in my pocket? I hope has had your questions out of your mind. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Cambridge 13.06.00 Dear friend Kim Last month, I enjoyed to help at a pop concert in Portugal. Everything were new for me. I had to (lyd) tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn. The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for  throat. Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels, I mean, dried towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh; don't ask me why. The pop concert happened in a big stadium called ""Mararcanã"". I just did not enjoyed  when they were making the instruments work for the big day. But what I particularly liked was see and ask  autographs from the rest of the others groups. Don't be jealous, I will make a copy for you, OK? Love ",24.0
114," Dear Sir/Madam, During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" but, unfortunately I was very disappointed. At first, as I have read in your advertisement, Danny Brook should have stared in this show. A different actor has appeared, but I must say that he was very disappointing. Secondly, you have written that the musical starts at 19:30. I had to wait for the show for over fourty five minutes, because it started at about 20:15! What is more, it has been written that I can get some discounts, but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket, it was impossible. You have also placed a note about your theatre restaurant opened after the show. I wanted to drink a coffee but, unfortunately it was closed, because the waiter went out! To sum up, I must say that this evening out was supposed to be perfect. It was not of course, so I would like to ask you kindly for my money back, because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At first, there are now a lot of things that most people use at home. For example: a fridge, a cooker or just an electricity. We couldn't imagine our life without them. Secondly, thanked to the technology, there are many ways of travelling today. We produce cars, trains and plains which are better and better. What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe it will be a remedium against AIDs or cancer soon. On the other hand, the modern technology has some disadvantages. The main  is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world. The second is the nuclear weapon and  many wars, in which modern equipement is used. To sum up, as far as I am concidered, modern technology has changed my life completely. On the one hand it helps me a lot in daily life, but on the other I'm afraid of the future everyday. ",26.0
839," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter and congratulations! I have always been interested in visiting other contries. In fact it didn't want to ask my parents for money, and going on holiday with you would be an ideal solution. I will be having my exams durind this month, so I can't travel before July. Also I'm going to meet a director of Smith'th Travel Agency for  interview concerning possible work with English-speaking tourists. As you can see, I will be available only in July. As regards accommodation, I would like to stay in tents, because I used to going on holiday with my friends and staying in tents. It is just wonderful. In my spare time I like to play basketball for a local team of which I have recently been made captain. I would now like to learn how to play tennis and golf, if it is possible. Could you please let me know what kind of weather will be there in July, what sorts of clothing I'd better take with me. Is there an extra charge for some trips, which might put them beyond my means. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Raisa Sharapova  [SEP]  To: Dinara Safina From: Raisa Re: Daily life at our school. As requested, it has collected some information about the school. Below is a summary of the most important relevent points with some recommendations. 1. The fully-equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are no enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increase the number of them, because it will be more exiting to film. 2. The school arranges an amasing range of activities, such as excuintions, sports and different kinds of trips. Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the most funny events happen while we are playing basketball and football. I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video. Conclusion. Our school is an ideal place for making a short video. There are many interesting lessons and other activities. I do recommend, however, to make a short video about a) lessons in the computer centre b) basketball and football games. ",34.0

I would like to travel only in July because this is the only month that I am on holiday each year. About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in  tents because it will be a new experience for me. I like to get new experiences specially when I am on holiday. I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports as well. I am good at swimming and playing tennis. I would like to know how much money I need to have to spend there and if I need to take with me my sports clothes. Will the Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and play tennis? If you need some more information let me know. Yours sincerely Rita Fernandez.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that's give you more opportunity to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping at least they say that . Despite the fact that it love shopping I have to agree that it is not ""always"" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's boring. You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas. Another point is  now you don't need to go out just for shopping. You can buy a lot of products by  Internet. I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it. In conclusion I think there is boring time and enjoyable time when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring time. ",28.0

In the first place, when the people think only in go to the shopping  forgot others things: play with their children, talk with than parents, friends. In the other hands, when the people go to shopping  spend a lot of money. I my view,  is more enjoyable do others things than go to shopping because, maybe ""you lose your money"". ",19.0
981," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was pleasantly surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. Firstly, I would like to answer your questions. As I am doing my A-levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August, I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent. It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins. I enjoy basketball very much and I am quite good at it. I would like to play this game at your camp. I have never tried out climbing, but I have always wished to do it one day. Would it be possible to do this activity at your camp as a beginner? Secondly, I would like to ask you for some information. Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me? Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp? Would you recommend me to bring some equipment, like a rope, sticks, with me? Thank you in advance for your help. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi, how are you? I'm actually fine at the moment, but have to study a lot because of my exams in English. You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and  make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could stay at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signature. He was fantastic, you know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you see many stars out of stage. And you might manage to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money, not a lot but enough for me. Well I'll have to close now. Give my regards to your parents.

The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch the bus number 37 which will go to  town center. From there you will walk until the college because it is easier to get there  than to get with another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from  town center. After the conference some drink and food will be available in the sport-center which is well equipped for disco-party. Our party has a special subject 'Western'. So we suggest to wear western clothes. On your last day you could go to the sport-musseum which is grateful and famous around the world or only go for a walk around Reconvillier-Park. I hope that I had answer all of your question and that the conference will be grateful. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  From: To: the group leader Subject: old Roman School.

I hope that you will get there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful thing to see. It is the unique old Roman school in the world. Location: Courtelary is situated in Switzerland and the school is on the top of the town's hill. This place is very important because it is there that an Emperor had growing up. Architecture: It is a typical  from this epoque with beautiful draw on the wall and first kind of writing in the sport center. The door is enormous because for them the entry was the most important. History: All began when Ogus Micius said that Roman need to go at school. They decided to build more school specially in Switzerland because the people  were considerated clever. During the Second World War all  school were demolished  only our is left. Conclusion: I gave you a lot of reason to get in this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town. ",25.00

I think that this programme has a good organisation, as you know, due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points. But, I was wondering, like a student of this college, if we would change part of this programme ... we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock. In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the, we can go to the show. Front my point of view, we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear, make up, hairstyles, you know ... I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and   best city to appreciate it. Please let me know if you are agree with us! Oh I forgot about it! Besides, this show is gree (another positiu point). Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE? Do you think you've  the future in your hands? Do you think we're living like  old times? Would you like living in a modern way? What do you expect about the future? Can you compare it ...? Are you afraid? Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes,  to cook to be more comfortable, for example the TV, the video recorder, etc. Maybe, in a few years later we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, from my point of view, I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes. We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer's games for example... But not in the strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars by aereoplanes... In this way, you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing  in the same way you'r changing, too. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening  our lifes. So, we have the future in our hands! Think about it. ",24.00

I apreicate it and I thank you a lot that you have chosen me as a winner. I acxepted it and I want to inform you that I can travel only on July because I have booked my anual leave  that period. Also, I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood. Every years my parents used to sent me for holidays at Camps on the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same  accommodation, and environment. Also, I prefer swimming and painting. I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old. My parents brought me to the sea side every weekend so I was used to be inside the water all the seasons. I have taken part in races twice in my life, where I was successful. Also, I like painting from  young age, and I have taken part in a public exhibition, where I won the first prize. I would like to ask how much money I should have with me, where can I keep them? What about the clothes, you don't mention anything . Do I need something special or  ordinary clothes? Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Dear Kim, I would like to write about my experience that I had, when I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my neighbourhood. I am a member in the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I assisted them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones. Unless this preparation, I also took part to the concert. I helped them to  the music and to the songs. It was a quite difficult assiment but I got  very good experience. I understood it when the concert had finished. The audients was excited and I cannot discribe my happyness. It was some thing that I didn't expect. Also, it happen  first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs. I enjoyed  very much and I want to tranfere my enjoyment to you though this letter. yours sincerely ",29.0
1238," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me for help. I hope I will be able to give you the information you need for the group of students who are coming to the conference. Firstly, the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students. The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk. Actually, the college is situated 500 meters away from the Hotel. As you know, the conference will be followed by a party. It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening. You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event. In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day, therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on. To conclude, we decided to organize a guided tour by coach, as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off. I hope the international student conference will help   to know each other better and that it will be a success. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me  information on an interesting building to visit. There is so many places of interest in Lausanne, but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons: The Olympic Museum dates from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe. It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece. You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them. You can admire every kind of equipments you need to do any particular sport. You will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowaday n high competitions. The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking. It will takes you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor,  well-known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne. I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit. Yours faithfully, ",36.00
127," DEAR SIR I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN FOR THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE. FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE. IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG! I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT THE ACTOR WAS NOT THE ONE YOU WROTE  I DISCOVERED THIS ONLY WHEN THE PLAY STARTED, AND IT WAS VERY LATE! SECONDLY, AS I WROTE BEFORE, THE PLAY STARTED LATE, AND FOR ME IT WAS TERRIBLE TO WAIT FORTY FIVE MINUTES. THIRDLY, I WAS VERY EMBARASED TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NOT DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE. FINALLY I COULDN'T EAT TOO. IN FACT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED, VERY FAR FROM MY THOUGHTS. FOR THESE REASONS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK. BECAUSE FOR ME IT WAS NOT A ""PERFECT EVENING OUT"". I AM SURE THIS LETTER WILL RECEIVE YOUR PROMPT ATTENTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU. YOURS FAITHFULLY  [SEP]  UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS. THIS WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS FOR HIM. SO MANY TIME HE WAS TOLD: ""PAT I  SAY THIS SECRET ONLY TO YOU"". PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY  FEW DAYS, AFTER  THE SECRET COME FROM THE DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID. THIS WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP: HE ALWAYS LOST HIS FRIENDS. HE WANTED TO DIE FOR THIS. THE WORST THING IS THAT HE COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS BEHAVIOUR. ONE DAY THE FORTUNE HELPED OUR POOR PAT. ON THE BUS HE SAW A ROBBER WHILE HE WAS STEALING A WALLET, HE WANTED TO SCREAM, BUT HE WAS ASTONISHED. WHEN THE ROBBER UNDERSTOOD HE COULD BE DISCOVERED  HE SAID ""IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE SECRET I WILL KILL YOU"". PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED. EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVE AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS. ",26.0
394," Dear Sir/Madam I am writting to complain about what it says in the advertisement is not true. I was really disappointed. Here are the following points, which I do not think that you have realised what you have put down. 1 The advertisement says the show starts at 19:30. Unfortunately it started at 20:15. And I think I could find something  worth to do than just writing, doing nothing during this spare time. 2 I was expected that there would be discount available for people who have student card as it says in the notice, but there was not. 3 You recommend that there will be the resturant after the show. However all I can see, the light was off and the door was locked. This is because they are rebuilding it again. 4 I have also thought in the show there was no different actor. 5 Never the less, I took my headmistress with me and I have recommened how wonderful this show was going to be. It would be greatful if you consider to return my money for the tickets back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully. Sapawadee Prisuntha.

The first thing for fashion what is called ""clothing"" or what they wear.  1st ""F"" is from ""fast-food"", something fast and easy to be spotted, which is  ancient wearing style. This is not nomally what people wear everyday.  2nd F is 'fulfill' wear ever you have under your mom's cupboard. For example long baggy troossers, which cover your bright brick shoes. Wherever you go every one would love you because of your troussers,  would clean  all the rubbish that are on the road.  3rd ""F"" could not be anything else apart from something that could make you look ""fool"".

11,"  Ms Clark, I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival. Last season I spent two days at the Festival. I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better. First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can know artists who cames from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last edition there were artists who cames from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa. Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small, and because of it I couldn't see one of the concerts in  programme. In my opinion, one of the best things of the last Festival was that there were not only concerts . I saw films and I played ping-pong. In the next edition will  be more or less ? I hope more. The thing that I liked much more than others, was that I had to buy only one ticket for all  events, and it was no pricey. It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you, I think you should do a baby-parking, in fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sons. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I like read very much, because every book that I read shows me a different world. What I try to explain is that in every book there are characters or situations  really different. So we can read realistic stories or fantastic , it depends from what we prefer. I always prefer read books that are inusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity of escape from the everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without doubts, Wuthering Heights a famous book written by Emily Brontë. The attention of the  is focused on the unfortunate love of Heatcliff and Catherine. They are the main characters of that book, and what caracterize them is the violence of their passions. In this book you can find only good or bad characters, everything is good or bad. If you look at this book like a painting you can't see afumature of colours, you see only primary colours. In other words, when I read a book I want to go in a world where I can find something different from my everyday life. ",28.00
307," Dear Mr Brown, I'm writing this letter to you to make a complain about the ""Over the rainbow"" musical show which I saw yesterday. I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because by seing your advertisment I expected more That show was entirely different to what it says on the advertisment . I arrived at the theatre at 19:30, found my seat and waited for forty-five minutes, with two hundred other people for the show to start. When it finally started I noticed that the famous actor Danny Brook was replaced by someone who was not as good as him. Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show. After some time a few of them started to leave the theatre. I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the hole show, which by the way was the worst I had ever seen. I don't know why I payed £20 with no discounts as the advertisements said it woul have. Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I wasted my time by coming here. I became furious when I saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to work  . So, I went home as fast as I could to write you this letter. I don't care what you will do about the theatre but I want my money back because this wasn't the perfect evening out you promised it would be.  [SEP]  The last forty years, technology has been growing very fast. first it was used only by the military or by scientists but  the last twenty years modern technology is found in any house, rich or poor and it helps people do hard work. Most houses have many electric devices like  microwave machine, an oven a mixer, a dish washer and many other things which can do a job by the press of a button. The last ten year computers had entered almost every house, especially in rich countrys. Competers entirely changed people lives. Children can play games on it or watch a film. There are millions of things you can do with a computer. You can listen to music and generally use it for fun but the primary reason that computer were invented was for communication. There are hundrets of prograns which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger which you wanna meet. Millions of people use computers for this reason. The general conclusion about computers is that they help people to have easier lives by doing hard work and helping them. They are important to people who like to have fun with games and they are, maybe the best way to communicate with someone you know or a person you want to meet ",28.0
384," Circle Theater To Mr. Smith, Circle Theater's manager 20th June 2000 Dear Mr Smith, By the following, I would like to inform you that I've assisted your new musical show,  which name is ""Over the rainbow"", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing  you to make a complaint on your advertisement, which I consider like a lying advertisement. Let me explain  you why I'm now so disappointed. I've spent one week holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had preparred  quiet a long time ago, this travel to the capital and spared a lot of money as well. We are both very keen on musical shows. We've already attended ""Cats"", the ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""les Miserables"", ""Grease"", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet  mentionned ""London's newest and best musical show"", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets. On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found  very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more  that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To International Post magazine Application for the shopping trip to New York Dear Sir or Madam, Please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner actually how the people are dressing to see how it's going to be developped into the future. Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday  was wearing broken-jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models,  medias, or new collection, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive that's  maybe not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex everything possible, in a way to create  own clothes. In my opinion, I think that people will wear no clothes anymore, just being natural,  nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity. I wish that my article comes in your magazine. With Best regards. ",24.0

When I arrived to  theatre and ask for the discount, it wasn't available. In your adv.  starring was Danny Brook, and on the stage  plaied different actor and his play was very poor. The whole show and  acting was an profeccion like scholl theatre. When we decided to visit  theatre Restaurant after the show it was clouse because same of decorating wasn't finish. It was  last poin  to get me angry. After evrything what happend we went to  hotel tipped and very affect. It wasn't  perfect evening out, how you did promise in your a advertisement, and I want ask for my money back.

1115," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for the programme which you have prepared for us. We really like the variety of our trip to London. The programme contains enjoyment and education, what is very esencial for young people. However, we would like to say, that recently the advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show has been seen by one of your English class student. The show will be about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. In our opinion, we should go to the show. Firstly, because we are keen on fashion. Secondaly, because we do not have to pay for the tickets. We have already orgonised our visit  new programme. The show is on tuesday and we could go to see the show in the afternoon, instead of  shopping. We think, that we may  shopping  next day, on wednesday, in our free time. We are looking foraward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  Students.  [SEP]  The Home of the Future The future is unexpectable and human beings are afriad of dangers, such as tornado or earthquake. Thinking about home like a place to live, is not already worth. We must think about home from other point of view. We need to make our home a place where we want to come back  after the work or school. It has to be  pleasure to be there for us. What we really need in the next millenium is love, that is what will keep all  family together and forever. Do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture? No; I do not think so. Live is too short to think about the poscesives. The houses will change because of new technologe, what may make our live more comfortable. Everything will be faster. We will  used to that. What depends on us, is how  atmospher we will have in our houses. The home of the Future, for me, is a place of hapinest. We cannot  aware  future technologe, but we might still have some feelings to eachothers. ",27.00
1028," Dear Mr Robertson In the name of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a galery. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. It is a famous exhibition, where are showed  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life. It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country. Could it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping time and to replace them by the London Show? We may go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of  the afternoon  free time. I hope you will consider my request. I'am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  My dream It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks. I lived in a small village on the ocean. My father was a captain on a huge boat. When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbours to harbours. I grew up through the water world and I couldn't live whitout it. Once I was fishing, when sharks came all around me. I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them. Since this famous experience, I dreamt every night about that. One Saturday I got on my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks. I had done what I had never expected to do. Now I can die in freedom. ",28.00
35," Jane Clark, The organiser, I am writting to you to give your my opinion about your festival. It was great, but I think it could be even better next year. First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries were here. So, if you can have more than six countries, it could be great. This idea is in relation with the number of plays and films. If there are more stars and artists from around the world, there are more plays and films and it is better. My second complain is about some   concert halls which are too small. It would be better if you have some  large halls, like your ""Arena"" hall. To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one reasonally price, because for someone who do not like especially art, it was very attractive. A least suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some ""salsa"" band, It would be great to listen and dance in the same time  ""salsa"" music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jimmie, I was very happy to receive a letter from you. I am writting to you to answer at your question about school rules and what I am (and I am not) allowed to do at home. Firstly in the school it is not permitted to smoking in the no smoking area or in the classroom. But, I think it is the same in England. Secondly, when you want to ask a question to the teatcher, you must to put your hand up, and speak when the teacher ask you. In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly. For example, put the music  too hight when my syster is working. But there are also some life's rules, like do not put  legs on the table when we are eating or  eat with my fingers. There are not really anything that I could like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries. It is just polite's rules. I hope I answered to your question. Big kisses, ",26.00

571," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter. I am absolutely delighted with the news. It really took me by surprise this prize, I didn't think I would be so lucky  to win. First of all, about your enquires, the only time suitable for me to travel is in July. The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, there's no further reason is just that  would be a new experience for me and I'm very excited about it. I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities during the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love sea-sports and their chalenges. Finally I'd like to ask you some questions, there are mainly  small details. I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes, if not what sort of clothes I should bring, and also how much money roughly I will need for my daily expenses. I would be very grateful for your help and advice in this matters. Thanks for the wonderful news. I'm looking forward to it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim My dear friend I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am. You must remember me telling you about the pop concert, well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it. The concert was a huge success, lots of people came and enjoyed the music. I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially when the musicians arrived, they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get. My tasks were very especifics. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and weir and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage. I really enjoyed working with those people, they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes. However, what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing, jumping and enjoying frenetically of something that I had been part of and helped to make it happened. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best Wishes ",35.0
217," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre yesterday. I had really expected the show because it was the first time I had seen it in London and I was attracted by your advertisement which looked very exciting. However, I found it very disappointing. Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes on the seat so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not  actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all. Finally, to make matters worse, your restaurant had already closed after finishing the show so I could not eat anything. You mentioned that ""Your perfect evening out!"" in your advert. but it was not absolutely true! So I must insist that I want to have a full refund. I look forward to receiving your cheque as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For many years scientific and technological break throughs have changed our lives. I think that the more technological developments we have the more comfortable lives we enjoy. Amaisingly, we can find that computer users are getting more and more. So the life is much faster and more convenient than before. My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computer or mordern technology. First of all, using  computer is the most important  for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad. I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E-mail is brilliant for my life. In addition to this, doing  internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world. Before I go on holiday I use  internet to book or get details from  travel agency, which means I could save my time and physical energy. In conclusion, in my opinion, there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say ""Enjoy your lives"". ",31.0
377," Mr. Manager, I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"", and I was very disappointed after it. First off all I would like to say that it has started later than it should to, I had to wait for about fourty-five minutes. Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much, and I think that I was not the only one who was upset. Another disappointing thing was that that discounts were not available, which made me a bit angry. Why did you write that they were available? I think that the most disappointing think was that  theatre's restaurant was closed. I would to add that I was hungry after the show.  It was not such a perfect evening out. I would rather say that it was a very disappointing evening, and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet at court! Yours sincerlly,  [SEP]  First off all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much. Every day when I get up I am checking if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS in my mobile phone. They are very usefull things which sometimes are nessecary to survive. Modern technology has got a big influence on our life. It is easier. We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones which are the best things ever made. I use them very often in my daily life. I THINK THAT TELEVISION HAS the biggest influence on our daily life. I watch about four hourers  TV a day, I even eat my meals in front of the TV. We can see PEOPLE'S LIFE in other countries which is very interesting for me and my friends. Also  Iternet has  influence on my daily life, beause I can find there many interesting things, or I can meet with people from all over the world which is exciting for me. I think that life with out modern technology would be simple and borring that's why I am using it in my daily life, I am happy that there is such  thing as modern technology. ",26.0
58," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to express my enjoyment that I had at the International Arts Festival the next week. Firstly, I want to say that this festival is really good and I hope it will have every year. Furthermore, the attractions were beautiful such as shows, exhibitions and concerts. I liked all the different kind of atmosphere. Also, for all these attractions, the price was low and it is important for the big family. Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous. However, I was disappointed by the number of that. It will be great if there were would have more choice the next year. I would like to give you a suggestion about the space in the concert rooms. Considering the crowded, it should have more rooms. Finally, I will be interested in meet artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists. In conclusion, I had an unforgetable time. I would like to eat some different kind of foods, if it is possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

In fact, at school we haven't so many rules. So, we aren't allowed to smoke inside - and eat in the classroom. We have to wash the board when it's our turn. Of course, we must respect the teacher and do what he says. What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, then I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask at my Mum or Dad for going  by my friend after the lessons. They wanted that I did my homework before  to play. Also, I had to come back at home on time, it was very important for my parents. I want to change nothing, I was happy. Anyway, it was a great time when I was a child. It's all for now.

200," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to express my disappointment about your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I saws the show's advertisement hanging up of a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends. I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good references about your Company and, above all, about the main star, Danny Brook. The problems started in the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist. Moreover, the show was delayed forty-five minutes and the worst of all was that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor. On the other hand, the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons. You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous!

101," Dear Manager of The Circle Theatre. I'M WRITING TO YOU TO EXPLAIN MY DESAGREABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE THE LAST SATURDAY, IN YOUR SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY DURING ONE MONTH. MY INTENTION WAS TO SPEND AN SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL!!! YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY. BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES  TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE. BUT WHAT CANNOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED. IT ISN'T ALL. WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER, AS YOU PUBLISHED ON THE PROGRAMM, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS!!! YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER. NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES, AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY . I FEEL YOU LIE  ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS. I WAIT  YOUR ANSWER, AND  OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Your's faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat wasn't the most popular boy in the school. He was shy, reserved and a very closed person. He enjoyed himself reading,  playing piano at home. Despite his way of live, his best friend was Anna, the most popular girl in the school. She explained everything what happened in her live to Pat. When Pat was 16, he decided to change his way of live, spending more time with friends, but what he could do to have some friends? Definately the worse. He started to ""sell"" the secrets of Anna to all the boys of the school who were interested in her. All the boys of the class went to Pat to know what Anna was doing in every moment, and Pat was becoming 'friend' of all the boys. He was very happy, because he felt that everybody loved him. Everyone, less Anna. She didn't tell him anything more, and Pat didn't have any secret to sell to his ""new friends"". At least, Pat didn't have any friend, because he didn't have anything to sell about Anna. Is it moral, to get some friends  destroying and hurting another people? I think NO! And you? ",25.0

After that, I would like to say Thanks, I never have won any price at all. Now, I will answer your requests. In reference about the date of the travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the University and I only have July to take my holidays. As  state in your letter I have to choose the accommodation type . I would prefer to stay in  tents because since I was a child I have being using this type of accommodation. I used to go to campings. About camp activities I would prefer to do basketball and photography. I have choosen these activities because actually I am playing with  university team, and photography is my favoorate hobby. I have recently bought a new camera. Finally let me know what kind of clothes will be the most suitable at camp. Is  necesarilly bring to me money in there? I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am writen to you telling  about my experience at a pop concert. It began when ours common friends Martha, ofered me  to be a organization member at the concert, obviously I accepted. Now I can tell you that it was an amaizing challange for me because I never did anything like that. My duties like a organization member were diferent, the firts day I had to pick the bands up at the airport,  for it I hired a van. The following day I was the person who provide the meals for all the organization staff and besides every day I was at the back-stage supporting the catering staff. Particularly I am pleased to had know the most popular pop stars in the world. Hopping to hear from you Best wishes ",23.0
151," Dear Sir During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show. It was a very unpleasent evening. First of all, it had read on the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring at this show. But someone else participated instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing. The second problem was the start of the show. It began at 20:15 and not at 19:30! That's almost an hour later. I had read that there would be available some discounts, but I became none of them. The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out, but it was closed because of the hour the show finished. It wasn't a perfect evening at all. I hope you can understand my disappointment and   ask for my money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  In our days, nobody can live without technology. My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The timer of my radio wakes me up at half past six. I stand up, go  the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave. After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always reach late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to make compositions, to print some pictures or to surf on the internet. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends per  telephone. Without these technology I would get realy bored. Now, I loose less of time and can use the technology to enjoy myself. ",25.0
182," 17.06.2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I have recently been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow'. To my regret, the evening totally failed to live up to my expectations. The advertisement provided false information, e.g. the names of the actors were incorrect - Danny Brook was not performing. I have to say, this fact disappointed me very much. Moreover, the show started late: instead of 19.30 ( time in the advertisement) people were allowed in at 20:15, resulting in  waiting time of 45 minutes. There were two other problems: there were no discounts contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repairement works. This evening, as you can see, proved to be far from perfect. Therefore, I would like to have my money back. Please contact me for more details if necessary. Yours faithfully, Miss Nitya Ramel  [SEP]  We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices, which would seem fantastic to our ancestors. My daily life has been changed much by modern technology without me noticing it up to this point. Just looking around, I realise that modern technology has crept into every area of my life. I would rather type some coursework up than hand-write it. This made my life easier, and at the same time saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut . When I am too tied to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with this opportunity. Using the Internet, I can meet people  all around the world not going anywhere. With all the resources on the Net I don't need to go to the library as often as I used to. I guess I haven't realised until now how much my daily life has been changed by modern technology. This leaves me wondering how beneficial its influence is for me. ",39.0
344," To the manager of the Circle Theatre. I went to see Over the rainbow Show, Friday evening the 16/6. The musical had been advertised to be London's newest and best musical, but all to my disappointment. I had been looking forward to see my favorite  Danny Brook, but he had been replaced by some other actor. I was not too happy about that and why didn't the theatre start when it was suposed to start? (45 min late), and where were the discounts which were  available? Your advertisement was ful of false advertising. In the end of the show I was looking forward to have a nice dinner in the restaurant together with my boyfriend, but it was closed, because you were short of staff. This was not my perfect evening out. I want to have at least half of my money back. I hope you preciate my letter and that you'll try to improve the disadvantages./ Sally Svenssen  [SEP]  How has modern technology Changed my daily life? The modern technology like  internet for example has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways. The advantages with  internet are that I can do all my shopping from  internet. I don't have to stress around in the supermarket  a friday evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the groseries I need delivered to my door. Instead. I buy all my clothes on  internet as well and it works brilliant, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with  internet too. I don't get as much exercise as I used to get. Nowdays I spend 2 hours intent of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people. I have got friends over the whole world now. I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my internetfriends. The modern technology open new and exciting ways for us. I don't think that I had been going to Japan if it wasn't because of  internet. Internet has opened  a whole new world to me.

1107," Dear Mr Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London. Especially the sightseeing by bus seems to be very interesting. But we would like to suggest you something: There is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear; make up and hairstyles on the 14th of March. It is called ,,The London Fashion and Leisure Show."" This would be a great opportunity   because we are all intrested in clothes, sports and fashion. I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students! Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum. The show lasts nine hours, from 10.00-19.00, the whole day! Our question now : Could we go to this show? We could maybe change Tuesday's programme to Wednesday. We all prefer   the show, free time is not so important for us. Please think about this and give us an answer. Thanks. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Jack Thanks a lot for your letter. I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams. Therefore I read Agatha Christie's ,,Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". I can really recommend you this book, it is fabulous. It is also a suitable present for your cousin, I think. One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island. There is a storm and they can not leave. Suddenly a murderer happens! Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery. But I will not tell you  more. You have to read it yourself. And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book! Unfortunately it is quite expensive, £32. But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it! Okay, I hope to have news from you very soon. Have a good time. Yours sincerely, ",37.00
601," 13 June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan: I am very glad I won the Competition to go to Camp California. I must say though, I would have to travel on July because it's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friend if it is possible. Log cabines will be  ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at . Climbing would be my second option,  for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times. I would like to know how much money do people ussually take and how many clothes. Sincerely Yours  [SEP]  13 July Dear Kim: Well, you want to know what I did in the concert? Help.. I know it sound extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprise it turned out to be much more fun that expected. About 20 people were helping apart from me, we had some kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert. Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert. It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs! It was so fun, that I enjoyed it a lot. If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me, I'm in!!! Write back soon ",36.0
903," Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I would like to travel only in July because at that time I am going to be free to travel because of my holidays in the school. I would rather to stay in  tents, because I have stayed in tents before and I liked , it is more pleasent than stay in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience. Refering about sports I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions. About basketball, I would say I like it to play as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool, I was not as good  as in swimming but I like it. I think I do not have anything to ask you, I just want to thank you for everything. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I agree that shopping is not always ejoyable because a lot of things could occur  you. I remember when I was younger I used to go with my mom shopping to the stores but I did not like it, because I found  boring to buy clothes spending a lot of hours in a commercial centre. Another bad thing could be the enormous queues in the supermarkets, it is incredible how many time you can spend in there. The last month  was a robbery in a commercial centre next to my house, somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identifications, credit cards and cash, even more her flight ticket. Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancell their credit cards and to change her flight ticket. Unlucky lady. To sum up I would say that even when shopping is not always enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option. ",26.0

I'd like to tell you that the best month  to travel to the U.S.A is on july because I will be on hollidays in this month. I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can tell you wich one I prefer I'll choose  in  tent. This is because  is more exciting and fun than not in log cabins. From the list of activities to do at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming. I used to go to a swimming pool twice every week and also I love music and sing all the time. I'd like to ask you about how much money I'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next july. I am looking  to hear  you very soon.

It was great, believe me! I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy, a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the Club and we put it on the stage. After this, we helped to the service bar to put into the fridges all  drinks and refreshments. And that was it! I enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marevellous! Well Kim, I hope to see you soon and take care. Love ",29.0
1197," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received yesterday. Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations, which might be useful for the students. First of all, the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel, which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities. This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall. You will be able to get there either by bus (no 150) or on foot. Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference. It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last the whole night. People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi-coloured clothes. Finally I think that you should jump at  opportunity to go to the historical Pergam's Museum before leaving. Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there. I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth. Your sincerely  [SEP]  To: (group leader) From: Subject: Bournemouth National Museum As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum, which is, to my mind, one of the most interesting buildings of the area. Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need. 1. Architecture The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit 'heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world. 2. Exposition Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum. 3. Restaurant The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum. To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant  to have a rest if you need to.

482," June 17, 2000 Dear Manager, As for the ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems. Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned on the advertisement for this musical show as ""Danny Brook"". As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny's stage, I was very disappointed. I think you should have informed us of  changing  starring before starting of the show. In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was changed. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30  mentioned on the advertisement. As the third point, our tickets were not discounted at all! The Ad. says that TICKETS: Discounts Available. Lastly, your theatre restaurant had been closed already when the show was finished, because the time of begining of the show was late. As above mentioned, it can not be a ""perfect evening"". There are lots of reasons why I was so disappointed, and could not enjoy the show, you see!! Therefore,  would be grateful if you could give me back some money.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told about our plan, indeed our ""secret plan"", to Sally! How foolish! But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday-party for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been ""surprising"". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents already died when she was in the high-school. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children. In spite of such difficulties, she always shows a pretty charming smile to us. On June 2, because of Pat's fault, Sally already knew our plan. We were enjoying  at  home celebrating her birthday. Suddenly, the door was opened. ""Good Evening!"" ""Oh! You came back for me! Nigel"" Sally cried with pleasure. Nigel himself was a big ""surprising"" present for Sally. I never forget her happy face ..... We spent a brilliant night. ",25.0
468," Dear Madam/Sir, I am writing to say I am not satisfied with your musical show. Recently I am interested in musical shows, because I have never seen it in my country. When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive for me. So I went to London to see the show. As I arrived there after 5 P.M., I missed the first performance, so I decided to see the 19:30 p.m performance. However it started  20:15! Furthermore there were no student discounts! The worst one was that the actor and actress were not the person who had been written  in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed. So, I could not concentrate on the show. After the show, when I went to the restaurant it was closed, because it usually opens between afternoon and evening shows. It was a really disappointing evening! So I am asking for some money back. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully Chu Jin-Sun.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? It could be difficult to feel how many things has been changed in our daily life. But if you thought   10 years before you can easily notice. I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view, In an advantage. The modern technology is developing toward convenience for human. So, we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using  internet. How incredable it is! However  not only this advantage but also there are lots of disadvantages. Although  mobile phone is very useful  our life, it might be harmful for our brain because of micro wave it can cause the cancer or traffic accidents. In addition the side effect of artificial farm products also can't be ignored in our daily life. So I would like to say  the science and techology changed our daily life  more convenience  it also could be dangerous. ",26.0

I'm happy to read that I will have the chance to do two activities there. I chose painting and photography. I like painting and I have talent, I could paint all the day. Photography is a relaxing activity. You can photograph all kind of arts you want. I take very good photos! I would ask you about clothes and money. What kind of clothes should I bring with me?

I will be busy to decide everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there. I would prefer  in tents as a accommodation because it sounds thrilling and even ecstatic for me and also I have never tried this kind of accommodation before. I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis. To produce a film is very hard work. I must keep  a good condition to make a masterpiece. Swimming is really nice for my relaxing and I can do exercise for a long time. On the other hand, tennis stimulates my body and soul. It is good for my inspiration.

699," Dear Mr Ryan I have just received your letter and I am really delighted and thrilled to win the first prize in your competition. For the trip to California, I can only go in July, I am afraid, because my English course finishes in June and it starts again in August. In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or  log cabin, and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please. Because last time I was in a tent, I found it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I couldn't got to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent. I would like to take part in surfing and swimming please. Although I have never done surfing before, I am a quite advanced swimmer. Finally I would like to ask some questions. What is the weather like over there and what should I wear? How much money would I need? How big is the camp? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Shopping can be very exciting and fun. The feeling of buying new things is wonderful. But it might not be the same everytime. We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying things neccessary is fine I think. But buying things that  do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But after you never eat them and just bin them. I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you don't need or unplanned, might make you feel sad after sometime. ",37.0

I will give you the information which you asked me  in your letter and also  will ask you some questions. As I understand  is very imortant to confirm the date of  travelling. I would rather choose July because it is  only one month when I have got holiday, long enough to spend it by travelling abroad. Now about accomodation. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in  tent. As I am young I would like to be a romantic person and to be closer to the nature. I think it will be the best way to understand what California means. Ansering to your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming. I am quite good in tennis, especially plaing in two pairs. Also I like swimming and I've got two year experience in teaching swimming in  lesure centre. Could I ask you some questions about clothes and money. Should I take some clothes for  cold weather? The last question - could you tell me some idea about how much money could I need. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. As a women, as a mother and, finally, as an ordinary person, I am doing shopping quite often. Do I enjoy it? If I told you ""yes"" or ""no"", I'd tell you nothing. Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't be concentrate in a shop, but I can't relaxe as well. I am looking on the shelfs but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list. Everybody are pushing me and I think that I came in a wrong place. On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really nesseceraly. I also understand that nobody will do that at my place. However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me  something special and testy. To be honest, sometimes I like shopping. I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kind of food could be in fashing. When I am with my children I can lean them reading, counting, if they only don't run away from me to educate themself in the huge world,  which name is ""shopping"". ",28.0

It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The students can get there with the No 35 bus. They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station. The hotel is opposite the station.

Someone can get to the city centre with the No.456 bus and then  on foot to the castle. Service: It is over 100 years old but it is kept in a good condition by the local people, who are proude of this castle. Activities: At this time of the year, you will visit Nyremberg, on the castle are taken place many theatrical plays or concerts. View: From the castle you can have a wonderful view of all the town, especially at night when all the lights are on. It is a different expirience. History: At the castle  are always  few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthousistic. RECOMMENDATION I recomment to visit this castle, because it is interesting, marvelous and something different. It is the favourite place of all the tourists who visit Nyremberg. Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different expirience and a lesson too. By the way you can visit the ",24.00
458," Dear Sir, I've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical, starting from the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets. There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30. And I am asking you: Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience? I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back, please I hope you will reply to my letter. Regards XX  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life. We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages. The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature. And  not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone. In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology  is a benefit for you. If you don't  is going to destroy you. ",33.0
289," Dear manager I went to the theatre to see a musical show ""Over the rainbow"" and had a very disappointing evening. According to your advertisement, the actor should be Danny Brook, but infact it was  different person. My ticket was for 19.30, but it started very late, it started  20:15. When the show finished, it was too late to catch the train to home. I had to take  taxi. It costed me £30. ""What a waste!,, By the way, I didn't see any discounts for buying tickets. One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I get there for a glass of drink, I don't know why, there was no written notes or information about that. I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out. Would you consider to give  my money back? If the refund is available, it would be grateful. I would look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is one of my colleges in the office. She works with me. We get on very well. She is a single mum. She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understandable. Last week, I missed work on Tuesday, so Pat had to work harder because she was all alone. I appreciated her and she wouldn't mind. I told her the reason that I had to miss the work. My son was in prison. I had to go and see him. I still don't know how it really happens to him. All I know is  about drug smuggling,  that he  involved. I asked to her not to tell anyone, because I didn't want others know about this. I am  very private person. Yesterday morning, I went to  toilet, I overherd two people talking about my son I felt pity on myself and I burst into tears. I quickly got out of  toilet. I don't remember how I finished work that day. Nowadays, it is hard to trust people. No one is perfect. Everybody make mistakes. I decided to forgive my friend Pat. ",28.0
335," Dear Sir/Madam My name is Alida Fanetti, and I'm writing  you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently. One evening, while I was walking around the city I saw a very interesting advertisement, which was about a musical show. I'm a fun of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the show. The tickets were a little expensive but I was with other TEN people, so when we read ""Discounts Available"" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for group of numerous people. It wasn't true; there weren't any discounts. The show started at 20.15 and not at 19.30 so we waiting for  long time. Before the show started, a man said that there wasn't Danny Brook because he was ill. It was a disaster. After the show, which wasn't as good as we expected, we decided to go to the theatre restaurant. It was closed because people in the kitchen weren't ready with the food. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and I, would be gratefull if you will give us some money back, if it is possible. I hope to receive an answer. Your faightfully  [SEP]  ""the old man and the sea"" BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY Dear Sandro, I'm Alida, how are you? I'm writing  you because I have an important thing to tell you. I read in the newspaper that in the next  days some book of short stories are going to be read on the radio. A few days ago you told me that you have to read ""the old man and the sea"" by Hemingway for school; well, on friday  is going to be read, on the frequency 96.7, this book. I suggest you to listen to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading for you. I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's a possibility for ""busy people"" to know important and beautiful short stories and books. Well, I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book. I read it two months ago and I liked it very much. It's a sad story but it makes you know  a tipe of life that you can't imagine that really exists. The old man is a sad person but he loves his live and lives on the beach because he can't stay without see the sea for a day. I think you will enjoy it. Now I have to stop writing but I'll write you more letters. I hope you will listen to this book on the radio. Write me back soon and tell me about your impression   (I mean if you enjoyed the story or not!) Love P.S. Remember 96.7 on friday at 15.30 p.m. ",25.0
555," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize. First of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something. The only time that  is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday. For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece. The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say, that I am quite good in climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my live, so that is an activity I have to learn. Last but not least there are some things I would like to know: What kind of wheather do you have in California? Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me? And what about money? How much money Should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many persons are going to stay in each tent. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Many people, especially women, love shopping. If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat. But shopping is not always enjoyable. First of all because of the big variety in the store. Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila. And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want. Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded. Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people. And many people are in a hurry, so don't wonder if other people have not  tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars. Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause, which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine . That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about. ",33.0
702," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and feel happy about winning first prize. I am now writing to give you all  information you require. First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June. On August I am going to apply for a new job. Also, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than stay in a tent. From my point of view, log cabins are more comfortable. Another consideration are  activities. I enjoy playing basketball and golf. Also I think I am good at singing and at dancing. I would be most greatful if you could let me know some information: - How  to get to Camp California from  airport? - How far from  city-centre the camp is situated? - How much money  I have to take with me? - What is the weather in California in July? - What kind of clothes would you recommend me to bring with me? - Are there leisure and intertainments facilities close to the camp? I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Report To: Mr Clark From: Sonya Volavkova Attituds to the video about life at our school Introduction:- The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's attituds about  video they have to be made and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. The report is based on  opinion of more than 300 pupils. What would the pupils prefer to film? According to the answer there are the most important activities pupils would like to film (80 per cent of those questioned ) - lessons in Mathematics and History, because pupils have very good exam's result. - lessons in dancing, because 80 per cent  girls attend the Dancing Club -  competition in basketball, because our school's team won first prize in our gerian. -  pupils' travel to London, during the last holiday, because it was great! - Also they would like to film the pat corner at school, because they enjoy taking care of animals. Conclusion: It is clear, that the filming of  video is  very important event for  children, and pupils would prefer to film only  positive events of their life at school as I have written above.

582," . I would like to travel only  July because I would be in schools holydays  and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip which is boring?! And when the sun is shining you are relax and you feel good. . I would prefer  tents to sleep  at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents  to compare   in a house. You are in communication with the nature and you can hear the insects. And we only need to sleep and not to cook or watch T.V... It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable. . From the list below, the two activities I will choose are Tennis and sailing. Tennis because I play Tennis and I am classed 15-5. I like very much Tennis because it is a technical and physical sport. And you need  strategie to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside in the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind,  the ball becomes incontrolable!  Windsurfing because I pratise it for a long time. You can do it alone. I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and slide like skiing, surfing. you need technics to move the windsurf. You must know how to use the wind and you have great sensations! I would like to ask you questions: Must I take with me my clothes? Is there a washing machine at Camp California? Do I need some money to pay  the meals!  [SEP]  you have recently had a class discussion about shopping. Now your english teacher has asked you to write a composition, giving your opinions on : ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" In fact, shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you don't have enough money! You don't find anything interesting in the shop. You can hesitate  to choose an article. Which is the best article to take? The seller can be not very nice and watch you all the time. You don't find your size or the good color in the article. The article can be too expensive. It looks fragil and it could break easily. Your must test several shops and compare the price, the quality of the articles. So you must walk all the day or go by car. And the weather must be fine if you walk in the town. Shopping is not always enjoyable if there is a lot of people in the shops because you can't move and choose the article and be cool! ",28.0
868," Dear Madam, I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition and want to thank you for that very interesting competition. I am only available in July because I am studying in an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July! You asked me which  accommodation I would prefer between  tent and  log cabin. I am used to spend summer holiday in  tent and I like it, but why not try  log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could practice tennis and surfing. In fact, I soon practice tennis and I am quiet good at , and it will  the occasion to train myself surfing is completely unknown for me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not! Finally, I wanted to know if I need  money and how many, and if there is a dry cleaning. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Anis LACOSTE  [SEP]  We know all what shopping is. Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable. When you got to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but there is no more of it. You think that shopping is not enjoyable at all. Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there is too much people. You don't like shopping but you must go shopping to eat! But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time (the girls know what it is). finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of  time it isn't enjoyable! To conclude, if you don't want to go to the supermarket to spend four hours there, send your girlfriend and it will be more enjoyable! ",33.0
73," Dear Ms Clark, I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich is a great idea. I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. As I saw on the advertisement, there were stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries . It would be better if there were more than six countries. I noticed that some concert halls were too small. I wonder if you could offer outside concerts. Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films. Don't you think you could create dramatic courses? Visitors could learn plays with professionals. Finally, the idea of a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we pay only once and we can see all the events. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter which I've just received. You ask me to tell you about school rules and what we are allowed to do at home in France. I don't think the rules are so different between England and France but I'm going to try to give you examples. Firstly, at school,  we missed a course, we must bring a medical attestation. Furthermore, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE. At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss  with our family. There are so many rules but it would be too long if I had to explain all of them. l'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, ",31.00
388," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre. According to the advertisement, one of the actor who had to show was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another disappointing actor instead of him. By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it had to start at 19:30: it wasn't in late, it was to much in late. We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for. And what's more, there weren't  discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff. Well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I pretend to have my money back, I waisted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programm I payed for. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Your sincerely  [SEP]  Science and technology have changed man's life: that's true, I don't need to look  how they affect the lives of the others, I have only to see how they have changed my life. Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that  borns from the technology. Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something  intersts you. But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed: in my mind all must be in order like in a CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of  mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take part of my life. In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in order to meet new people, to speak with them  to have a contact with the ""human world"". Am I crazy? No, I'm only a daughter of the technology. Yesterday my grandmother asked me what will I do without the computer. I answered to her saying I probably will die. ",31.0
1215," 12, June, 2001 Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter about the international student conference. Here are  answers for your questions. You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated in front of the railway station, Camberley. To get  the conference, you catch the coach No.7 from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop. It takes 5 minutes from the station. When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held. The end-of-conference party will be held at the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium. It starts at 18 p.m. and ends at 22 pm. We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign country will prepare their ethnic foods. There is a museum next to the Camberley Station, which has  good collection of paintings and potteries, and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time. Instead, there are a lot of shops around there, you can buy souvenirs. I am looking forward to meeting you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: Student from the United States From: Juli The aim of this report is to describe the Haunted Castle in Camberley. Place This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods. Inside of the castle is always dark even in  daytime. Story It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost. She appears occationaly and opens every window in the castle. It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window. People said she was seeking something and  still seeking  even if she had dead for 500 years. Conclusion The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture of  16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is worth while to see . I hope you'll enjoy visiting there.

417," Dear Mr Smith, Last week I and my family had a holiday in London. At the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre. I insisted on going to your theatre, to the Circle Theatre, because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London. That days you presented ,,The over the Rainbow"". how you have written at the advertisement: it is the London's newest and best musical show. But I and my family had a very disappointing evening. Because, at first, at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it wasn't so. Danny Brook didn't play at the performance, there was another unknown actor. And he played awful, I couldn't hear him. Then at the adverstisement stood that  performance begin at 19.30. I and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15, because the show started only at that time. I was very nervious. What is more you wrote that discounts  available, but it was also  lie. After the show I was very disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure. He suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant. But when we came to it, we saw that the restaurant was closed, because it was  reconstructed. But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement, if it is closed? So this evening was terriable. It broke all my impression about London. And now I requere my money back. Because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement I didn't get.  [SEP]  There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appear not long ago. Among them a mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different mashiens for  kitchen, mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they very simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time at the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing up dishes. They can only push on their dish mashiens and go to do something what they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in  daily life of people. Some years ago people especially students had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something. But now they can use  Internet, where you can find any information you need. Very often I use  Internet, and I must say it is very convienient. The another  modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone. If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, of if something terriable has happened with me, I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box. I just use my mobile phone. Finally, I can say that modern technologies very help people at their works. With them people do their work more quikly and successfully. ",26.0
1103," Dear Mr. Robertson, As you are probably aware of our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have made us a very nice schedule. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but due to the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class asked me to propose a change in our schedule. This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases on sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would be having fun, meeting the locals and practising our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school. The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show. Our free time on Wednesday could be spent in the Museum. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Sarah, I'm sorry it took me so long to write you back, but I have being very busy lately: Anyway, on your last letter you asked me whether. Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie would be or not a good present for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea! You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones  you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Specially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published. Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holidays. My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go into College. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time! I think that's all about it. Write soon.

1223," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning. Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are comeing now. You asked me which hotel the group had been booked . It is the Palace hotel, about a mile away  where the conference will take place. The best way to get there, is to take the bus number 7. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will leave the bus at ,,Royal gardens"". Turn left and go straight to ,,Baker street"" At the need of this street there is the house number 18. This is our college. You wish to know all about ,,the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us by their songs. Moreover you asked what to wear. Do not bother. I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes, like a jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket. Donnot forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have  chance to change it. Finally I give you some advise for what you could do for about three hours. Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum, it is located near the hotel. Furthemore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located to walk within five minutes. Lastly there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows. For further information please call me up. I hope you will have an interesting conference here. I am looking forward  seeing you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The telephone a very important invention In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived. It has been in her parents' appartement. The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls. Todays nobody could imagine such a situation. In every household there is a telephone at least. There are a lot of advantages for it. Firstly people are able to talk to  person on every time. Be it: just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins. Moreover we always can call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor. This could save  life! An other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it. Of course there is also a big disadvantage. All people know this situation; people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone. Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time. Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention. To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things. It is always the same  how to people use it or not and how people handle it. ",23.00
1109," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you about the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially  the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an advertisment for ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go and see it. First of all, you might not know what this show is . In fact, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be interesting for us to see all that ""live"", rather than on TV. Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget. The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the Science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move  to the show. It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while. We all hope you will be able to find a good solution without causing too much trouble. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Terror in the Alps It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. We had been trapped in the snowy, almost vertical slopes of the ""Tête Blanche"" for more than ten hours by then. We were there, alone, my friend with his broken leg and myself. We had decided to climb that more than 3'700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped! I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which we were able to call a helicopter. We were safe! ",38.00
528," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given. Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him. Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show. It began 45 minutes later than it should have been. Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket, it occuried to be impossible to have one. Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff. All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, T. Gens  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone. It was far too heavy to keep it for myself. So I made a mistake and I told her. The day after, at school, I noticed that everyone was looking at me. I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat. She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes. From this moment, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know  it sooner or later. It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse. I tried to take it on my stride but I couldn't. I was terrified. My fear turned out to be right. I read the hurt in her eyes. She knew. She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it. ",38.0
177," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complain about your theatre and the musical show ,,Over the rainbow"". Firstly, in your advertisement  was said that Danny Brook has a part in the show, but there was a different actor in the play. This fact disappointed me a lot. Secondly, there was written in the advertisement, that the show begins at 19.30, however, it started at 20.15. According to the advertisement, discounts should be available, but, in fact, I was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way. It was very uncamfortable for me. In addition to this, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late (the show did not start on time). Everybody, who came to it's doors, had to go to the other restaurant in  bad mood. I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting. Furthermore, I would like you to return my money. You promised me  perfect evening out, but it was one of the most terrible in my life. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was  25-years-old secretary in one big company. Her boss was  rich man, really rich. His name was Timson White. He was one of the most famous person in his city, but he wasn't honest with his clients. Pat had worked for him for two years. Certainly she knew a lot of secrets. One of them was about her boss' private life: he had got  illegal son. Timson's wife, who was good looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He even couldn't say a word. He tried to make up who could give his wife knows. Of course, only one person had known this except his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check it up. Next day he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed  new secretary. It was the worst weekends in a last few years. On the other hand, now everything is o.k. Timson has a good close family, his son lives with them, his company makes a good profit... Only Pat has problems, she should earn her living in other company again! ",26.0
725," Dear Ms Ryan I am very astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I will say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California already. I have never been in California yet. Now I will give you the further information: I have to travel in July because I had to make sure that I can have  holiday this year and it is the only possebility! I am sure you can take attention on this. I decided to have the accommodation at Camp California  in a tent, because there you will have lots of fun. You can feel the fresh air and listen to  animals, this will be a great oportunety! I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am not well in both activities, but it will be a pleasure to try it espacially surfing, I would like to feel the air in my hair, and enjoy how quick the board goes over the sea. Another question I have; the live there, is it as expensive as I think? And the weather are they only sunshiny days? In the other hand it is not as important, the main reason is I really look forward to go at this Camp and one more time, thanks a lot! Yours sincerely L. Schwartz  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement, we have had a great  argueing. Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home, to wear, but mostly you will have allways not enough. When I decided to go for a shopping, first I will make sure that I have enough time. I am not a typical women because I hate shopping! I am lucky if I will find something which fits. The main reason I hate , there are too many people who are always standing in my way (or maybe I think in that way) and I begin to be angry, normally I am looking those people with evil eyes! I mean, it is too crowdy, you have to wait such a long time before you can pay, and mostly all the things are too expensive! Even before you will find a color you like or the right size of the trousers, you were looking for it a long time, has gone! Lastly, you can see, my opinion about shopping is not very good, then I think shopping is never enjoyable! ",28.0
963," Dear Sir/Madam Thank you for your lovely letter? I was really surprise to heared I have won in your competition. With pleasure I'll give all  information wich you need. I would like to book my tickets from the beginning of July. The 3rd of July will suit to me. As far as I know accomodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I prefer log cabins. It's more convinient for me. I am very glad I can chose two activities while I will at the Camp. I am keen on basketball, I played in my country for 7 years. I am  good diffender. I would like to choose surfing like my second activities. I've never done it before. I'd like to get some lessons if it's possible. I've seen how people do it but I've never tried it my own. I'd like to know what temperature  in July in California and youre advice about how much money I will need to have an unforgetable hollydays! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable, is it? We can't say that  is always enjoyable or  is not. Every new day is not the same. But... I think that good shopping depends on ourself. If we decided to by somthing special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it. Probably, maybe not. Some times we have to have deal with not good service or for example could you imagine it on your way to  shop you have met wrong people or someone told you bad news. Or  quality of your new thing is not so good that you really expected. Situations are variously. Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to  night-club but you are short of money. Some people will do crazy things in  situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party. But I want to wish you have a good enjoyable shopping all your way. ",25.0

I would like to go travel in July, because at that moment, is stay my summer holiday, so I had more freedom time, and I want to live in tents more than log cabin, because when we live in a tent, usually we are in the countryside. at that moment, I think it should be suitable for me. Do you know, I am amuzing  to play tennis? I am  tennis first team in my school, so I can show my highly tennis skill during the holidays, and I can play Basketball as well, but not very good, you can say I only know how to play.

When you go to shopping with your girl friend, she want to watch every  clothes in the shopping centre, but you are not interesting of that, romatic, no! I think you will feel boring. If you interesting of the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, they should had diffence fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so at the last you both two will feel unhappy or angry to each other. If you go out with your same sex friend that should be fine, same fashion, but  everytime  go to the same place, everyone will feel boring.

89," Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was an other actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to , the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed for all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there wasn't any discount! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I hadn't a great fun, so I ask for  money back. Your faithfully  [SEP]  In fact, some days before Karin, a friend of hers, had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John, her science's teacher. Pat was astonished, and didn't know what (she) had to tell Karla. The teacher was 40 years old, and Karla was only 16 (years old). This age's difference was too big! Besides, Karla was a shy, polite girl that Pat wanted to help. So she decided to tell Hill all the story. Hill like Pat very much, but only as a friend. He was 19 (years old), so Pat thought, that he had to know what was the best thing to do. But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousine.

Thank you for  chance to do two activities. I would like to choose Tennis and Photography. I play tennis since I was ten years of age. In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed.

For example: Maraya Kary, Tom Jone; Madonna. I saw the ""Boys on"". I knew you love them and I took two autographs for you and of course for myself. Afterwards ""Boys on"" won the first prize.

303," Dear Mister Muller, I address this letter to you because as the manager of ""The Circle Theatre"" I hold you responsible for the most disappointing evening in a theatre I had in years. I went to see the evening performance of your production of ""Over the Rainbow"" on saturday the 2nd of June. At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable. I bought one of the most expensive tickets. Although the show was scheduled to start at 19.30h, it did not begin until 20.15h. To my greatest disappointement Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement. After the show I had to find out that the theatre restaurant, that had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party. Contrary to your advertisement I had no ""perfect evening out"" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket. faithfully yours ....  [SEP]  Best detective stories of Agatha Christie That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie's ""Witness for the prosecution"". This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who inherited her whole fortune to him. He had befriended her without telling her that he was married. The accused is defended by a famous lawyer who tells his wife that a loving wife's confirmation of her husband's alibi will not convince the jury To help her husband she works out a plan: She is willing to be  witness for the prosecution and states that her husband has not been with her at the time the crime was committed. She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations. The plan works: The jury thinks that the wife is a notorious liar and her husband is found innocent. After the trial the lawyer is told that the man was indeed guilty. ",36.0
333," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement of The Circle theater said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there. First of all, the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I don't have the chance to enjoy his excellent performance. Another actor standed  for him, without any advice. Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show which it started forty-five minutes later without any factual reason . In addition to all this, there was no discount in the price of the tickets, for students either, contrary to what I was told by  phone when I asked for more information. Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater's restaurant. But for our surprise, it was out of order. At the end of all these circumstances we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint. So, due to the things I have mentioned, I think I shoul be given some money back. I look forward to recieving  information from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" Owing to the great speed of technological development, people need to lead a faster life. When this technological aspect changes so quickly, I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields. I would say that the worst thing of this development for me is that more and more I experience stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is no enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life passes devoted in my duties without  time to pleasures. Apart from this, another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities, being able to breath fresh air several days a month when we go to the country. In addition to this, there is less comunication between members of my family, because when we arrive at home after an exhausted day racing with the time, the only thing we want to do is lying in the sofa while watching television. Apart from this, computer's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to, while five years ago when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people. On the other hand and as a conclusion, I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions. ",31.0
970," Dear Competition Organiser, I am writing to replay  your letter and to ask  more details about the competition. Firstly, I would like to say that I'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition. As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays on July. Is it suitable for you? As you mentioned about the accomodation, I would prefer stay in the tents, because it's more exciting and I really love camping. I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good in almost  of this activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it's misteries and I also like the watter, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I'm tall and very fast with the ball. Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed  to pay for food and things like that. I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay. sincerely Clara  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to tell you some news and to ask a little bit about you. First of all, I'm going to tell the good news. Last month, I went to a pop concert with four bands . It was unbelivebly!!! Although it was 5.000 thousand people there, people could walk and dance without any problem. It was very well organised, the shows started in the exactly  time and the group were well performed too. I have contributed to the concert  selling some tickets to my friends. However  the success of the concert, at the end of  show some full gays started a big confusion and some people get hurt. It was depressing... Finally, I would like to know some news about you, What have you done? Be you studing a lot? Please write me a letter as soon as possible! Love from Clara. ",28.0

Secondly, there are some  programme that are very great. First time, the conference's head make a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks.

129," Dear Sir, I am writing to complete about my being to the Circle Theatre during my last week's holiday in London. I have seen a musical show and it was not my favourite time. I am confusing because of playing different actor in place  Danny Brook. Secendly, the show started at 20.15. This is why I was feeling invited to your restaurant after  show. Unfortunately, I found closed doors and any information about the reason. I would like to add that being a student I find discounts very important for my budget. Neither without any reason  it was not available. I will  gladfull if you will send my money back. Your faithfull,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason whe we were  horrible troubles with  police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk with us. Let's  back to the beginig of this story. I with my friends had  holidays and decided to spend a few days on a ""island"". We called this place like this, because it was a  land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning on a land - to our town. There was no light during nights so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was a walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered a gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place when  robber keept stolen gold from  bank. We found the solution of this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but... I think you are able to imagine what was happen later. ",21.0
653," I feel very happy to be the winner of your competition. I would like to travel in July only because they will need me at work in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I have never done it and I think it is an experience not to be missed, a very original adventure! I would like to do singing and swimming. For the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very few experience in it. Concerning swimming, I practise this sport once a week on myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer! Otherwise, I would like to ask you which clothes I will have to take in my luggage. What is the weather like in July? Is it worth to take a raincoat? Should I take trainers? Finally, how much money must I bring with me? Is it necessary to ask for Travellers' Cheques? Or is it better to take only an international credit card?  [SEP]  Going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what  to do but it has also many disavantages. First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are on week-end. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want. Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had to find a  cloth for a precise day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it. However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what  to do. You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant to try  many  clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny! Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible. For instance, if you try  a cloth which fits you well, it can contribute to make you feel better.

1050," 12.12.0 Dear Mr Robertson; I am writing in reference to the programme for the English class, that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I agree with that, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to  River trip to Greenwich, Also, they can visit  Science Museum, and they can going to the shopping, on Wednesday 15 March they  going to visit The National Art Gallery, really, I think that is  good programme. However, I think as well, that the class would like to visit ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"",  is on Tuesday from 10.00 AM until 19.00 pm. They don't need to pay. In addition, I think  is a good a idea, because they could go after shopping, when they have a free time, I am sure about that, they will like to visit that place. However, the programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody. Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand  accept you personal opinion as well. I look forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  12.12.00 My personal opinion about famous people, is  good in one way and bad in another way. I think that they live their life like hat, because they want to live this life. They doing everything just for money,  sometimes, they can make theirs life easier than they  normally do. It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalist following them all the time, however this news give them money, and  confortable life. Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, they live happy, because they know that the famous mean to be rich. They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be a very good peaple, because ""the Famous"" is just for a few time, nothing is forever in this world. My personal opinion is that, I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well. I do not really like will be a famous person, because you are not really yourselfh, and for me  is the more important thing. Your faithfully ",23.00

First of all I would like to travel in July because I already made an arrangement with my boss about my free days. I would prefer to sleep in an log cabin. I am not just to sleeping in an tent and I think it mabey ruen my holiday. I hope it's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it's not, you can also put me in an tent.

So I am not very good in Photography. Surfing is my passion. I live nearby a beach and whenever I have the time I grape my bord and go surfing. I would like to have a surfing contest with other surfing nerds, if it's possible. I would like to know if I have to bring my own wetsuit for surfing and how much money do you think I need?

I'm doing great esspecially after my experience with helping at  pop concert. It was fantastic. You also would have liked  very much. I had to help back stages. I had to take care of that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone elses. Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted. The realy thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost. That was a good feeling for me. I had to tell them when they had to go on stages. What kind of clothes they shoot wear. I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous. The thing I realy liked, was helping the artists and talking to them. Oke, they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert. Afterwards they talk to me and thanking me for helping them in those exciting moments. I realy got to know them after the concert. They also took me to a after hour party and they asked me if  would like to do this again. And of course I immediately said Yes!!

They are heaven! I can spend in there all day. In fact, they have many kind of products which make me happy. To be honest, I don't always buy these products but I can be satisfied with just looking  them. Some people doesn't like to go shopping with a friend who takes  long time to decide. Even in this case, shopping is fun for me. I believe there are  lot of why to enjoy shopping. By the way, shopping is a sort of therapy. I sometimes go shopping when I have stress. Shopping helps me to cheer up every time. I think many people, specially women, had  same experience. But the most important things to enjoy shopping is not to use every  money which you have. ",29.0
645," Dear Madam, I am very happy to hear that I've won first prize in your competition. Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for. I would like to travel in July. I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best. As for accomodation I would prefer log cabins, because I belive they are more comfortable then tents. The activities I would like to do during my stay are golf and surfing. I never tried those sports, because they are quite expensive. I have two questions. Could you tell me what are the weather conditions in California at that time of year, because I want to know what clothes to take. Am I supposed to take an outfit for sports as well? The other question is about money. Will I be given any pocket-money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences? Yours sincerely Adalbert Turnau  [SEP]  First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is  great idea. Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there. I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic. To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film. Below are my suggestions of what should be filmed. The first thing to be filmed is our English lesson, because our teacher Mr. S. has a lot of weird ideas and we could get a lot of fun moments on tape. The chemistry lesson should be filmed because we do a lot of interesting experiments there. The computer class can be also there, because program and internet surfing is quite interesting. As for other activities, there is a Jiu-Jitsu class after regular lessons. Martial arts are realy exciting and are a great thing to film. ",31.0
32," 2 Desember 2000 Dear Mrs Clark: I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added in next year's International Arts Festival, wich in my opinion has been a great idea to create. Although I have read that Starts and Artists came frome around the world, I have realised that they only came from only six countries. I spent a good time in the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personaly think that It would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films. The rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive, I think that  ticket was exellent for us because of its price. I look forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  2 Desember 2000 Dear Andy: I'm sorry I haven't written for so long, but I have been very busy with my exams. It's good to hear that you have passed all of them. In your letter you told me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion for your homework ?Don't you? You know that I'm studing in a hard school, and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework everyday. The other day I arrived five minutes late and the teacher ordered me to go home. ?Do you understand this? She might be crazy I have friends that are studing in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom. At home it's very different, as you know I have a very good parents that let me do a lot of things. they let me go out with my friends every day, but they make me do homework and I hate this!! I hope that it is what you wanted from me. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours ",34.00
137," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment about your theatre. On the advertisement, that I have received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour. And there were no discounts available either, unlike it was written in the same advertisement. Another disappointing point was that I wanted to watch Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him. And the actor's performance was terrible. And finally, after the show I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to eat, but it was closed because of restoration. There was no notice about it in your advertisement. Because of all these reasons, which I have listed above, my evening which should have been perfect, turned into a disaster. So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And now the situation was becoming harder to get on with. On one side it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret. But on the other side it was her best friend's family, that she must lie to. Her best friend was going out with a boy that night, And she told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat's house, in order to get permission. So Pat could not decide what to do. She did not trust the boy, and it was very hard for her to lie to people, that she liked so much. And she realized that if something happens to her best fried, it would be her fault and her best friend's parents would blame her for it. She knew she would be very sorry too. So she decided to call the parents of her best friend and tell them what was going on. Of course, her best friend would never trust her again and never share any secrets, but she was doing this for her best friends sake, wasn't she? ",34.0
47," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited. First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great. It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from six countries. Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world. Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although, some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival. Another disadvatage of the festival's programme was  lack of plays and films which are the best  to display the modern county's culture. I suppose. I hope there will be more of them next year. I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced. In conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done. For example, the next year's one may last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for  greater amount of people. The programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs. Thank you for your kind attention. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Everybody wants to earn a bit of money. Especially young people who are always out of their small budget. Fortunatelly, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays. Of course, young people can work only in their spare time. It mean that a job should be part-time. So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish for example. Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy however. But you can earn more. Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday. But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may chose a more pieceful job of a typist at home. There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer. So, you can help them and earn quiete enough. To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in  Arctic. ",30.00
1041," Dear Mr Robertson, I'd like thank you  to take us on a trip to London and have made such a good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich. It also will be ""The London fashion and leisure show"" on the 14th of March, which consist on an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Indeed it will be free for us as we are students. As you know we are in England to learn your language and also  your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country! May I suggest an alternative ? We could go to  science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery . We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would leave us go to  show on tuesday, because we can use the wednesday's free time to do our shopping. I hope that my idea sweet you and you'll agree. Sincerely,  [SEP]  Tuesday, 12th December Dear Annette, Thank you for your letter, like usual, it's a pleisure to receive a word from you. I understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present, and you'd like give to him a book, which, I think, it's a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastique book, which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories. It's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties. I recone that it's quite not an easy reading, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's such good in litteracy, that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personnality. It'll be a good point for her general culture, Wuthering Heights it's a classic, which everybody knows about it, even if they didn't have read it, they, at liest, know the story. Let me know what would be your choice. Love from, ",24.00
915," Dear Helen RYAN, I'm the winner of the first prize in your competion and I'm writing to you to give  some information which was required for you. Your first question was about when I'd like to travel. Well, it's only possible in July because of the University's holiday (during the rest of the year I'm attending to the classes). If I can choose  accommodation I  prefer  log cabins, because when I've been in Camps , it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation. It's really difficult choose two activities from that list. Everyone are very interesting. Anyway, I think Basketball could be the right  because it's the sport that I'm practising from I was a child and photography because it's my hobby on my free time, I'm really enjoy it and I can say I'm so good in it. I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals, Are they provided? or can we find some places to buy it? I suppose it's everything that you need from me. Any other question don't hesitate to ask me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. I think shopping is a subject really up to date. I can say that nowadays  is growing up very quickly in our society like a kind of sport or hobby to waste or spend the free time. And it's creating a lot of adict people, call ""shopalcoholics"". Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for, perhaps because it is not  your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms waiting stand up for your turn. After that,  the unfriendly and sometime's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down. But never mind! the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit  because your feet are killing you and  realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.

346," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writting  you about an enjure that I had in your last musical  Circle Theatre. I went to see ""Over the rainbow"" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening. First of all, I was surpprising that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not played. Anybody told us why they wasn't there. I read on your advertisment in Friday's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the representation started at 20.15. I was waitting 45 minutes for anything! I am  studiant and I didn't find any discount's ticket. I don't understand the problem between your advertisment and the reality. And finally, after the show, I wanted to drink a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed! Like mentioned in the newspaper I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Your sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? My life change everyday with the modern technology. For exemple, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I am going on  Internet and ask for what I need. The day after I get everything at home by post. In my point of vue,  Internet is the most important discover of the 2000 centery. You can book tickets for  theatre, sport, etc., you can find all  informations you need for yourself. You have a lot of things to do, to see, to learn. It is too big to tell everybody about what you can do! I use  all the time Internet for my homework and in the futur, I hope, I will be able to use it for my own work. Technology will not stop to grow up and help people in the futur. I hope I will help them, I am sure I will! ",25.0
758," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you wanted. Firstly, you asked me about the period I'd prefer to travel: For me, the only solution is July, because I've already something planned in August. Concerning the accommodation, I'd prefer to spend my nights in a log cabin, because I've great difficulty sleeping in a tent. You also mentionned the activities I'll be able to do. I chose tennis and golf. Althoug I've been playing tennis for five years, I can't say I'm a very good player. And I'm even worse at golf, because I've never been playing it before. But I enjoy discovering  new activities! In addition to this, I would be grateful if you could send me  information on these few details: what kind of clothes is required? How is the weather at this period of the year? And should I take some money with me? How much? I hope you will be able to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Hermine Damien  [SEP]  ""Cry Freedom"" If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", from John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice? Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries. However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage,  love of justice,  fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them. To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story. ",36.0
305," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the terrible evening I spent in your theatre. Just to remind you of which show I am talking about, it is called ""Over the Rainbow"". There were  couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made  fool of my self by arriving late and  all those people starring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board, it said that they are available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day. The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back. Yours faithfully, Raulet.  [SEP]  Well, for instance people in Roman times (Roman soldiers) didn't have any sort of transport to move them from one place to another. The only way they could move was  their feet. They could walk over 4 km per day without any breaks. But people in nowadays like me can't even walk 1 km. And also what is the point of walking when you have cars and buses or even bikes. Phones also affected my daily routine. If I wanted to find one of my friends, I had to run around our hood finding him but now, I just have to phone  on his mobile phone and just ask him where he is. Computers changed my daily routine because when I was younger, I was spending most of my days outside playing basketball but now, I just play on the computers all day. E-mails are also one of my examples. When e-mails didn't exist, I was writing letters and it took longer to get to the person I am writing to but with e-mails, the person could receive my message within  few seconds and you don't have to count in how many days  he will receive it. So in my opinion, modern technology changed my daily routine quiet a lot. ",30.0

To answer your questions, I would like to tell you, what my travel can be possible only on July, because I will have the Cambrigge exam till 1 July. Would it be possible to have accomodation at Camp California in a tent, because I didn't have  chance to sleep into it. And would it be possible to do swimm and surf. I am very good  swimming. I done it since I remeber me. In surf I am not good at all. I have been driming about this activitie since I had 10 years old.

Because it's crowding of people. I'd like to be in small boutiques, and I would rather go to shopping along and during the weekand time.

220," Dear manager, Last week I went to the Circle theatre, of which you are responsable, to se the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had joined the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you have changed the program. Moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19.30; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket's price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner. So it was not ""my perfect evening out"" and because of my disappointment I am here to ask you  some money back.  [SEP]  I think modern technology has changed human's life a lot, expecially starting with the last century. The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out: I live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so I cannot go to the city using a bycicle. Because of my ""isolation""  telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and  internet so study or do researches, because there are not  book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like very much play guitar, and in my free time I prefer play electric, than acoustic or classic guitar using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.

For my surprise Danny Brook never apeard. There was a different actor instead and it put me very nervous. He is my favorite actor and I pay to saw him not to saw a different actor. Finally at the end of the sow I decided to went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it wasn't been repeard yet. I think you must told people about this in the advertisement.

Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report Subject: Video about daily life at our school. Introduction: To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spend some time discussing it with other students,  observing and analaising an avrege day in our scholl and came up with some suggestions. Places to video: We should try to video not only class rooms but also our playground, cafe, sport hall, art club & library. Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are  very important part of our school life. Activities to video: We should show students during their formal studies as well as after lessons. I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as  anual sport turnament or wellcoming evening for new students. Conclugen: To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not to film anything longer than 1 or 2 minuts and have a nice mixture of places, faces and events. If you have any further comments or questions regarding this case please let me know. King Regards ",28.0
264," Dear Sir/MADAME, I am writting  you because yesterday I went to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" and I had a bad evening. First of all, in the advertisement  says that the starring were different actors, and there weren't different one, so that can not be. Also in the advertisement  says, that the show will begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that mean that I have to cancelled a date that I had at 21:00, because I coudn't make it. If you present a show you must be on time. Another thing that happened was that the tickets did not have discount and the advertisement says the will have. So, how is  possible that you present an advertisement and you don't make what it say? Finally, it supose to have the restaurant open, and it wasn't, because they didn't have electricity to cook, so they close it. I am really made and I want my money back, please call me to the number 23456789, I will be waiting  your call. Thank  for your time your sincerelly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects. First of all at work; computer are really amazing, you only need to turn it on and start to write; your work is more clean and you work faster. Also change my free time, they had invented great games like play station, and you can have a really good time with your friend playing. In the early day, on a raining day you couldn't play because most of game were  outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house. Another aspect is , on the house artefacts, microwaves, laundrymachine, make life easily. In my opinion technology have made human life easily, funier and more comfortable. ",22.0
16," Dear Jane Clark Hello, I spent two days at your annual international arts festival. I was very impressed and I wish you could make the festival better next year. I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other country's art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many country's people. You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small  that the people can't even dance in classical concerts. This years' 'plays and films' was too short. I was very disappointed about this, but the other shows were great. I felt very good about all these shows. In my opinion, the tickets for all events is a wonderful idea, because everybody has a chance to see everything and the people would think this is a great festival. What do you think about picking five people and give them tickets for 'Art Travel'? I think this is a good idea. Generally it was very good and I wish more people would come next year. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back  soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same. First, In school, we are not allowed to run. This is very important, because many accidents happen because of running. When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best  what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other student's study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday. I think the main rule is when you can play computer games, because they love computer games. Tell me about English rules. I'm curious about it. Your best wishes from   ",27.00

Firstly, I would like to inform  that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month. The reason for it, is that, July is the only month in which, I am on holidays so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer stay in  tents rather than stay in  log cabins because I appreciate having straight contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and  climbing I used to climb trees, walls everything in my childhood without falling. Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money would  be adviseable to take and what kind of clothe I should take. I look forward  an answer from you. Yours Faithfully Adriana  [SEP]  I am just writing to tell you about my experience about helping at a pop concert. Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have the unique opportunity to take  pictures  with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay  your ticket it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were not disadvantages.

As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job. July is the only free time that I have.

It is very kind for you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to have climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town. For sailing, well, I haven't try it before, that is why I want to have a try. I think it must be fun. As you said, all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but I am sure I still need  some money with me. How much do you think that I will need. By the way what kinds of clothes do you think I have to get with me? And is there anything eles I have to get with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think most people will agree with ""shopping is not always enjoyable"". Because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time. Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing shopping. Yes, it is true, this is only because nowadays people have more money than even before, and some women don't earn money, they have no idea how diffcult  to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable! So it is depend on different case. For me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only go to shop unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me, I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you face  the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do. Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of  times, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifes, they are hopeless. Those are only my opinions, you don't need to agree with it, but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong.

737," Dear Helen Ryan: I am writing to give you the information it was ask in the letter you had sent me. Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be  the second week of July because I will be very busy in any other date for reasons of work. Secondly I would prefer sleeping in  log cabins because I  fell much more comfortable. One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems in my back. Finally, the two activities I would like to do while I am camping are Singing and Basketball. The first one because I think I am good at it and also I love singing loudly with other people. The last one I have never tried it but I think I can do it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier. I would like to know if I must take some money and what kind of clothes I will need. I look forward to hearing from you. your sincerily  [SEP]  Dear Kim: I'm very sorry I haven't written  you for such a long time but I had to make a travel to my parents house because my mother was operated on; don't worry she is all right now. Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing. It was a wonderful experience but at the same time I had to work very hard. The things I did were: Prepearing and controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc. The most exciting thing was talking with the band, asking questions to them and of course listening  the music and enjoying the incredible show. It was the most exciting experience I've ever had in my life. Best wishes. ",29.0

FIRS OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY TIME I WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL IS IN JULY, BECAUSE BEFORE THAT I HAVE TO TAKE SOME EXAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY. IN YOUR LETTER YOU ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD PREFER, IF A TENT OR A LONG CABIN. WELL, THE ANSWER IS A LONG CABIN, BECAUSE I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY BACK.

THEN SOME HOURS BEFORE THE CONCERT, I MET THE BAND AND THEY LET ME STAYED IN THE SOUND TEST. I WAS  ALREADY SPECIAL TIME FOR ME! THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND WERE VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY WITH ME. THEN, WHEN THE CONCERT STARTED; THE ORGANISERS GAVE ME AN IDENTITY CARD,  ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE STAFF. THAT CARD WAS THE BEST THING THAT SOMEONE HAD EVER GAVE TO ME, BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO BE IN THE SCENARY WITH THE WHOLE BAND! IT WAS THE BEST TIME IN MY LIFE. I FELT REALLY LUCKY. SORRY IF MY EXPERIENCE WAS BORING BUT I KNOW YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU. I SEND YOU SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME WITH THE BAND. LOT OF LOVE, ",30.0
1227," Dear Maria, I would be pleased to help you about all your questions and I will provide you  some information which you need as much as I can. I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay. As you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week, we can say that   a kind of relaxation time. Nothing will be spacial. Place is  College garden. Time is 7 pm. There is no need to bother  about clouths. Everybody can put on something casual. Befor  leav from England I suggest you to visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke. You could find the opportunaty to see the country life. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Time flies I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word. I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our times passing so fast. Can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus. May be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot. Try to imagine your life without having anyof them. Wouldn't  be unbarable and painful. Ceartainly it would be just like mine. Because I live in a rural area far from any village, town, or city center. The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot. I have no car,  no local bus service to use. Even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me. And ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life. But also I'm aware of that the time flies for me. I must do whatever I want befor it is too late. And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity. ",23.00
804," Dear Helen Ryan, I have happily received your reply letter and I want to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only period of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should give me a good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity and entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis for you. I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good in it. At tennis I'm the best player of my whole school and once, I got to the top 10 of my country in tennis . I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring? Money, how much should I bring. Would $200 be enough? Well that's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely Basilio Romero  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shoke our hands. I'll never wash my hands again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon. Basilio Romero ",35.0
102," 17.06.2000 Hello Sir, ""Um very unpleased that I have to write you this letter. I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much. On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" in the ""Circle Theater"". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just  a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed because of renovations""! We thought it would be a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something. I would prefer getting my money back, instead of taking a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again! Sincerely Hedwiga Heinkel  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from the day on, that  he knows anything about our secret we will live in danger  being caught. We, that were Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me Hedwiga had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we won't attack them. We had this idea first, when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love of first slight and we were fascinated by the thought,  building a kind of the same organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heaed of some people paying, ""safty-money"", but never know the reason, until he found a big amout of money in my room. His thoughts combined and ready to go to the police he went out of our house, where me and my homies were just hanging aroud. He saw me and tolled me into my face you are a thief and a burglar and I will go now to the police, I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah fokes, that was the point I got interupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but when you will hear the end of my story than buy the ""Rossall-School-magazin"", net time again, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.

575," June 5, 2000 Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am writing this letter because I would like to express my happiness. This is the first time I won a prize in these kind of competitions so I would like to clear some doubts. First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work  and my parents wish to see me in this month, so if it is possible to arrange the date it would be very nice. Second, I use to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer if it is possible to be in  tents, because it would be a original experience . Third, I love playing basketball, I am a great player and I play with my University and I like to be playing all the time so this activity I will not missed. The other activity would be surf. I think  is very cool and I want to learn. Finally, I want to know what kind of clothe I will need and if have to take  money for shops or markets. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly, Jason Andre.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. You have to be all the time walking, so your legs will feel pain, hurted at the final of the day, you will be very tired and you would want to hang around for two months. If I go alone  is very fast and I enjoy it but if I go with my mother it would be horrible, I will have to do a sacrifice. I will have to be waiting until my mother decides which is the best place to buy her dress. She will see if it is pretty or not, if it is in discount at other store we will not buy the dress and we will have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but at the final of seeing all the stores and looking  all the dresses she will decided for the first  we saw. It is horrible. Is like a nightmare. ",18.0
559," Dear Mrs. Ryan, in your letter I received a few days ago, you asked me to give you some more information concerning my journey to the U.S.A. I'm a teacher in Vienna, my holiday starts on July 1st. For August I booked a journey to Greece with my wife. That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S. in July. I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I gothave become accostomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at the army - I would prefer  log cabin for my stay in the camp. Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy, I still enjoy swimming especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition, that means I do swimming just for fun. The other activity I choose is Photography. Usually I take just holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art.... I think there are no more questions I'm looking forward to seeing you. Yours  [SEP]  I'm the teacher of that class. The children are seven to eight years old. The video that will be made should demonstrate how  day in school is like. - I start the day by greeting the children and they answer - in English, of course. Then I tell them to sit down. - The first lesson will deal with animals on a farm. I will show pictures of animals and the children will tell me the name of that animal. - Later on we'll go to sing the song of ""Old McDonald had a farm"". - The third part of the film will show the children's painting work ""Animals on a farm"". - Some sequences of the gym-lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that presents how  children have their lunch and spend their free-time, what games they play in the school-yard and how they have contact with each other. Each part of the film mentioned above should not be longer than 5 to 10 minutes. The whole film when it's finished will last for about half an hour. ",30.0
1146," Dear Ms. Belinda Marriott, My name is Akihiro and I'm a member of an English club at West Isle College. I'm writing this letter to invite you to the event which I'm organizing for people who want to improve their English, as our teacher told me that you have come to live in our area. Our English club is not a very big one, with 14 students and a teacher. Most of the students are between 18 and 22 years old, but there are some elder , the eldest is 28 years old. We all love to learn English. At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech. You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice. I'm planning the event on 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you. After the event, I'd like to offer you a dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  I had never taken birthdays serious, both my own and  of others, until I had that really special day on my twenty-fourth birthday. I was born in May, which is the busiest month for school teachers in Japan. Unfortunately, both of my parents are teachers. In my childhood, they were always too busy to remember my birthday and I didn't remember my birthday either. When I was 23, I joined a NGO in Denmark and stared living with other members, most of who are from Europe. On that day, I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday. I had never had a birthday party before and I didn't expect much. The party was far beyound my expectation. 20 people from five different countries celebrated for me. I had never felt happier. I still often forget my birthday, but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago.  ",36.00
300," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because of the unpleasent evening I have spent recently. I have always thought that  plays of the Circle Theatre are worth of seeing, but two days before I was very disappointed after visiting yours theatre. Ealyer I had seen an advertisement for the show but the informationes on it caused fals. First of all I have not seen my favourite actor Danny Brook. The second think is that the play did not start at 19:30 but at 20:15! I could not get a discount. The last think is that it was unpossible to get  the theatre restaurant because it was closed. I was told that it had been painted but nobody had written it on an advertisement. At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Modern technology is changing  world every day. I would like to write  how it has influented my daily life. I am a student of a technical univercity. Some time before I did not know  the internet. When I neaded some informationes I had to go to  liblary to find it in books or newspapers. Now the only think I have to do is to go to  computer room and turn on the computer. The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast. I just send an e-mail and that is all! The second think is that when I neaded a phone card to call somebody I had to stay in a long queue. Now I just only put some money into a machine and I can take the card from there! The last example is that I have in my house a lot of modern equipment like  TV set, fridge or microwaves which help me for my living. It is obvious that modern technology has changed my daily life.

1132," Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we write this letter to you, is because we would like to thank you for this short trip in London. We believe that the programme is very cood and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that. The other reason as I mention earlier is because of a request off all the class. We've seen an advertisement in the newspapers, about a Fashion exhibition in London on Tuesday the 14 of March. That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a college. So we had this great idea if it is possible of course to include this exhibition in our programme. The exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it taking place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London From 10.00 till 19.00. The class is very exiting about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make up and hair styles. We believe that  is a great opportunity because  is one of the best shows of the year, also a majority of the class never had the change to visit a show as this and the most important and best part is that the admission is Free for Students. And that we found it very good as otherwise we could not afford it. So please if it is possible  to make a small change to the programme and to move the activities of the Tuesday 14 of March to the 15 of March  as to try to make a combination of the 2 days. We hope we do not cause any problems to your programme and hope that you will except our request. From all your class Thank you  [SEP]  ""FAME"" What a word!! I'm sure that the people that had decided to meet this word they did not realised that there is a price to pay. I believe that any famous people such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for a various reasons. First of all they are humans like everyone else, so yes everyone want privacy in their lifes. is the same right for all of us as a human be. Of course on you are on the public eye, the reasons are different when you want privacy. Becaues if you are a politician as an exmaple, you fear for your life. You need to protect your life of any danger. Becaue  ",25.00
105," Sir, Madame I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. But I was not very satisfied after my ""perfect evening"" out. The advertisement for the Musical Show was very good, but the information was not correct. You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing. In the advertisement  was written that the show will start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later, at 20.15! Because of the advertisement I thought that I can   discount  the tickets available but I couldn't. After the show I need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved, but it was closed. And there was no reason why . So you can see that it was not a so perfect  evening for me then I thought. Now I hope that you can understand my question for some money back because of the trouble I had.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secretes. This was the only reason why that she had not  a lot of friends. When Pat  came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few time the others have seen that Pat can't keep secrets. So they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important. Sometimes it finished like this that the others only said: ""Hello, how are you?"" and then went away without listening  the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams were coming. She dreamed about good friends,  time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets. Then one day she met this person. It was Katha, a girl who had the same problems like Pat. So they found both the person they dreamed from. ",25.0
152," Dear Sir/Madam. I'm writing to complain about the theatre show you did last week because there were too many irregularities during the show. Firstly, the guests stars who were supposed to play were different  and very disappointing because they stopped the show twice. Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late when it was supposed to start at 19:30 and anyone explained to us, the public, what was happening. To make matters worse when we bought the tickets, they were too much expensive and there weren't any discounts for young people or for groups. But the worst happened when the show finished, because we (my girlfriend and I) were hungry and the theatre restaurant was closed. Maybe, this was the worst show I have ever seen and for this  I'll wait for the refund. Your's Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so we couldn't explain her what happened that night. Jon had crashed with Pat's boyfriend car and he told her that someone had kicked the car with a metal stick. Pat's boyfriend couldn't believe that story but Pat trusted in Jon and she thinked that he was honest. However, Jon felt very disappointed and he told the truth. At the beggining they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him. Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't explain her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend. It could be worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything to her. ",24.0

1220," Dear Mrs Smith, I was very please to receive your letter. It is my pleasure to help you  organising the international student conference. Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located on the town centre. Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach, as there are about 35 internation students,  they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at  college main hall, at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June. There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided. Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on. Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wearing pub-wears to it, as it is suitable for dancing. Finally, on the last day, I suggest you could go  the market at town during the 3-hour gap. It is a nice place to buy the British style gifts to your family and friends. You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby. I would be grateful to give any help if you need. I am looking forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From: Genevieve Chiu To: Group leader of  American students Subject: Interesting building to visit in Hong Kong Visiting Po Lin Temple The purpose of this  is to give information to the American students, describing Po Lin Temple is worth-visited. 1. Brief history of Po Lin Temple: It was found in 1910. It is a traditional type of chinese temple. Because of the 2nd World War, it was re-built in 1960. A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world. 2. Location: The location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong. 3. Opening and Closing time: Po Lin Temple is opened to  public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday. 4. Transports You could take the MTR (HK underground) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there. Then you need to take the bus A110, A111 or A112 to Po Lin Temple. It is quite convenient. All the buses and  MTR have air-condition. 5. Attractive points: You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos. Of course, you may get more knowledge about Hong Kong, as the temple have been here for nearly 100 years. The well known Big Buhha you mustn't miss it, or you will be sorry. The temple also provide free Chinese traditional style meals for visitors. 6. Conclusion: To sum up, I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit, especially for Americans students. Easy to get there and free amittion. On the other hand, Hong Kong is known as a highly commerical city, but you could find something different in Po Lin Temple. ",27.00
373," Circle theatre's Manager: I am writting  you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There were many things that were wrong in the advertisement I saw. First the actors who were suppoused to star in this show were not the ones put in there. So when I saw the show I felt horrible, because I was expecting to see Danny Brook. But the problems started while I arrived  the place. I had a discount for it, but they refussed it and I had to pay the full price. Appart from this, the show started fourty five minutes later. I think this reasons are suficiently enough to ask for my money back. So I hope that you will understand my point. Please be comprehensive and realize that your show was not cheap. I'm a student, so I do not have a lot of money and I need it back. I also had to tell you that the theatre restaurant was closed because there were  few people there and they take me out of the place, so I was very upset. I will go to your office this week. I hope to see you there.  [SEP]  Pat's secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about the relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John, loved each other so much that it wouldn't be rare to find that they had have sex together. The point here is, that Caroline choosed the worst friend to told this . She was also concerned about being pregned, but she was afraid to told John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat react in a very wrong way and told rapidly to John. He couldn't belived what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay  a very expensive operation. But as every story this has a happy final. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her fantasy. And Pat understood that secrets should die on your own. ",26.0
717," Dear Helen: I have just received your letter, and I am very happy about this. Thanks very much! I think I would like to travel only on July because I've just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holidays in these days. It will be very nice for me. Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place, I think I will choose log cabins, it's sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to tents next time (maybe next year.) When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music, seem like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum liked me singing this song. And I can also make very good photography, because I learned  this in China two years ago. Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about  journey, What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? and how much does it cost per night live in a Hotel? Thanks for your help. Yours  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me too. But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable. Firstly, I am a student, I don't have  job, so, I have to asked  money from my parents. I can't asked  too much that's very bad for my parents. When I go shopping. I alway feel shame because I spend my parents money. (although I got  part-time job, it  just enough to pay my rent.) Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things  always expensive. You should spend more money on buying clothes and food,  you will  very happy when you buy it, but, when you come back home  take out you purse, you must be feel sad, you purse  nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money.) Sometimes, when you shopping on the street, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy it once,  you will feel very sad maybe. And then, you may save money for the things you like, nothing to do, just for the poor things what you like so funny isn't it? Another thing is when you shopping in a busy street, seem like oxford st in London. a lot of thief  there, they will steal you money, that's so dangerous. So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me. It will stop when I get a good job. Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it. ",23.0
595," 18 June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I have just received it yesterday. I am very exciting. I would like to go to California in the U.S.A. in July. It is the only month that I can have my holiday in a year and it would be nice in the summer time. About the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin. It would be nice and safe for me than the tents. The activities I would like to choose the swimming and sailing. It could be fun for me because I like swimming and sailing could be exciting too. Lastly, I would like to know about the money and clothes. How about the weather in California in July? Is it hot or raining? Then I can prepare my clothes, or can we buy some clothes there? Are they accept the credit card or only cash. I don't want to take money with me. I would be greatful if you could send me the full details. Many thanks. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the following paragraps I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages about shopping. Everyone needs to shopping everyday. It is  very important thing for our life. We need food, clothes, book etc. There are many kinds of thing for shopping and they are different for example the price, the quality In  suppermarket, shop, department store  have many things. We could buy mostly all we need in one store. It is very convenien. On the other hand, shopping is not always easy. Sometime, it's so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are  hurry while you are in the long queu. We have seen then,  shopping is very important for our life. Most people enjoy shopping because it  more convenien for today but if you found the busy place for shopping or it is not as good as you expect. It would not  enjoyable for you. ",21.0
135," Dear Sir/Madam; Yesterday I went to the theatre play called ""Over the Rainbow""  which I saw the advertisement in todays Guardian. I want to tell you that I am very dissapointed about the play. In the advirtisement it is written that Danny Brook was in the starring . However I didn't see him all the night. There was another actor instead of him. And also it should be started at 19.30, as I saw in the advirtisement,  which has started at 20.15! And so far there wasn't any discounts available which is written to be ""available"" in the advirtisement. I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re-decoration progress inside. You should have written it in the advirtisement. And after all  no one can say that I had a perfect evening out! Absolutely it was very dissapointing. so I want my money back. I hope you understand me and correct your mistakes in the next advirtisement and send me my money soon! Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Simple Solutions It is over 50 years since the production of the computer and television. Our lifes changed since then Today every 5 out of 10 pupil can use  computer basicly. And almost everybody has a television in their homes. These 2 devices make my life easier. I can't go out all the time or be with my friends to have fun. So I watch Tv at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window. I play   computer more than watching Tv when I get bored. The internet is the world's largest communication system ever made. I can do anything I want such as buy Cd's watch  film or even buy food. It is really enjable when I chat with pupil.  Internet brought a new way to my live since I started to use it. It is easy and very useful. I can reach any knowledge that I want to. Techology is also important in one subject for me. Transportation. I can't have to walk to school everyday for 8 months, Cars, busses and trains are very useful in daily life. Lots of thing would be hard and boring in my life  I was living in a different time than now. I can easily do what I want. Technology brought simple solutions to my life. ",24.0
764," Dear Mrs. Ryan. I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize. It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July. I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is  for going with my parents to France. This has been scheduled 3 months ago. About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents. While I'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball, as I have been playing both sports all my life, and I have to say that I am very good at both. There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp. I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes. I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me. I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes  is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like. The Sports Shop. You cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is allways what we want. That's men's intention. Another point is to go  a big area. Specially  week-ends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to take a license to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out. In conclusion, for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all. ",32.0
1140," Dear Mrs Brown, It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come at the party. All the students wanted to organise a surprise party for Mr Brown. Next Tuesday is his birthday. We would like you to come and if you can to help us in an important decision. Firstly, we should tell you that it is a surprise party. He must not learn about it subsequently you must not tell him. Secondly, the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June at  College Canteen. We think the suitable time will be 3-6 p.m. You can come earlier, if you want. We would have junky food, some juices and drinks. Moreover, will come some teacher, of course all the students and the Principal. On the other hand, we do not know what to give him as a present. Can you help us? We want something that it would like him or  would be necessary. Please try to come and help us to this problem. We ar looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  John said he had some good news to tell me. I am waiting  him to come. Suddenly the bell rings. I thought that  would be John and  was he. We had finished the exams two weeks ago and we were waiting for the results. The first good new was that we both had passed the exams. It was a wonderful new. Then we thought about going for swimming to discuss about some things. The second new was that he had found a job for the summer. He would go to work in a café. He would earn a lot of money, in addition they wanted an another person. As a result I had a work too. We had the greatest day. Then we had an idea! We would have much money from the work. At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia. We imagine that would be the best holidays in our life. ",25.0
116," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain some aspects about your show. It was a desaster and I am  telling you why. I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, but I had a bad surprise; he was not in the show! How could you change the actors without saying something to the visitors. The show was supposed to start at half past seven and started a quarter past eight. Forty-five minutes later! It was incredible. Apart from that, the advertisement mention that there were discounts available, and there were not. It mention that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show, too, and we could not because it was closed, and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us. I am very disappointed, and if it is possible, I want you to return my money back. I hope that the next time you will do a better show than the last one. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For me technology affects me a lot may be more than science, because my daily life is plenty of objects with technology, such us television, radio, transports, etc. But it has advantatges as   disadvantatges. On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watching television or listening to music. Or if I want to go shopping or to another city, it is necessary to use the car or the public transport. On the other hand there are disadvatatges, too. Firstly, the enviroment is polluted because of technology, although  is our fault. Secondly for us  is a disadvantatge because the pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watching television, and it isn't very good at all. And finally, because I spend a lot of money buying games for the computer, that it's a very good technology, too. To sum up, technology it's the best thing around the world, apart from T.V. ",27.0
497,"  Dear manager of the Circle Theatre Last Sanday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the theatre you were supposed to present. We thought that it was a good chance for us to watch it. ""Over the rainbow"" was supposed to start at seven thirty. We went there on time. We waited ther for forty five minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it. We really got bored as all the other peaple there. We were very disappointed because before this happened we pouded the tickets but there were no discounts available. And then delate forty five minuites to present the show. Then we expected to, see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook. That was very disapponted. Fortunately the show finished. We decided to visit the theatre restaurant. But it was closed!! That was  bad organized evening we thought. When we asked why was it closed the people there told us that they did not organized it before I must admit that, that evening wasn't the perfect one out for me but I and for my friends either. It was the worst evening that we all ever had. My friends and I demand our money bacck real soon. And please do not be very suprised If you recieve more letters about this  [SEP]  Unfortunately; Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I did a big mistake by trusting him. What a fool was I. Last Wednesday my sister told me that our grandmother had a serious illness and she was going to die. She told me to tell none. We didn't want out grand-mother to find it out at that moment so we was trying to keep it secret. I knew Pat, my cousin, loved our grandmother very much. She and Pat had a special relationship. Despite the fact that I had to tell nothing I thought it was right to tell Pat the truth. After a lot of thought I told it to him. Pat started screaming and shouting. I knew he couldn't stand it. But I was sure he would tell nothing. I was wrong. He told me that he had to tell it to my grandmother. I couldn't do anything. Just as Pat left my house he went right away to the hospital. He found her there. And the worst happened. My grandmother was very sensitive and bored  life and when she heart it her condition became more serious. After two days she died. Pat my sister and I felt very rensposible. But there was nothing we could do. We knew we had lost her for ever. ",25.0
899," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I have received a letter from you saing that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me. I would like to travel on July because my hollydays are only on it and the wheather in California is better . I am that kind of person who enjoy to have a wild and simple life, so I prefer to be accommodated in tents. About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball which I have a lot of experience . The second one is sailing, but I am not so good in this sport. I would like to know some more information about the Camp, before I left, which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me. Yours sincerely Augusto Roy  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How is everything? Is your dog better? Well here I'm very fine. I bought a new T.V., it's very big and I love it! In your last letter  said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I enjoy it very much, it was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be the responsable with  lights and sound. I told then that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job. The most increible part was the laser show. They were drowing a lot of things in the sky during the concert. Next time I'll take you and your friend Monica. I'm shure that you are going to love it. Please write back Love and Peace Augusto. ",21.0
25," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about the International Arts Festival which has just finished. I congratulated with you because it has been a great idea since the town needed a cultural event. I especially appreciate the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford, also students like me. However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances. You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have appreciate seeing more of them. For next year's edition, you could possibly add some foreign films, like the Chinese ones, which I most like. Finally, in order to make  a really international festival, I think you should invite artists from all over the world, not just from six countries like this year. I hope that you will appreciate my opinions and suggestions, which I have shared with my friends.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Simply a good idea and that's enough Are you young and full of life but you don't have enough money to enjoy your spare time? Simply let your brain work and you could find out wonderful ideas to earn money enjoying yourself. Are you fed up of looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend. Are you keen on music and you love going to disco? With a short training  you'll be able to mix songs at parties. You won't dance but the earning is guarantee! Do you like do-it-yourself and your house is full of marvellous but unuseful things? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room!  So, what are  waiting for? Work out your own idea and realise it: money won't be a problem for you anymore! ",34.00

I am going to write about  information which you want to know. First, I would like to travel in only July, because I have got a job and only July is the time I can have a vacation. Secondly, I would like to choose a tent for accommodation, because I have never spent time in a tent, that's why, I think it is a good oppotunity for me. I would like to choose swimming and photography for activities. I have a planty of experience and knowledge of both aspect of part. Lastly, I would like to ask you two questions. One of them is that what kind of clothes  suitable on this camp. Another one is that how much money I have to prepare. I will be greatfull if you could inform me. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Hi! How are you doing? I had a wonderful time last month. I helped  a pop concert as a charity. My jobs were collecting a ticket, saling goods and refreshment, guiding people to a right seat and cleaning up the concert hole after finish a concert. I wasn't allowed to help  a heavy work, even though I wanted to do, because I'm  woman. What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert had achived by our supports. It seemed that all people,  audience, the band and  stuffs were delightful. If I have  chance, I want to help  a concert again. I have never felt such as satisfaction. I really recomend you to help them, I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you understand my feeling well. I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you .

112," Dear Sir, I'm writting this letter to complain about your fake advertisement. You are the theatre's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain . First of all in your show advertisement  sais that Danny Brooks starts in the play. But a different actor has started and that was very disappointing not only for me but for all  people there. The show has begun later, much more later than your advertisement writes, at about 20:15. The show started 45 minutes later. This made me get bored. You also refer to your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any. At the end you have written that there is the theatre restaurant  after the show but there wasn't. It had closed because of the late start of the show. At the end because I; hadn't have a perfect evening but a very disappointing one, I have the right to ask  my money back.   [SEP]  Modern technology changed not only my daily life but also the life of many people. Now let's talk about me. First of all I don't have to worry n the morning  if I miss the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time. Usually When I return from school the food is a lit of bit cold so I put it in the microwave to become  hotter. When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch in my country especially in summer  is too hot. So I turn on the aircondition with  timer so when I get  sleep  to turn off by itself. When I wake up if I don't have homework I sit on my computer and play different games to spend my time. At the evenings before I got to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV through the sattelite. When I go to bed because there are many mosquitoss I turn on a special machine with  pile like thing in it which kills them. I belive that modern technology has effected possitive our lives. ",23.0
989," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to provide you with the information that you require to arrange my two week holidays at Camp California in the U.S.A I would like to travel in July because, as I am working, this is the only time that I have to go on holidays. About the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have  bad back and I think that to sleep in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me. You also told me that I would have the chance of doing two activities. I would like to go climbing, because it is something that I have been doing since I was a child, so I could consider myself an expert in it. And I would like to try golf because this is a sport that I have never practised but I have always wanted to try. Finally, I would like to enquire about how much money I should take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie always enjoyable?' Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie, it is also true that  is definetly not an enjoyable one. ",37.0
1023," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you to thank you for the organising our programme for a trip to London, I'm  student at  College of Economics and I was chosen to write to you about this matter. Our class really appreciate for preparing this programme, especially for Monday's atraction. We are extremaly interested in wisiting London. The idea of sightseeing by bus would be a great possibility for us to know better our wonderful capitol. Although we are excited about the scientic, I would like you to ask, if it would be possible to change our schedule a little bit. In  last edition of 'London's Guide' we saw an advert of 'The London Fasion and Leisure Show', which will be held on Tuesday and it lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentiones  'latest fasions', which we are incredible interested in. In addition it recommends also  'Leisure and Sports Wear'. Thing which attract us the most are: 'Make up' and 'Hairstyles'. We strongly recommend it, because students' admission is free. I'm convinced that you agree with us and we take part in this show. We would be terribly grateful, if you accept our offer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Nowedays famous people don't have an easy life. They are always attacted by naughty journalists, which have  aspiration to earn big money for writing an extremaly good report, or article. To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly. In addition we are fascinated in their marriage, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known. By chosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look like. On the other hand, their life has no privaty. In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxiously and lonely. They are always under high pressure in their every-day life, because they are afraid of being recognise. Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions and films-stars belong to the public. In conclusion, I belive that we have  right to be informed about their life, providing that journalists respect some important rules. ",25.00
590," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for informing that I won the prize. I was very pleased to hear that. I am writing to inform you the information you asked me . As for the date to travel, I would like to go there in July. Owing toe the summer course I take starting in August, July is the only month I have free time. With regard to  place to stay, I would be most grateful if I could stay in a log cabin. I never could sleep in a tent in my life. I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities. Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some picture of beautiful scenaries in California. As photography, swimming is my best way of relaxation. It would be grateful if I could go swimming during the stays. Finally, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take there, and how much money I would need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although shopping is one of the most popular ways to reduce your stress, this is not always the case. There are some negative points that I would like to make about shopping. First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is looking around all  shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't find ones!! That's would be so exhausting. Next thing you have to do is trying them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms. After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted clothes taking off and putting on. That's a hell!! That's not the end of the story. You need to go home with bulky bags in both of your hands!! To sum up, although there is certainly a good side of shopping, such as  pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for  long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.

1207," Dear Mrs. Smith, In reply to your letter, I would like to answer your questions and give you more information. Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is  'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and  no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party would be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you could wear something quite casual. Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount. I hope this letter should help you with enough information. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Could modern people live without a light bulb? Well, I don't think so. Only people who could live without it, must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation! We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly  happens! Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply. I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in  toilet, all the light was turned off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be, and I was sure I can never, ever live without it. ",34.00
31," Dear Jane Clark, I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you have organized. I enjoyed it very much and I think you have had a great idea. I went to all the events, they were really good. I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world, even if the number of countries was very little, only six. Why don't you let more countries to participate next year? I also liked the concerts. But, can I give you a suggestion for next year? Try to find bigger halls, because this year they were really too small! I enjoyed all the plays and films, but they were fewà why don't you broadcast more at  next Festival? I also went to the dance shows, the art exhibition and the talks by writers, they were really very nice and interesting. I also agree with you about the ticket's prize. In fact, it was really a reasonably-priced ticket, excellent because you could go to all the events only with it. And that's the reason because lots of people came. An admiree  [SEP]  Capua, 16/12/2000 Hi Jane, how are you? I received your letter yesterday, and I want to answer you soon! I think the discussion in your class was very interesting. In my country there are different rules at school, but I think they are, more or less, the same in England. You have to begin your lesson at 8.25 and wait for the teacher of the next lesson in the class. You have a break of ten minutes, that you would have to do in class. You can't speak during the lesson or outside the classrooms. You can't write on walls and desks.. I have some rules also at home, but they are few. I can do everything I want, except going out with the car during the night. My parents are afraid of it because I took my licence only in September. My parents also like eating all together, but it isn't a rule, only an habitude! I don't think there is something I'd like to change! I like my life, both at school and at home!

I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California, because I have never gone to  U.S.A. I would prefer to travel only in July, because I have not to work and because I would prefer to have accomodation in  tent and so I think that july is the best period to spend two weeks in  tent. I have just been  in  tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interested adventure. During the journey I would do surfing and photography. I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I had gone to a surfing-course for five years and I won a lot of prizes. I like also doing photography because they can be memories IN my future. I would  receive further information about which kind of clothes I should put off during my holiday and I would  know if I should bring with me a lot of money. Looking forward to spending my holiday in the USA I wait  your letter. Your sincerelly Guillelmina Farina.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am afraid that I couldn't write  you immediatly, but last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so I am very busy. Even if the job was so hard, it was an amused experience. I woke up at six a.m. and I worked until nine p.m. but it isn't a problem for me, because I like spending my time with other people. I particularly liked to know people of different countries and some pop-stars, which were friendly with us. I was surprised of the co-operation that there was during the job, because it was as a big family, where each member helped  others. There was a lot of work to do but we were happy to do it with glad people and at the end we had the possibility to take part in the pop concert. It was wonderful! Looking forward to meeting you as soon as possible. I greet you. Best wishes Guillelmina ",25.0
967," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have won the first prize! I am extremly happy about this. I am writing because of same information that you need. I have only the possibility to take  holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginn of August. Of course I would like to stay in a tent. When I was a child we were often camping. To stay in a tent will remind my of a unforgottable time. There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes  hard to choose only two. Given the circumstances I would like to learn more about Photograhy and Painting. I have same skills in drawing landscape but I have no idea about photography. Taking picture is a new experience for me. I have never been I California. How is the weather there in July? What kind of clothes would you recommend taking with me? Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I prefer to take traveller queckes? I am glad to hear from you. Yours faithfully Artemis  [SEP]  Hi Kim, How are you doing? I couldn't write  you because I was very busy. Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my town. I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hopped to see a lot of diffrent people. You know everybody has to cross this spot! Given the circumstances they asked my for helping in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out as a funny and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal. It means I had to read the recipies very carefully. And I had to controll that nothing will be missed. The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks. On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored. The people were all really funny and we were a good team. The time was quickly over and it was a great experience. And what about you? I am interested to hear about your new dog? Warm whishes Your friend, Artemis ",26.0
