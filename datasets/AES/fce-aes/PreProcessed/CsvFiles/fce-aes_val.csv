347," Dear Sir/Madam, I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' but found it very disappointing. It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement. However, there was a different unknown actor in that. The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in '19.30' as shown. There was no discount at all which is in contrast with 'Discounts Availabe'. After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason. The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement. I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back. Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts. Thank you for your attention. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? It is a very hard thing to predict. The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing. Although some may appears again after  few years different styles are developed. For the fashion of the future, I think it depends on the people's own personalities and  develope their own styles which suits them the most. They can wear different kinds of clothing, like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries. For the colours, I think the metalic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular. As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen. Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday. They can be thrown away after wearing it and  light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change  your wearing. ",23.0
82," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing with reference to the international arts festival that you organise every year. I would like to express my opinion about it and give you some suggestions that may prove to be useful. First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also refers to the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time. On the other hand, I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made. Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform. Actually, they came from only six countries. What is more, some concert halls were too small. As a result, it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there. Finally, I suggest you should think about giving the audience the opportunity to see more plays and films. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kathy, I'm really happy to hear from you again. I'm sorry for not writing earlier. Unfortunately, I'm quite busy so don't worry if I happen to delay  answer to some of your letters. In your last letter you wondered what the rules of behaviour at school and at home are like in my country, so I'm going to give you some information. In Poland rules that refer to the ways of being dressed at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. We are supposed not to be late for the lessons and, of course, students mustn't smoke at school. At home young people should help their parents do some houseworks. Generally, we are supposed to treat our parents (as well as the teachers at school) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters. What I'd like to change at school is that the breaks are too short! Give my regards to your family, ",35.00
36," Dear Ms Clark, I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me -  dances shows were absolutelly wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dances shows.  Dancers worn nice clothes,  the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefere them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so it needs more room. I like listening to the classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was exciting about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all  plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably  ticket for all  evants because we could change our planes during the evant. I suggest to organize  next IAF in the summer. We are both students so we have our holiday from July to September. We have more free time in the summer. We're going to attend  IAF any time, as well. Thank you for an unusual event Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Monte, I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. At first - we have to be at time. Our lessons start at 8 a.m and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear the school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most of studenst wear jeans and  sweaters. We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school-bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. It is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we have good marks at school they let us to go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary. We aren't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol. We aren't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers It is also horrible. We musn't talk to them but  only listen to them. I'd like to change it. Student's life is hard but sometimes funny. Love ",30.00
501," Dear Sir I am writing to complain about a terrible performance in your theatre. I had expected to see the fantastic musical show. However, everything was not performed as you had advertised. Firstly, there was a different actor/actress who I have never heard their name before. Even though they performed their parts excellently I was very disappointed about your incorrect advertisement. Secondly, the musical was not started on time. It was going to start  19.30. However, It was started 45 minutes later. Afterall, I lost my find return train after  show. thirdly, there was no discount about my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired. Finally. It was  perfectly terrible evening out. So, I want you to give my money back to me. If you don't do that, I will tell  public what you are wrong in your advertisement. Your sincerely. Yeung  [SEP]  When I was a yong child, I used to be interested in reading a scientific fiction. Interestingly, nowadays, I live in the scientific world which I read  in the book. Probably, I started useing  mobile-phone 5 years ago. Before using  mobile-phone, if someone wanted to talk to me immediately, they couldn't find me where I was. However, nowadays, it is easy to find me because of  mobile-phone. I used to write a letter to my friends. However, After  appearing   Internet, I've sent e-mail to my friends. It takes just a few minutes to send e-mail to some one. I just check my e-mail before going to bed everyday. In conclusion, Because of modern technology, I'm very comfortable and  do something effectively with  computer and mobile phone. ",30.0
1091," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you concerning our three days which we are going to spend in London. I would like to thank you for the programme which you have organised for our English class. It sounds very promissing. Especially the trip to Greenwich. But there is something else which we would like to see. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we all would like to go there. It would be a great opportunity for us, because we are all interested in fashion particularly in sports wear. The show is going to be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March from 10.00-19.00.. The entry for students is free. I would suggest to visit the Science Museum, which was planned for Tuesday, on Wednesday afternoon. So that we can go to the Fashion Show. And if there is anybody who wants to go shopping, he would be able to do it on Wednesday evening. We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. For just one day in my summer holidays I planned to do something adventurous. The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders, I knew, I had to see it. But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive. My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert. One man came out from a small building. It was our pilot. He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane. The doors of the plane were so thin, that I thought I could torne them. We went inside and the plane took off. It was horrible. I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or winds. I thought we would die. But then, finally, we reached the Grand Canyon. I didn't know what to feel. It was amazing. We were so near that, I thought I could touch the sides of the Grand Canyon by reaching out of the planes window. I swore to myself, I would never ever take a plane like this again. It was too dangerous, but I knew deep inside I had to see it. ",35.00

[SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Now let's start whith shopping at  Beverley Center.  Beverley Center area is the place that the teenager like to go shopping  the most. But some teenager like to go to Bolton-Market. Because every one have different thinking like beverley center if you  there every day or every week for a shopping you well get very boring because some time  is to much people every where like in the resturant and shops. It's make you feel  want to go home. And about the traffic some times it makes you feel  don't want to go out because of the traffic. And if you never know money or you have less money shopping is not enjoyable for you I'am choue. And shopping in the market is one think that I' am not going to do. Because all the smell in the market is alfrell   is the smell of the meat and durty water black and smely water all over the market street. I think of it it's make my shopping enjoyable. And that's why some time shopping is enjoyable. Because  the place and people. ,19.0
443," 17 June 2000. Dear Sir and Madam I am recently spending a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain with  couple of things. First, I  like to complain about the main features which is an actor, he might have been well known in England, but on the night, he performed abysmally. Secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time, because all of us at least have to wait for almost an hour until the show start. Also, a lot of people were enitieising about the facilities which said to be serve in an advertisement. For example, the discount for the tickets were not available, and especially a lot of people were disappointed that they can not visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgotten to clean up the mess from the previous party. Lastly, I think I could not call this as my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as a Manager of London's newest theatre, you would handle the situation favourbly. Yours faithfully. Seung Phittikhun.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, although he's one of my best friend, but sometimes, he's a real pain in a butt. Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I always got on very well. We always go to the same school, and he's often make more friends than I do, and everytime he's always introduce them to me. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secreats for anyone, even himself. Although, we are great friends, but sometimes people can make such a stupid mistake, and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight, it all started when once I accidently, took the wrong bag back to my house, and there was lady's knickers inside, I was so nervous and embarassing, so I tell Pat and there he goes, he tell every single students in the school that I've stolen  girl knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert. So that's when we had a fight. Anyway Pat eventually apologized to me and we still being best mates as ever. ",30.0
676," Dear Helen Ryan I am shocked that I won first prize in this competition. It will be a great adventure to visit Camp California. I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July. The reason is that I am a full-time student on Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of  semester, which is in June. I hope that it is not a problem. I would like you to know that I prefer a tent. I think it is much better than a log cabin. Aspecially in the summer when  tempereture and humidity are very high. From the list of all  activities I have choosen photography and golf. Since secondary school I am very interested in taking pictures and I have a big experience in it. I have choosen golf because I have never played in this game. Please, send me any information of what should I take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely Rafael Szymanski  [SEP]  Dear Kim Thank you for your latest letter. It was really very nice. I know that you're waiting for any information about a concert. Here it comes... My friend offered me a job as a member of  techical staff on Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew. Our job was to prepare the scene. We've built it using ready metal and wodden parts. It was really big and impressive. Then we had to plug  all electric instruments, speakers, lights and microphones. I was working with a specialist who had to connect all  lights together to one computer and prepare a colorful show. It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure of working with professionalists. It was a hard and complicated job but we all had a lot of satisfaction during the concert. Even Mr. Sting came to us to thank  for our help. I hope that you liked my story. Send me your opinion about that. I wish to see your letter soon Rafael ",31.0
424," Dear Sir or Madam. I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see ""Over the Rainbow"", the musical show that was played at this moment. First of all, the actors mentionned in the advertisement were not those who played  the show. Not that I was very disappointed not to see the good actors! The, if the show had started on time, it could have been much better, but it started forty five minutes late, it is too much for me! Plus, it is mentionned, on your advertisement, that discounts were available, in fact, no discount were done to me, whereas I am a student and as a student I was allowed to have a discount but I paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discount for this show. Finally, I think that this evening was very far  to be perfect, and I ask you for my money,  I spent for this horrible evening in your theatre, back. I hope you will understand my disappointment and the reasons why I ask for my money back. Your Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technologies are part of our daily life, everything we do is simplified by these new technologies. It is faster with new technologies to go from one place to another, for example, we can us a car or public transports such as  trains or buses instead of walking or riding as  in the past. Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too, washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done, some specific machines are made to do this stuff, it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport, relaxing... New technologies allow us to work more efficiently, with computers, complex operations can be achieved in a close time and with the insurance that the result is correct.  Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves on what happens in live, or search for  special leisure with a quick result. Finally, new technologies help us to save our free time and to work more quickly and more efficiently. ",21.0
1166," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill I hope it won't be grave. However, I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful. the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is  Palace Hotel, to get there you must go to the centre of town, all  buses are going there, Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office. For the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us  life music and cattering. Due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes. Finally, to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk arround the old part of the city, if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Chairs are not only part of the forniture, they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols. Who could have invented such a useful item? In fact, nobody has got this clue, but it must have been the most clever person on earth! the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs, from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices. From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented. Some people use them in their work, others are wishing to get  one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement. Although  is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us. ",25.00
1173," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown isn't well and hope he'll get better soon. I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information. Your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange  a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students. As you already know we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining, then it will  a buffet and a disco. You don't need to dress up smartly but please, make sure that your students don't wear short or trainers. Regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim. It's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people. There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends. I hope I've answered all your questions but if you need anymore information, please let me know. I am looking forward to seeing you all soon. Best regards,  [SEP]  To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car. Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation. Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as  fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this. From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality  life for my daughter and myself. Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before. I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it! ",38.00
986," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote  me asking for my preferences about the Camp. About the information you needed, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, because of work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in  tents, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a boyscout and go against the routine. From the list of activities you sent me, I stay with the, from my point of view, most relaxing activities available: painting and photography. One of my hobbies is the photography, so I think I am rather good at it, but I will take painting only to learn, because I am not very talentive at it. I also would like to know if I have to take  money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location. Please reply  soon. Yours sincerely David Brian  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! A couple of months ago, I was told that Britney Spears was coming to perform in our city. When I knew this, I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepares the stage during the concert. I was really excited. The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle. And I didn't even got paid. But it was worthy. I found my reward when the concert finished. After been carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was eshausted. But when Britney came out of the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write  me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me. Bye. With love David Brian ",32.0
153," Dear Sir, or Madam, Your advertisement for the musical show, Over the rainbow, said it was London's newest and best musical show, I agree with that because it is a wonderfull show but, it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it. I was really excited, but it turned out to be a different actor and I thought that was quite disappointing. The show started at 20:15 when it actually should have started at 19:30. While I was waiting I thought I should inform myself about the discounts available, the shocking thing was there weren't any! On the advertisment it also said, you could visit our restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason. What I'm trying to say is that this wasn't my perfect evening out and that I should get at least some money back! Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As we know, Carla and Pat were good friends so Carlotta would tell Pat anything. This time she told Pat that she thought her dog, Churls, was going to die. Pat couldn't resist herself and told her brother Jacob, he was quite shocked about the news because, he missunderstood. He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it.' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles's house. There, Jacob aproaches to him slowly and tells him. ""Charles, you can't be with Carlotta anymore, she's evil."" Jacob whispers ""What, you're crazy."" Charles responds. ""She said she was going to kill you!"" Jacob shouts. ""I'll talk to her."" Charles exclaims. When Charles told Carlotta what he knew, Carlotta started crying. It was all a missunderstanding. They managed to sort everything out and Carlotta never had anymore secrets. ",32.0
1115," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for the programme which you have prepared for us. We really like the variety of our trip to London. The programme contains enjoyment and education, what is very esencial for young people. However, we would like to say, that recently the advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show has been seen by one of your English class student. The show will be about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. In our opinion, we should go to the show. Firstly, because we are keen on fashion. Secondaly, because we do not have to pay for the tickets. We have already orgonised our visit  new programme. The show is on tuesday and we could go to see the show in the afternoon, instead of  shopping. We think, that we may  shopping  next day, on wednesday, in our free time. We are looking foraward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  Students.  [SEP]  The Home of the Future The future is unexpectable and human beings are afriad of dangers, such as tornado or earthquake. Thinking about home like a place to live, is not already worth. We must think about home from other point of view. We need to make our home a place where we want to come back  after the work or school. It has to be  pleasure to be there for us. What we really need in the next millenium is love, that is what will keep all  family together and forever. Do we care about a new carpet or a fashionable furniture? No; I do not think so. Live is too short to think about the poscesives. The houses will change because of new technologe, what may make our live more comfortable. Everything will be faster. We will  used to that. What depends on us, is how  atmospher we will have in our houses. The home of the Future, for me, is a place of hapinest. We cannot  aware  future technologe, but we might still have some feelings to eachothers. ",27.00
949," Dear Mrs Ryan, I'm writing to give you the information you requested in your letter dated March, 31st, in which you informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has accepted my holidays on that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible. Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  log cabins. I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days. It's difficult for me to chose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball. I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport. I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy. I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional information. What type of clothes must I take? Is it necessary to take dressed cloth for any formal events? Must I take cash money or can I use the credit cards? Thank you in advance for your help. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your last letter. I can understand why you are impatient to hear about my experience at the concert last month. I have met our favourite singer, Celine Dion! She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert. We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed . Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert. And then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her  an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me! I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph. Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D. Let me know if you are going to come so that I  prepare the bedroom to put you up . Please, come! Best wishes, ",33.0

This summer, I am available on July because on Agust my family and I are going to go to Canada and on September I will go back at university. If there is no chance to go to California on July, I could wait untill next summer. About accommodation, I would like to  a long cabin because last year I had an accident and my back is enjure, so sleeping in a tent it would be painful for me. I play basketball at university and my level is quite good but  I am really enjoying is being a referee. Due to my back enjure, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit, it would be a good aidea to be a referee. I would like to swim everyday if  is able. Althoung swimming is so bored, it would be a good  help for curing my back. Could you please let me know where will I eate? if will there be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it? how many money  you think will I need for those two weeks? And please could you give me  details about how does the weather  like there and what type the clothes will I have to bringh? Looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerily  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was brilliant! I had the best month in my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard, I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys with funny people. My job was cleaning the ground after the concert; ""it was very dirty"". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course, I had not to pay for getting in. I felt in love with a beautiful girl ""Calen"", she is from Spain and was selling ""hot dogs"". She will come to Liverpool next week and I'll put her up. Probably she'll come with a friend  if you want you can enjoy us. Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've done a new friends and I know that in the concert there isn't any drunk just funny and wonderful people. I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help in ""Doctor Meesee"" that is the best concert in the world, I hope you will come there. You have to save up  money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..). Love ",29.0
1117," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing in the name of the whole class. First of al, I want to thank you for the interesting programme, which you already have organised. It is very good, especially the Sightseeing tour by bus. However, we have seen an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London. There we can see everything about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. The entrance for student is free. This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education. Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon. The shopping could be done after the river trip to Greenwich but only if we have enough time. I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Will the home of the future really look different? It's quite difficult to say, but of course there will be a change. For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home  with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern, especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom. in the future it could be that you don't have to prepare your breakfast by your own, perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone . In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table, tidying up the house,  doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners. The place to spend the night will still be the bed. The livingroom won't get any big changes although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult. In general we can say the huge change we already had, but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us? Let's have a surprise? ",32.00
792," Dear Mrs Ryan I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition. Now I can realize one of my dream. I can give you all the information that you need. I prefer to travel in July because it is the only month I can have two weeks holiday. For the accommodation I prefer to have a log cabin because I have some problems with my back and I need a bed to sleep in. I can do two activities during my stay at the camp. The first one I choose is swimming. I have a good level  in swimming and I have done some competitions last year which I have won. For the second activity I choose photography. I have take a photography course  the last two years so I am able to do some beautiful pictures. One question, I just want to know what kind of clothes do I take with me? And how many money do I need? I thank you in advance. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You want to hear about my experience in helping at a pop concert. You can't imagine how funny it was! You could do so many things because you received a free-pass which allowed you to go where you wanted and it was what I had prefer about this experience. I really enjoyed to serve the drinks to the pop-stars. You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were still in the sky. And you heard the concerts too. After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people were like pigs. But I was chatting and laughing with other workers. One more word! If you can have the chance to do it too, do it! It was a very positive experience. I didn't regret it and I want to do it again! Write  me soon. Love, ",28.0
469," Dear Sirs, I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow. On Saturday, June 5th, 2000 my wife and I wanted to spend a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical. When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as  mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones. After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated. So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink. To make the matters worse Danny Brook who was announced as one of the starring person in the musical was not acting this evening. You can imagine how disappointed we were especially  the acting of Danny Brook was the main reason for us  to see the musical. On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities. As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it wasn't a perfect evening out I would like to have 50% of the prize of the tickets back. I am looking forward to your promt reply. yours faithfully, Heine Bitz  [SEP]  What would we wear in 100 years time? Fashion will always be an interesting and important subject for all ages. Today the fashion industrie has a great importance in the commercial market. In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but the fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way. Firstly, the material of which clothes are made has  a wide range. There are the natural material on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produce more and more syntetical clothes, which relay on the production cost. In 100 years most of the clothes are made from syntetical material. Beyond  colours will play an important role in the next century for the fashion. Light and bright colours will be very common. Especially contrast will be attractiv. Furthermore the style of the clothes are going to be more crazy and individuell but there will be still enumerous clothes for the solid people. One balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable and colourful. The fashion industry will deliver a wide range of vararity in style, material and colour. There will be clothes for everyones tast. ",30.0
983," 20 Ibiza Road San Antonio 13/06/2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam: I'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition. First of all I'd like to thank you for the prize, I will enjoy it abosolutly. Your letter encloses an application  I have to fill  with some information for the travel. Well, as you demand, I  tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins, I'm going to be able only  this summer month because  my job responsabilities. Acording to the choice whether I prefer tends or log cabins, I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping the nearest to nature, if it's possible in front of a lake or a river, if you camping has one, so that I will be able to practise my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing. As well as this one I'll take painting, I'm very keen on art and I think I'm good at making portraits. Finally, I'd like to add some further questions: what kind of clothes do I have to bring?, Do I any kind?, and Would it be necessary to bring  money?, how much? Thank you very much, and I hope the information above would be sufficient. I look forward to hearing from you Your faithfully Jose Fernandez  [SEP]  ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than  others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners. It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering  the revenge that Heathcliff  swear,  cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but  the others character make him become thus. This revenge links the story  so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.

140," Dear sir, I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday. In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see. First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the brochure. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed. I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even if I had read on the brochure that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed. Thanks to you, I've had the most dreadful experience of my life. If you don't give me back my money I'll never go to your theatre again. Write back soon  [SEP]  As Modern technology is changing the world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it's causing. New technologies have affected people's way of living for ages, by offering them better tools  to survive I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about  Internet. I think that  Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard  Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net. I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I'm really astounded by its way  of changing my daily life. ",34.0
442," Mr. Manager: The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", wich really disapointed me. First of all, there were no diccounts avaible  as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich wasn't cheap at all. Then, I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started, I was really disapointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement. Finally, when the show finished, I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed for repairs. So, as you can see, it wasn't my perfect evening out at all that's why I demand you to send me my money back. Your really unsatisfied costomer  [SEP]  How has modern technology afected my daily life? Since the begining of human life, people have invented ways to make their life easier. That is not difference from now. We live sorrounded by inventions wich help as through the day. From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night, we constantly depends on these inventions to be able to make the things we have to do. That's why modern technology is so important in our daily life, because it helps to make our life easiest and to do what we have to do faster so then we can use better our time. ",27.0
1146," Dear Ms. Belinda Marriott, My name is Akihiro and I'm a member of an English club at West Isle College. I'm writing this letter to invite you to the event which I'm organizing for people who want to improve their English, as our teacher told me that you have come to live in our area. Our English club is not a very big one, with 14 students and a teacher. Most of the students are between 18 and 22 years old, but there are some elder , the eldest is 28 years old. We all love to learn English. At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech. You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice. I'm planning the event on 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you. After the event, I'd like to offer you a dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  I had never taken birthdays serious, both my own and  of others, until I had that really special day on my twenty-fourth birthday. I was born in May, which is the busiest month for school teachers in Japan. Unfortunately, both of my parents are teachers. In my childhood, they were always too busy to remember my birthday and I didn't remember my birthday either. When I was 23, I joined a NGO in Denmark and stared living with other members, most of who are from Europe. On that day, I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday. I had never had a birthday party before and I didn't expect much. The party was far beyound my expectation. 20 people from five different countries celebrated for me. I had never felt happier. I still often forget my birthday, but I will never forget that special one I had two years ago.  ",36.00
451," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain to you what the problems were at the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. On your announcement foil I read that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show there was a different actor: this is the first disappointing thing. The second problem was that the show should have started at 19:30; but it did not; it started at 20:15! On the announcement foil I read that we could have had some discounts, but it was not true. This is a very disappointing thing! Then your theatre restaurant after the show was closed because the staff were not there; so we could not visit it. I expected you to prepare ""our perfect evening out"" for us; but you did not for unknown reasons. So, now I ask you to send my money back, because I really did not enjoy that night. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Kim, her friend, used to go camping at Sunset Village every year, and that year Kim, asked Pat to come with her. She accepted. In the evening Pat and Kim used to walk along the beach and they used to stop and turn at the Main Rock, a very big rock. But one night, with the moon light, they felt encouraged to continue their walk. Pat was a little bit afraid, but Kim convinced her to follow her saying that she knew the street. But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming forward them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: ""Our secret!"" When they returned to Caan, their town, they promised to keep silence about that. But Pat, coming back hom, told her mother everything. That night Kim heard another scream and the day after she ran to Pat to tell her what she heard. But Kim, and no one else found Pat. ",29.0
709," Hellow! I'am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because this month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it. So your advice of going to a camp suits me very well. Answering on our first question about where would I prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because it is closer to nature and I like sleepping in sleepping bags (=BV bags). Now let me tell you about my sports preferances. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us went out from  water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am candidat to masters of sports in water polo. And only out of that reason, but also because I like water very much. Also I would like to have a t-shirt with your signature. Yours scinerly Fedor Gapon.  [SEP]  In our lyceum we have  listem of ""double lessons"". It means that every day exept Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for  hour and a half and it means  ""double lesson"". I think that is more convinient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts fourty five minutes. It is convinient, I mean ""double"" lessons because you have more time to understand  matherial what is givven  and because you have to prepare only four subjects for ""tomorrow"" and it is less then seven subjects. As a student of  economical form I think I should tell you about one day in  time table of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have such lessons English, Math, Economics and Phisics. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them. Especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists. Not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, Biology and Phisical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.

237," Dear manager, I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show which was OVER THE RAINBOW, however, I had a very disappointing evening. There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show on the advertisement and the ones it actually was. Firstly the starring on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors on the musical show. Secondly time starts at 19:30 on the leafet but it actually started at 20:15. Thirdly it said there were discounts available on the advertisement, however, there was not any at all. Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was colsed because your excuse of being used at that moment. It said on the leafet that your perfect evening out, while it was not  at all. I felt very disappointing after seeing the music show in your theatre. As I said the reasons above, I want to ask for  money back! I look forwards to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was so kind that the couldn't stop telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown After finishing that Pat left this room. Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart throbbing quickly. She went quietly downstair and closed the door as soon as she went into her room. At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind which seemed as  just happened yesterday. ""Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?"" She said to herself ""I am just a servant in this castle, I loves him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle."" while it seemed as  a shadow came in from the window and disappeared quickly. Everything in the room is quiet except the sound of the clock as if everything is going to die. She was so frighten and sad that she had no energry. She fell down onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her. ",20.0
1001," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to answer to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in our competetion, which is two weeks , I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win. First of all I would like to tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because in the other months I will be too busy with my work. In the second place I add that I would prefer an accomodation in a tent, even though it is not very comfortable, because I want to put myself to the test by living in a condition I am not used to. Besides this, in connexion with the activities we will have the chance to do, I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both, especially at tennis. In addition to this I would like to ask you which kind of clothes and how much money it is necessary to have, since I am undecided about it not knowing the cost of life in California. I look forward to hearing from you soon, Yours Sincerely, Marino Rizzo  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time. Most of the students agree in saying that  two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together without the help of the teacher to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher. A little percentage, on the contrary, said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is explaining us something important, to give the idea of the real life in our classroom. which is the most.

1017," Dear Mr Robertson, The reason of my letter, is that our class would like to suggest a few changes on our programme of London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme. First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to  Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon. Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion, the show would be fantastic, we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to make up. It's a great opportunity to know more about fashion. Please, let us go to the show, for students are  free. I Look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than it is now. In the future, our homes will have the most advanced technologies. Computer will take a important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in the computer we would buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer. We won't have the necessity of going out from home, because  computer will give us everything. Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love ..., that kind of things will never change. In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life will approve, and  computer will be very important for us, but is won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of a home = have, that will be the same as now.

That disappointed both me and the people who just went to see him. And  the Times; the show had to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, there was said  to be discounts for the ticket but I saw nothing like this. All  people there gave the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day. I had a horrible evening, just the opposite of what I expected, so I want my money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  THE BIG FAULT Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was a big fault to gave her a secret, especially an important one. It all started two years ago. Rod was a happy man at that times. One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange man, who he ran after and  caught one of whom. Just then, the strange man took out his gun. Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself ,by his own gun. Nobody saw or nobody heard what had happened. Rod told this to nobody, except Pat, his best friend. One day, when they were arguing, Pat was very anxious and told what she knew to  police. Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison. He then was killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards. Rod's grave is now in prison. And these lines writes on his gravestone: Here lies the poor body of Rod, Never give your secrets away, This is why poor Rod died. And everyone was surprised. ",29.0

First, you asked abut the travel time and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holidays  in this period. Second, I prefer accommodation in  tent. I want to feel the real nature and spirit of Camp California. Further more, I should choose between two activities and  how good I am at each one. I choose singing and surfing, singing because I am a singer in a band and I hope to make my voice more perfect and surfing because I have never surf and I want to learn to. Finally, I have some questions. I would  know what type of clothes I should bring with me? How much money should I take with me? Is it possible to travel with a friend of mine? Yours sincerely Marlene Berg  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I hope  fine. Me, fine, because of helping at the concert  'The Dome'. I can say that this was one of the best experiences of my life.

Before and after the concert the ""stars"" are very hungry and I have serve them food, drinks and something like this. Kim, check it in your mind, I have had near contact with Mariah Carey! I am so happy about it. Different ""stars"" gave me signatures and talk really nice and normal with me. At the time the concert was running I cleaned the kitchen and the room where the ""stars"" ate. The after show dinner party was very nice and I have never thought that popular people like Elton John dances on the table if he likes the music and if he have made a great show on stage. It was just great and after this event I can say that popular people are normal humans like everyone ! Love, Marlene ",24.0

Actually this happened because the most things I saw were differend from what the advertisement had been written. First of all it had been written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring, but Danny wasn't there and somebody else took his place. This was the most disappointing thing I herd. Also you wrote that the show it was going to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. You ought to know that all the people hated to wait and started  the complains. The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open, because the owners were for holidays. At last you wrote that it was our perfect evening out, but like I said before it wasn't. Actually it was terrible and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to taking your answer Yours senciarly   [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After we had had an argument she told all the school my secrets. She had really let me down. I met her before a year and from the first time we talk to each other we became friends. It took us a few time to became best friend and after that we were always together. Every day after school she went to my house or I went to hers. Always we were laughing and having  great time. I loved her a lot and I thought she felt the same about me, but I had wrong. Anyway, always I trust her  my secrets, because I was sure she wouldn't tell them to other people, even if some say we would be apart. But I was wrong again. One day, we went to a party, where she met some of the most pobular girls in the school. She started to act like them and speak like them. When I told her, she became very angry. and she left without saying nothing. After when I saw her, she laught at me and the next day all the school knew everything about me. I started to cry but later I got over it Now the only thing I care  is that she couldn't keep secrets and all the school is looking down on me. ",24.0

In the advertisement of the show, you said it would begin at 19.30, actually it was 45 minutes delay. The discounts of tickets that you mentioned were not exist. It could make things worse that the visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of  lack of customers, was canceled. However, what a let down! I would be grateful if you could give  the money back. If I cannot get your satisfying reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life. Our life has been influenced by modern technology. Five years ago, you could be proud of your 486 computer, which can only be put inside a museum as an antique now. Then how does it changed our daily life? I have been an enthusiast of music for a long time, I used  tape player and I felt it was excellent. Today, there are multi-choices such as  discman (CD player). MD walkman and MP3 player, which are considered to be more portable and have  better timbre. Communication has been more conventional, we can simply make a phone call,  sent e-mails or faxes instead of writing letters and waiting for a long time. Especially the improvement  of personal computer has greatly helped the spread of information by using  internet, you can book newspaper, magazines,  even go shopping online. Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by  developing of technology. In conclusion, we should work hard to learn knowledges, making the future better and better. ",27.0
546," 13.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. You would like to have some further information from me. I am writing to answer your letter. I would like to travel only in July because I have been working in a bank and I can only go on a holiday in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in the tent. Therefore I would like to try some kind of experience. I am interested in tennis but I am not so good  tennis player. However I would like to attend tennis activity. In addition swimming would be  good activity for me. While I was studying at the high school and the university, I was in the swimming team of the school. I would like to ask you about clothes and the money. Could you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring? When I go there, can I use  credit card or should I have cash? I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true. For example me, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I hadn't liked it. However now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be ""yes, I like it"". When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go  some stores and try  new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on. They don't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves. Maybe they like shopping on  internet or window shopping  doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping style on the world I am sure everybody prefer one of them. In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there are always some fun you can find. You only need to discover what you like, and how you can have fun with shopping. ",25.0
985," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in order to give you some further information that you enquired for the Camp California. First of all, I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment. I am allowed to take holiday only in July. Concerning accommodation, I would prefer to stay in log cabins. Log cabins are bigger, more stable and usually more comfortable than tents. As requested, I have choosed two activities - sailing and surfing. I am quite experienced in surfing - I have participated  some competitions - whereas  not at all experienced in sailing. I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp. Also, I would like to know if there is going to be  qualified instructor for activities since I am a beginning in sailing as mentioned before. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Kan Seo  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? Thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you. I'm sorry I haven't written before, but as you know, I've been very busy because I was helping at a pop concert last month. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I helped people setting  and decorating the concert hall which was great help for my major subject - You know that my subject is design. I also had to distribute the flyers. What I particularly enjoyed was meeting the famous musicians I have been dreaming  to see. The day I shaked their hands, I though I was over the moon! I will never forget that day. Write son and let me know what you have been doing. Lots and lots of kisses, ",32.0
761," Dear Helen, I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to reply and ask you some questions. Firstly, I would be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, for the accomodation, I would say I prefer living in  tent rather than in  log cabin because I used to sleep in  tent while I was joining  a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have choosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would  ask you whether I have to prepare any speacial clothes for camping or the camp will provide them for me. I look forward to receiving the details of  travelling soon and  joining your camp in July. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but  also decrease the  money in my pocket. Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy. Keeping  balance between daily life and shopping life may give more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex. ",39.0

It is well know in almost all family,  often with a lot of different cannels. First of all, the TV can tell us news in a short time,  what happened all over the world. Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is, that they telling about interesting reports, for instance about animals or  different culture from other countrys. Furthermore they have a lot of different programme, usually something for everybody. It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work. Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can watching the weather  and all of them were present in wonderful colour. To sum up, in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention. However, they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children. I can not imagine to live without televison, it is something what we need for our education,  for getting news and other helpful information. ",26.00
119," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", that I went to see on the 16th of June. Firstly, the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook, but he was not, it was another actor, who I have never seen before, so, as you can imagen, I was very disappointed. Another complain is about the time that the musical show started, the advertisement said it started at 19:30, but it did not, we had to wait 45 minutes. It was terrible. Now, about the tickets, the were different prices but there were not discounts, and because of this, many people could not see the show, especially students. Finally, when the musical show finished, and I have to say, a bit late, I went to the theatre's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone. At  is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat, Maria's best friend Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him, in fact, she was so angry she  almost kill but, she couldn't because Pat was her best friend. Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did, but Pat refused to apologaising to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: help Maria to get the man that she loved. Maria was speechless, it was the first time that she didn't know what to do, so she decided to stop talking to Pat. After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school. Some  friends phoned her everyday, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved, despite that, she was not sad. One day, when Maria was seating in her bedroom, someone knock  the door, it was Manuel, he was worried for her. Maria was nervous, but for the first time, she could talk to him as she never did before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person of the world, she gave her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back, after all, everything happened because of her.

714," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter with reference to the competition. Here are the information you required. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I am free. Secondly, I prefer cabins. The main reason is that I love wood. In addition, due to my height (185 cm), I think cabins may be a better choice. Thirdly, from the activity list, I chose swimming and tennis as my favourite ones. Although I have played tennis only twice, I really enjoyed it. With contrast to this , I can swim when I was six. Furthermore, I once have been trained in a swimming centre, so I am quite confident with it. Lastly, could you please tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should prepare and do I have to buy insurance myself? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video from my school. In my opinion, maths, politics, chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English  and other foreigners are particularlly curious in. As far as I know, English people are really surprised about  Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as the knowledge in politics. This is a good oppertunate to see how they learn in class. As it is expected, painting lesson is an amazing one. You can find students use traditional chinese ink to draw and write. In spite of lessons, there are all kind of activities such as sports meeting, racing competition, and countryside activities. Some are held once a year and some are held every term. You will experience a different life in them. In conclusion, besides all  mentioned, I highly recommond you video  students' daily life and interview them. That will make it defenitely a successful video. ",26.0
353," Dear Sir, Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show. Firstly, I would like to tell you I had unfortunately a very bad evening. Indeed, I was very surprise to ear when I asked for a discount that it was not possible to have one. In spite of that, I finally decided to take one ticket. The other bad point was the time when the show started, it was already 20:15 when the first star entred on the scene, but your advertisement sayed 19.30! The worst was when the actors were presented to us and the starring names were completely different than I expected. Finaly, I didn't understand why you pushed people to visit your restaurant if you don't open it after the show! This is why for all of those good reasons I am asking for some money back. I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending of . I look forward to earing from you . Your faithfully.  [SEP]  Our century is a century of changes, of evolution. Since the end of the 40's which is the period where the technology started , nobody can say that nothing has changed. Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent of the technology. In fact our life style is based on the technology, now, if we want to stay at home without having contact with other people, we can do it, we just need a computer and a modem and that's it. If I want to discuss  with friends or order a Pizza, I can do it  easely as I want, when it want. In spite of that, I think the technology is improving my quality of life. A good example is the celular phone, I can contact my family without  problem, I can inform my company if I had an accident with my car. If I compare my life now with the life of my grand parents, I think both are comparable, I say that because without knowing  the technology, it's difficult to imagine a best life, in fact, you leave with your time. Even if the technology is important for my quality of life, I am not able to say if it will continue to be the case in 10 years. ",27.0
1067," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to you about the trip to London. All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have set, they are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year. So we can walk around and see how it looks like in Greenwich. All of us want to go to this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we all would like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m., it is about the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, all of us are really interesting, and it is free for student to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things in there. So may you please change the visit of the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was two years ago, me and my classmates went to a leadership trip in London. This trip was organised by our form tutor, he wanted to test us if we trust each other and worked in a team, and the trip last for 3 days. The first days was going fine, we just had to do some teamwork things. In the second day, we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and careful, and I climbed about 15 metres quite success, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right feet slipped over, I was nearly fell down, but luckly my hand caught a rock, it was dangerous, but I didn't had any choice, finally I did it. ",31.00
230," Dear the manager My name is Sally Smith. I went to see a musical show last Wednesday. I had a very disappointing evening. In the advertisement you said ""Danny Brook"" is the actor but it wasn't . It was somebody else. I went to see the show because I like Danny Brook. The person that played instead of Denny was not very good. The show supposted to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm. It was very late. We had to wait nearly an hour. Staff did not tell us why it started late. When I bought tickets, they did not discount at all. I asked them about discounts because I saw  in the advertisement. They ignored me. We bought tickets without  discount. I don't know that they   discount for somebody else or not. After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it  closed. It closed at 11 pm. It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm. The show finished late. The restaurant should  open until the show finish. It was not a perfect evening at all. Could I please have my money back? It was £60 for  tickets. I was very disappointed about this. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sinecerely Sally. Smith.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

If you want her to keep it secrets, do not tell her. She is not keeping secrets. This is her bad point. She always tells someone else about it. Last week, Tim told Pat about his serious problem. He wanted Pat to keep it between them but Pat did not keep his promise. She told us about it. When Tim found out that we knew his problem and  tried to help him. He was very angry with Pat. He wasn't talk to Pat at all. Basically, Tim did not know that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. She did not know when she can speak or not speak. We  so worry about her in the future. She has not a lot of friend because of this point. ",30.0
327," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow. My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook. We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor. The show should have started at half past seven but we had to wait for forty-five minutes without any kind of explanation. Not only was the show late and awful but it was expensive too. The advertisement said there were discounts available but when we arrived there the woman who sells the tickets told us the discounts were only available on Monday evenings. Despite the terrible evening we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to relax and have dinner, but we found it was closed because its floor was being repaired. As you can see it wasn't a perfect evening at all! That is why I am writing to you. I want you to give  our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true. There should be no problem as I still have the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you.

I'm writing to you now because I've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christie. It will be the following Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening. It's a story titled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it. The story is about the life in a small village. The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman. That woman is supposed to have killed her husbands (at least two), because she wanted their money. The policeman lets her know he has discovered her and he won't allow another crime. He threatens to tell her husband what she had done. However, she's a very clever woman and she doesn't look worried. In the end, the three of them are having a cup of coffee and one of the cups contains a terrible poison. There will be a horrible accident in a few seconds. Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends. Drop me a line and let me know what do you make of the story. Best wishes, ",35.0

Thanks very much for letting me use your things during the stay. I may need to use particularly the computer and the CD player. Is that OK for you?

I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in the emergency situations and I am quite reliable too. Obviously a sailing trip has not got the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting. I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real life and having friends from all over the world will help me to think ""worldwide"". I hope this letter will be enough to explain why I want to do this trip. Yours sincerely ",34.00

202," Dear Mr. Smith, During my last holiday in London, I was visiting your theatre in order to see ""Over the rainbow"". You wrote some things in your advertisement and I was disappointed that  wasn't true. First you have written that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the real actors were different. It was a disappointing for me, because this actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina. You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour. It wouldn't be mind if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and it hadn't also opened after the show, because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room. Over these the tickets were not discount available as you have written  in your advertisement. So it wasn't a perfect evening for me and I think about it, if I can have my money back. If it's possible, please write back. Sencerely ...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his hole schoole knew from Sara's experience. Sara was a very good puple.

156," 17/06/00 Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw at your theatre two weeks ago; as a matter of fact our evening turned out to be very disappointing. First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook, but sadly he wasn't there, he was filled in by a different actor, who was instead rather disappointing. Furthermore the show should have started at 19.30 but instead it began at 20:15 which was really unpleasant. At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this wasn't possible, instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available! At the end of the show I was so tired that I decided to eat something at your restaurant, but surprisingly it was closed due to some unreasonable technical problems! The advertisment assured us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate  if you could refund completely our tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets: he always wanted to know everything about everybody and after, of course, he would give away all he knew, but one day he had some problems... His best friend Paul couldn't put up anymore with Pat always revealing his secrets, so  decided to play a trick on him. Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new misterious lover. Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially to the press. Pat obviously couldn't help being silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the story! On Sunday all the english press was waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all an invention, they got so angry that they wrote on every newspaper that Pat had made up everything!

Yours sincerely, Sofia Jordana  [SEP]  It is Saturday. The car park of the supermarket is full. No more trolleys for shopping. All the shops are crowded. Some people are in a hurry other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed. It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults. We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell. In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable especially when there is too many people in there. ",33.0
136," Dear Sir/Madam, I was to  Circle Theatre to watch  'Over the rainbow' musical show, recently. I was trully dissapointed by it. My expectations were high after I've read your leaflet in which it was advertised as 'London's newest and best musical show'. Now, I can assure you it wasn't. Firstly, it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star. The substitute was far worse. Secondly, I had to wait fourty-five minutes before the show finally began. Another unkept promise are the discounts. There weren't any! Lastly, when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant is closed. You can believe me it wasn't 'my perfect evening out' and I have no other choice than asking  to give  my money back. I paid for something I didn't get so it is obvious that I want my money back. I got the £15 ticket. I'd like you to send the money to this adress; ul Taklowa 10 Skoclow 43-430 POLAND Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days the whole school knew. When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh. Paul couldn't stand it. He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind. He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do. Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him. They were no longer friends. 'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'. As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him. He turned around and saw... Jean. 'What are you dong here, why aren't you at school?' she asked. Paul was like paralyzed. He couldn't reply. 'I had heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'. Paul couldn't believe his ears. While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school. When they entered everyone became silent. All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat isn't that bad at all. ",30.0
758," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you wanted. Firstly, you asked me about the period I'd prefer to travel: For me, the only solution is July, because I've already something planned in August. Concerning the accommodation, I'd prefer to spend my nights in a log cabin, because I've great difficulty sleeping in a tent. You also mentionned the activities I'll be able to do. I chose tennis and golf. Althoug I've been playing tennis for five years, I can't say I'm a very good player. And I'm even worse at golf, because I've never been playing it before. But I enjoy discovering  new activities! In addition to this, I would be grateful if you could send me  information on these few details: what kind of clothes is required? How is the weather at this period of the year? And should I take some money with me? How much? I hope you will be able to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely Hermine Damien  [SEP]  ""Cry Freedom"" If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", from John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice? Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries. However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage,  love of justice,  fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them. To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story. ",36.0
760," Dear Madam, First, I would like to thank you for offering me this wonderful prize. For a long time I wish I came to Camp California, and now my dream is about to become true. There is no much time left in my timetable in August since I will have to work then, so I would rather come in July. Concerning the accomodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather... Since this stay at Camp California is a good occasion to discover new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner in both activities. Then, I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need there, and if I have to bring a lot of money. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Richard Amelin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably now, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert. What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons. The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: ""You know. I already know them, I have even helped them at one of their concert."" Moreover, the work I've had to do, apart from carrying material, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them. Even though my entire body aches ( material was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it a work! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Richard Amelin ",31.0
1236," Dear Mrs Smith: My name is Juniper, I am helping to organise the conference in the college. I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions. The group has been booked into  Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held. You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference, it only takes ten minutes approximately. As for the end-of-conference party, it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9:00. All the students and staffs will join together in the hall. They can play games and talk about  personal experience. The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world. So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart. I have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you. If you are free I will show you arround our college. You can visit our newly-built science lab as well. I'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Best wishes.  [SEP]  Best choice Welcome to London. You asked me for an interesting building to visit. In my opinion, I'll recommend  British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there. The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge white round building which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library before! The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson! Apart from the national history, there are more content about the past of the world. You can go to many sections such as  Asia Hall, Egypt Hall, Europe Hall and so on. Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate. After a visit to  British Museum, you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away! Also you don't have to pay any money for it, and the transport is extremely convenient, therefore  British Museum is your best choice. Don't be hesitant any more! ",34.00
561," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am really surprised about the free journey to California, because I've never ever won anything before. My summer holidays last for two months, but I just have time in July. In August I am going to work in an office, so there is not possibility  to travel away this month. I would prefer the accommodation in a log cabin. For one night it would not disturb me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable. At the Camp I would like to go sailing a lot. Once my family and I went to Greece and rent a sailing boat for three weeks. Because most of the work did my parents, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat. As the second activity I have chosen to make photos. I'm used to be the photographer at the holidays with my family and I know how a camera works. Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and how much money I should estimately take with me. I just want to know, what I will have to pay  alone. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to discover a new type of landscape! Yours  [SEP]  The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found  you should take everything you like and go into the cabin. It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity. After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly. At the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are all the work worth. ",28.0
171," London, June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir, Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, like its advertisement tell us. Unfortunately, I had a terrible evening. At first I became worried because there wasn't any discounts available, like your advertisement say . And I became even more angry  to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin. It's necessary to start on time, and your paper was informing  that it would begin at 19:30. It didn't happen. To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I've never heard anything from, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do. I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money for a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a shame. I'm looking forward to your answer. Cordially,  [SEP]  Secrets between friends Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And because of that, everyone at school happened to know that Ali was dating Nick, that used to be Caroline's boyfriend at the time. Pat was Ali's best friend, and because of that, Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline's boyfriend, but asked her to keep the secret. One week later, everyone at school started to laugh at Caroline and look down on Ali and Nick. Caroline discovered everything, and argued with the infidel couple. It was a big quarrel, people that were many meters distant could hear it. Pat entered the fight, and it became more loud and agressive. One more week has passed, and things became calm: Ali decided to never look Pat on the fact anymore. They have turned themselves into big enemies. And Nick told her that his real love was his girlfriend Caroline, and that they weren't going to break up. Poor Ali.. So, it's very important to be a person than can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship. Then, we have to be as best secret keepers as possible, or we will end  like Ali and Pat. ",25.0
383," Dear Sir or madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"" that was advertised in this week's newspaper. According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring  but it was a different actor. It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time. It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it was not. It started fourty five minutes later. And if this were not enough, I had no discount in the ticket  as was written. Beside this, we where invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why  you make this invitation? On top of everything, I am on holidays and you can imagine how disappointed I am. It was not a perfect evening out. I suppose that you are understanding my situation, because you did not say the truth. I believe that you will be direct to blame and give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Caesara Rodrigos Los Arnos  [SEP]  Nowadays the modern technology is increasing and it was really affecting our daily life. Sometimes there  advantages but there  some disadvantages too. Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster. Beside this you can talk with a person in the other side of the world by a computer. It is interesting! Furthermore it helps in house works, at school and you can travel to places very quickly. So the main advantage of the modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier. On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems to our health. A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy. They have everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future. To sum up, there are both positives and negatives aspects of the modern technology, because it can makes our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us. ",26.0
351," Dear Sir/Madam, Last night I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"", and I have to say that I had a very disappointing evening, even though I heard that the show was exciting. Two days before I read the advertisment for this show, where  Danny Brook was starring. Unfortunately last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing. Apart from that the show started at 20:15 not at 19:30, as it is written in the advertisment and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished. I am in London for a week and I had to say that last evening I had an awful time, so I want some of my money back. I am looking forward to receive your reply with my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I had been friends for a long time and as my best friend he knew all my secrets. Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother want to talk  me for something, so I went in her bedroom to speak with her. She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went in a party without asked her and that she had to punish me for that. She told me that I had to stay at home for that weekend and not to go out with my friends. When I went in my bedroom I reliased that Pat had told my mother for the party, because noone else knew that my mother did not know that  I called him and we had a big argument. Pat is not a reliable person so he is not my best friend anymore. ",25.0
837," Dear Sir or Madam I have just received your letter. I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply for the camp. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have to return to my University in the middle of August. Your another consideration was accommodation. I think it is more comfortable to stay in log cabins than in tents, so I would prefer log cabins. According to your letter, I can choose two activities to do at the Camp. I would like to choose painting which I have been doing for 12 years and tennis. However, I am not very good at playing tennis, so could you tell me if I can learn at the camp? Please could you also let me know if I need to take special clothes with me? I would be grateful if you  phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience. I look forward to the camp in the U.S.A. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Cry Freedom 'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them. In the first part of this book it can be seen  Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa. Although Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world. In short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again. Most of all, this book will make you think about the prejudice you have. ",37.0

219," Dear Sir or Madam I am writting to complain about I am really disappointed  your musical show which is ""over the rainbow"". on last week. I could compare between the advertising of  musical and  actual musical show last week. First of all, the advertising shown us starring, which is Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, however, when I had seem it, starring of  musical completely diffarent actors, I  really disappointed about it. Secondary, the advertising shows as the musical start  14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started  20:15, it's 45 minuts late, and also, I'd asked  discount ticket in the ticket counter, but there are not available any discount tickets. Finally, your theatre restaurant was closed after  show, it is because I saw it was opened at break time for musical, but afterwards, the people of staff for restaurant were closing. Now then, how was this advertising, it was completely diffarent, I am really disappointed  your musical, I am ask you for  money back, because I wasn't enjoyed your musical. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your Faithfully, from  [SEP]  I am writting  composition about ""How has modern technology changed your daily life"", this is our question. All at the technology developed about every day, not all of them, but still a lot of modern technology changed our daily life. First of all, I thought more than half  population of British has  ""mobile phone"", it is small and compact, much lighter than  home telephone, and one of the biggest advantage is you can carry it, so that   easy to contact your friend or someone who other, even they can easy to contact you as well, so you can phone anytime you wants, whenever you wants. Secondary, Personal Computer (PC), these ""Desk Top"" and ""Lap Top"" computers developed each year, however,  most important thing is  ""Internet"", Mobile phone could easy to contact anyone in your country,  ""Internet""  easy to contact  world wide, you can send E-mail anytime, anywhere you wants, it is  most popular thing  all of the world.

253," Monday, the 5th of June 2000 To the Circle Theatre's manager Dear Mister, I recently had the opportunity to see ""over the rainbow"" which was played last week in the Circle theatre. I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I spent there. Actually, I read the advertisment for the show and there were a few mistakes on it. In fact, Danny Brook didn't play or appear on stage last Tuesday, the role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook. I'm also sorry because I had to wait 45 mn before the pieces started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we were students) and no discount was proposed or made for us. We had to pay £15 each for seeing a miserable pieces. After the piece, we waned to eat at the theater restaurant but we couldn't. It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why. As you can see, there are some (volontary?) mistakes on the advertisment you made. We didn't have a ""perfect evening out"" at all. That's why I'm asking you for giving us  money back. I'm sure we'll find a compromise and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  An unusual part of life. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and half a week later, all the school knew about me. I had a strange feeling then because it was just amazing to notice how money can attract so much people. I started to have a lot of new friends, they all wanted to be my best friend. Actually, my best friend would still remain Pat, even if he failed me. It's not easy to keep such an enormous secret and I couldn't keep it inside of me. I became quickly bored by this hypocrital attention they had for me. They didn't stop giving me advice or telling me what to do with my money. I always has been involved in many differents associations, which are fighting against AIDS or cancer. I knew at this moment what to do exactly and finally, I could refind my ordinary life as an unpopular student. ",35.0
365," Dear Sir or Madam, Last week I spent my holiday in London and I've seen your musical ""Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed. When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems. The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15. The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none. Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of  holiday. Why do you give those information in an advertisment. For me it was really not a perfect evening, I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible. Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for a compensation, maybe to get my money back. I hope you understand my complains. I wish you answer me soon. Yours sincerely Sandra Eichmann  [SEP]  In my opinion the modern technology has changed my daily life not really a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play   computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine. I grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the  development in the technology is not very big. Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet. It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything. You don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food. I can just switch on my computer and order everything. I also don't write letters anymore because I write e-mails to my friends. That goes quicker and it is easier for me. But I think in my generation it is not a really big difference. In comparison to my grandparents they have really problems to accept these changes in modern technology. Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years. ",30.0

Because I  aware of  big lines to  check point, crowds of people, noise... And of'course not all shops have good conditionering. In my opinion the better time for shoping is weekdays, preferably in the morning. Otherwise, you either will not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in  bad mood, because of  bad maners of sales people, that not every time you ask can give you any advice.

I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert . But after this serville work I met Eminem. I think you know his popular songs like ""My Name Is"". It was one of the greatest moments in my life. I had to bring him something to eat. It was a hard but also a funny work. You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. ",30.0
330,"  Dear manager, I am writing to tell you that I stayed very disappointed with the theatre. One of my reasons  to travel to London, was this theatre. I knew that ""Over the rainbow"" was horrible! I thought that it was the best musical show that London had. I was wrong, very wrong. In the propaganda  had written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are supposed to be the actors, and in the theatre  had totally differents actors. I bought my tickets fuee days before the theatre thinking I will have  discounts. But it happenned the opposite. I payed the same as  who bought the tickets ten minutes before the theatre. Other thing I have to complement is about the time of the theatre. It was supposed to starts at half past seven, and it started only at fifteen  past eight. After all this, I want to know if I will have some money back. I hope so. yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It is true that science and technology affects our lives a lot. The technology is essencial to our life, we need it on each minute, on each second. It is rare the schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use. But it is good and bad in the same time. Good because you can have acess to a lot of informations, and it is bad because the computers are getting the people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who have the certain  that the computers will not get the place of the teachers? It is interesting to starts to think about this point. Another point is that the television is taking the childhood of the children. For example, our parents had time to played with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only shows silly programmes. We need this technology, but we have to know how to control this. ",24.0
1043," To Mr. Robertson I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London. I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking  and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum. This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down. I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on. I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time. Please give this your careful consideration.. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In a country like the UK, we are all bound to have houses. We either own it, or we simply borrow it from other people. We take our homes for granted. Think about the people in the poor countries! They struggle to survive. However, as we approach the future, our homes will start to change. Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives? I doubt it. There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homes might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and  risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery. The future homes will also have many similarities, such as having a separate bathroom, and not having one in a bedroom, or having two floors or having garages. It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. What do you think will happen in the future? ",32.00
963," Dear Sir/Madam Thank you for your lovely letter? I was really surprise to heared I have won in your competition. With pleasure I'll give all  information wich you need. I would like to book my tickets from the beginning of July. The 3rd of July will suit to me. As far as I know accomodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I prefer log cabins. It's more convinient for me. I am very glad I can chose two activities while I will at the Camp. I am keen on basketball, I played in my country for 7 years. I am  good diffender. I would like to choose surfing like my second activities. I've never done it before. I'd like to get some lessons if it's possible. I've seen how people do it but I've never tried it my own. I'd like to know what temperature  in July in California and youre advice about how much money I will need to have an unforgetable hollydays! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable, is it? We can't say that  is always enjoyable or  is not. Every new day is not the same. But... I think that good shopping depends on ourself. If we decided to by somthing special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it. Probably, maybe not. Some times we have to have deal with not good service or for example could you imagine it on your way to  shop you have met wrong people or someone told you bad news. Or  quality of your new thing is not so good that you really expected. Situations are variously. Maybe you will spend all your money for a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to  night-club but you are short of money. Some people will do crazy things in  situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party. But I want to wish you have a good enjoyable shopping all your way. ",25.0
20," 16 December 2000 Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an excellent organisation of an annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows. However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Besides, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones. As a matter of fact, I consider one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events to be brilliant as it offers a unique opportunity to pay for everything all together and be able to attend different events. I believe your festival to be a great event in our cultural life and I am convinced that it is a success. I look forward to coming to the festival again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë For a start I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook,  they make us feel and think. As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and  people around us. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of  everyday's routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters,  reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses  irresistable fascination. To draw the conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastic stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves. ",38.00
404," To Manager. My name is Sam. I would like to inform you that your advertisement mentions so many different things, so it spoilt a part of my journey. Then I want to receive my money for the ticket. After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote 'discouts available' but they didn't  discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired. You advertised for my perfect evening out. But I was unpleasent because of these things. So I ask you to return some money back. If you have something to ask, please call me. I will stay until the end of this month. The number is 577-6277. (Hotel number). I wait to hear from you soon.  [SEP]  I think there is nothing not to be influenced by science and technology affects in our daily life nowadays. I would like to answer how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife. I have much housework to be done from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric products; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juice, fridge. I think I can have my spare time owing to these thing. For example if I don't have  washing machine, I will have to wash all  clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. During the washing machine is whirring, I can get my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without  car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them. Owing to all of them, I can live very comfortbly. These things provide me  all convenience. ",26.0
173," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a number of points. I went to London on holiday and to The Circle Theatre to see Over The Rainbow. Although, this musical show was not as good as I expected. First of all, was the show suppossed to start at 19.30, but it started first at 20.15. To make matters worse, instead of Danny Brook performing you had another actor, which was very disappointing. Secondly, it says in your advertisement that discounts would be available, despite the fact they were not. On top of everything, you recommended to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. however this was closed due to lack of personall. According to your brochure it says this would be the perfect evening out. According to my experience it was not. I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Carley Agda Nilsen  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Designers are improving their skills all the time. Nowadays, there are more and more people who wants to become designers and the competion is increasing. Everybody wants to be the best. Due to this the quality of clothes is getting better and in 100 years we will be asking for a bigger variety of clothes. Although, the price of clothes is increasing, people still buy them. We give other things priority so we are able to afford our clothes. On the whole, people nowadays, do care more about their appearance and will be continuing to do . It appears that people are more aware about clothes and also work. I think people in the future will begin to only wear fashionable clothes. If you feel nice, in an outfit your confident will be likely to increase and this might also help you to get a better career in your work, something which is very important today. ",37.0
1137," Dear Mr. Robertson. I am writing on our class behalf to thank you for organising our tour in London. Our class is very appritiate you for the good programme. Especially, we are interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich at the afternoon. It is a good idea to include the visiting of the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery at  morning time on Tuesday and Wednesday respectivelly. However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show. It is a great opportunity because of the following reasons. Firstly, there will be leisur and sports wear and the latest fasions. Secondly, there will be exibitions about makeup and hair styles. Moreover, the entrance for students is free. We suggest changing our programme a little bit. Instead of Wednesday's afternoon free time we could visit the Science Museum. And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fasion and Leisure Show till 19.00. After all we will be able go shopping. I am looking forward to recieving your positive reply. For the further details you can contact me my phone number. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Famous people. What does it means? From my point of view, these are the people, who stay all  time in our sigh. We  intrsted in politicians's and film stars's wear, hobbys, passions and the intrigues. The lardge numbers of the journalists following them all the time, even in there private life. In my opinion, each human being has  rights to be free. We can go for a wolk, go shopping go to the cinema,  marrige or devorce. Why famous people couldn't do all this things? Why everybody must know and tolk about their private life? The most important thing  that the famous people are also normal people as us. They live as us, they brief and eat as us, they even following in love as us. I think, they must have a normal, private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them  in the different newspaper's curiouses. ",21.00
634," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize. It is the first time I won a prize! As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area. It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team, since I used to play it in my school's team and I think I'm pretty good at it. Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport. I'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money. I have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Carlitos Andrade  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay. However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family. Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. Its normal to have spending sprees. Everyone  had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid. Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date. In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time. On the other hand, if you think that you'll be on the red, I'd better stay at home. ",33.0

258," Dear Manager, My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, wich took place in your stablishment, The Circle Theater, that made me feel very upset. First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very exited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began. I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne, the show must begin on time, but it started forty five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seeing before, and the restaurant was closed with no advise. At last, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible. Yours Sincerelly,  [SEP]  In our days, technology has become a very common thing, even among children. It is such an evolution for  human race, however we can not forget that it can cause some problems too. Firstly, the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade, with the devellopment of telephones, radio stations, television and even satelites, and of course, the internet, gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this provided health and education researches to increase as well. In the other hand, technology has made the differences between - poor and rich people to grow at a high level, and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries. I addition to that, people will always be affraid of the technological war. In conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a  new area to explore, we have to use it with a great amount of responsability, for us all to survive in the future.

1152," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference. As you need more information, I answer all your questions with plesuare. Firstly, the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from  main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot. Secondly, our end-of-conference party is included dinner and dancing, I would advise you to wear something not very formal. Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places (castles, builded in  13-th century) or art gallery, as well as  beatiful Bodnant garden. I am looking forward to the meeting with you and  mutual work during conference. Your sincerely  [SEP]  There are many different people's inventions around us. We are so used to them, that sometimes  think they existed always. Some of them are very practical, other are rather strange. I thing, that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone. Imagine life without  phone. You are on the road, you have  car accident. What are you going to do without  phone? On another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure, the phone has saved many lifes. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only for chating in any time. Thanks  the phone, it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth. To be honest,  next great invention of people,  computer, can't work, if you haven't got the phone. So I am very grateful to  man, who invented it, unfornutely, I have forgotten his name. It always happens with people, doesn't ? Try to ask who invented the will or the book. ",28.00
964," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your requests. First of all, it would be suitable for me to travel in July only, because that is when I am on holiday from work. Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be unapropriate for me. I would prefer golf and surfing. I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent to do so. About surfing, I am an amateur at it. I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships. Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take. I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there. Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerately,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert. It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began. What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him. Bye! see you soon, ",33.0
179," Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" I am writing to  with the intention  to give you an impression of our experiences visiting the above mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apologation. We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that ""perfect evening out"". We would like to ask you if there is any chance  to get our money back of or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.  [SEP]  ""The old man and the Sea"" Dear Tim, I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II  always on the search for answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"". I hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know! I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards M. S. ",36.0
1007," Dear John! I was very happy to receive your letter. I haven't heard from you for a long time, how are you? How is your sister, Marine? I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable. We were also very lucky with the weather, it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long. I think you should definetly go and I'll try to help in what I can. First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions. I think you should take  packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle). I advise you to try  watersports as well, it's a real laugh. I'm not sure how many students are there in your class but they give reductions for groups  over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you. By the way, I'd love to come with you, if it's possible! I really enjoyed our trip and I'm eager to see you again! Looking forward to your reply, Love  [SEP]  TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day, unable to press the ""Off"" button on the remote control. Some say it's evil, it spoils our eyes and personality, others say it's useful, enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality. But can each one of these people answer one simple question! ""Could you live without television for a week?"" I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived  three weeks in a complete TV vacuum, I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings. You might ask me a normal question ""What about  news?"" Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers? And the radio (if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them to be read to you!) The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say ""no"" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more. ",40.00
726," 13, June, 2000 To Helen Ryan, Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you for the letter. I got it today and couldn't believe it! As you asked me for some further information. I will write it down. I'd like to travel in July and this is the only time I can travel, because I am busy with a school project until the end of June and I am  to work in a hospital for the summer holidays in August and September. For accommodation, I prefer log cabins, because I believe I can meet more people if I stay in log cabins and it's a lot of fun to talk with them. I'd like to play tennis and basketball while I am there. I have never played basketball, but I have played tennis for 6 years and I am a good player. I have never traveled abroad and don't know if I should bring a credit card with me. If you have suggestions, can you write to me again? Thank you again and take care, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  13 June, 2000. Dear Kim, Hi! How are you doing? I'm fine. As you asked me about the concert, I'll write about it today. First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took  long  to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get to excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans. By the time it finished, I was exhausted, but I certainly enjoyed this experience as you can meet many people at a time and what I liked most was that you can see famous stars very close and listen to their live music for free! Have you had an interesting experience? Please write about it in the next letter. I hope to hear from you soon. Yours ",33.0

I've got  three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August. I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee. So July is the only month I can take part in your activities. Second, regarding accomodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer. And I love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely nature in California for me to draw on my canvas. Let me ask a question about clothes and money. What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take. I am really looking forward to going there and  your reply. Yours faithfully Yun Sandra  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable. For example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually  traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment. However, people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service. For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them. Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping. Otherwise they can have lots of problem and  difficult to live. ",27.0
512," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show. Over the Rainbow, which you advertised. I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June. However, I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement. First of all, I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play. He did not play in the evening. It made me sad. Secondly, the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15. We waited for ages because we had not been informed. In addition, although you advertised the discounts tickets  available, they do not sale them any more according to your staff. Finally, we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show. It was closed because of the staff trainning. I am sure you can understand my disappointment. I must insist that you refund the cost of the show. Unless I hear from you within ten days, I shall have to take legal advice on the matter. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is believed that our life style has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machine etc. Especially for families. I have found  very expensive to buy them but there are  number of advantages. First of all, dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children. It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working. Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them. He complained about  a lot. Secondly, computers are useful for us as well, because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information, for example  traveling. However my family's members do less communicate with each other than we used to, because my children are keen on playing computer games. In my opinion, the morden technology make our life style combinient. It is very good for us but I think we should think about more carefully when we buy something for our children. ",34.0
541," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am delighted to answer you back to give you more informations about me since I have won such a nice price. As I have already planned my holiday for August, I will only be available in July, after my exams. It would be nice to have a tent because I have never been camping and would like to try it, at least once. The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much. My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it. I do not have any idea of what the weather is like and what kind of clothes I should take. Also, I would like to know if it is better to exchange my money in England or in the USA. I hope you will be able to answer these questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Like most of the girls I enjoy shopping but it can be either a great moment or a nightmare. What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering around and looking at everything. Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment. The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items. You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted. To conclude, I would say that to have a nice moment shopping you had better to save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient. ",35.0
349," Dear Sir/Madam. I am writting to inform  some problems we had. I want to the theatre to see ""over the rainbow"" at 17th June. First of all, we went to  ticket office to get the tickets. I thought we can buy discounts tickets according to the advertisement. However, we couldn't buy them the price. eventually, we got the tickets, Because we would like to see the musical and Danny Brook. After we arrive at the theatre, We were very disappointed. Because the different actor played  the musical that day. In addition, It started  20:15. We had to wait over 40 minitues. and we couldn't enjoy dinner at  theatre restaurant after the show. I think if the musical start late time, you should open the restaurant until late time. To tell the truth, we couldn't enjoy our evening. Would it be possible for me to back  money for  tickets. I am looking forward to hearing  you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We had a secret. After we finish school, we usually gathered the place. Where do you think ? It was ship!! There was  beach  our town. One day, Freddie found it there. it was old and  little broken. But it was  most important place in the world. We always played there and it was  adventure for us. One day, Suddenly,  heavy storm came  our town. I went to the sea to see our ship. My friends had come there, too. We worried about it and we tryed to pull it. It seemed to sank into the sea, but fourtunately,  storm went  soon. Our ship left on the beach. And our parents and teachers , too. Because Pat called them. Of course we couldn't play there after that. But now, I am thinking about new secret our place. Where do you think ? It is a secret!! ",17.0
272," London, 1st of June 2000 Mister Jones, I'm Omadar, a spanish male of eighteen years old who is spending in this town a week holiday. I decided to enjoy a play at the theatre  wich you're the manager to see the ""London's newest and best musical show."" My opinion? I had a very disappointing evening. First, Danny Brook doesn't play  ""Over the rainbow"" his paper was played by Danny De Vito. Also, the play started fourty five minutes late than the starting hour. I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not fourty five. Second, my wife and me payed £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts. The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were able that night. After a boring play, I decided to go  an theatre restaurant, but uncertainly it was closed. I decided to go home and prepare some sandwiches. The principal reason for I'm writting  you at the moment is that I want my money back, because I felt so disappointing with the theatre and also with the play. Your sincerelly,  [SEP]  It's a good question, because I never had asked it to myself. I think modern technology is changing so much my daily life and also is changing the life of others like me. Before modern technologies arrived, you can't comunicate as easy as today we can do. An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can discover more information than  a newspaper, and also information of all around the world, that possibly never I can access without  Internet. But,  is not only news or information. You can comunicate with people from place were you  never can imagine to have a trip because it will be too expensive. An extract could be the popular chats, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like to use the keyboard to tell something or comunicate, you can use video conference, a sistem wich  you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also  is the possibility of download things to your pc like software, pictures and also, music. The modern technologies make me  able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can wear this music to everywere. Also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we  probably still get on the ancient times. Who wants to return to the ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TV's, no phones, no PC's.. I'm afraid that the people on the ancient times lived although they don't have anything of these things, but me and everyone of this times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to this life. As well, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that  are so expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down   is because anything new is at the moment for sell. Is like a round tour. ",22.0
590," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for informing that I won the prize. I was very pleased to hear that. I am writing to inform you the information you asked me . As for the date to travel, I would like to go there in July. Owing toe the summer course I take starting in August, July is the only month I have free time. With regard to  place to stay, I would be most grateful if I could stay in a log cabin. I never could sleep in a tent in my life. I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities. Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some picture of beautiful scenaries in California. As photography, swimming is my best way of relaxation. It would be grateful if I could go swimming during the stays. Finally, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take there, and how much money I would need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although shopping is one of the most popular ways to reduce your stress, this is not always the case. There are some negative points that I would like to make about shopping. First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is looking around all  shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't find ones!! That's would be so exhausting. Next thing you have to do is trying them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms. After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted clothes taking off and putting on. That's a hell!! That's not the end of the story. You need to go home with bulky bags in both of your hands!! To sum up, although there is certainly a good side of shopping, such as  pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for  long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.

176," Dear Sir As I thought your advertisement was interesting, I went there but it was not  good as it should be. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook as you wrote. Secondly, it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30. According to the advertisement, the discounts were available. In fact, I had to pay the full price which costed me £15. After the show I intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because as you have known that the show started late, therefore the restaurant had closed before the show finished. As I have informed you  all the fact, I think the show was not worth the money I paid, so I want the refund for £15. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The story begins when Jan, who was Pat's best friend, told Pat that she saw Tim when he was cheating  the exam. The next day, Pat told everybody what she had heard from Jan, so when the news came to  teachers' ears, the teachers decided to give Tim  grade F in that subject and tell his parents!! Tim, who was the most powerful bully, was punished by his parents and of course by the teachers. He was furious with Jan, so what happened was Jan was bullied but not because of her fault, it was Pat's. Actually, I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat's way. It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim would haven't known who had told the teachers. Now, Jan has still been bullied nearly everyday. Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thier child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story. If all of us try to help her, I'm sure that we can make her a better school life. ",28.0
310,"  Mr/Mrs... manager I am writing to you about your musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". I have come and see  the theatre but I am very disappointed. I have come to see a good theatre but I did not. Danny Brook was going to be the starring actor but he wasn not,  actor took his place. That was very disappointing. The play was going to start at 19.30 but is was very delay It start at 20.15. And this is not all there is more. In the advertisement you write that there is  biscount available but It was not. Also the restaurant was closed because there was not left any food. I think the next time you write an advertiment you  write it with the right information. I did not have a perfect evening with so many proplems. So I am asking  to retern me some money back. I hope to hear from you soon Yours fouthfouly   [SEP]  Techology is a bad or a good efection? What does it offer to us? How  people use modern technology? Let see if we use the modern technology  we may have good and bad results. In  18 cetury technology started to grow more and more   20 century named the century of technology. During that time technology made a great step . Thechnology helps people. It informs people, hospital use modern technogoly   computer helps staders  help people do their job. But modern technology do a lot of bad thinks. A lot of county buy gans for their safty as they say but they buy them do kill people. Modern technology is effecting people  good and bad way. We have to be very careful with technology. Technogoly can't never stop going forward  so people always go farward but with  same effection of modern techology. Technology is in our life. ",22.0
161," Dear Sir/Madam: I'd like to complain about your 'Best' musical show that I went to when I'd a week's holiday in London. I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement wasn't true. I went there at 19.00 because the show started at 19.30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down. Finally, after an hour, when my term came to buy the entrance ticket, you staff said I couldn't have a discount and so as anyone. However I bought the ticket even  it was more expensive because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol, Danny Brook. But when the show started, they said Danny wasn't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the situation I had was unlike what the advertisement said. After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00. So what's the point  to say 'visit our restaurant after the show'? I'd a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays. I'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I'll write letters to all the media departments to show how tricky you were. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He went to see the headmaster and told him all the truth. Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane to the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster  after he punished Jon. The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspended from school for a week. This happened in the Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did  was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us. Pat heard that and  went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished  their bad behaviours. After that event happened, Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy. They both got into trouble because of him. They do hate him so much.

1214," Dear Mrs. Maria Smith. I got your letter this morning and I am very pleased to give you some information. As I know, he booked the Palace Hotel in  downtown . When you go to the conference, you can take a bus or a taxi. But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend to walk. Because there are a lot of beatiful trees and you can see the sea. And also it takes just fifteen minutes. I think everybody can enjoy it. By the way the end-of-conference party is a kind of fairwell party. There will be three parts. The first part, the chairman and a few guests will have a speech and the second part, the participacients will evaluate themselves, and the the last part it will provide dinner and drinks. It will be not too formal  party. So you can wear what you like. Moreover, I would like to recommend  'City tour' for three hours. Everybody an enjoy themselves. It is £12 each and there is a reduction for groups. I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact with me any time. And have a nice time in my town and send my regard to Richard. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and  convenient. Moreover we can not live without them. For example: electricity,  computer, telephon, boat, and car (wheel), etc. None of them are unimportant for us. But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them. If you look around at home, there are a lot of electric things. Electricity could be able to invent other things. It also gave us more free time, especially for women. It has abosolutly reduced women's our house working time. Evenmore we can enjoy our night with lights. If we want do something, we can do it at night  same as   day. Finally the quality of our life is changed by electricity. It could reduce our working time and make us enjoyable. It is also advancing more and more. It will give us  better future! Have you ever imagined that you would drive  electric car! ",25.00
106," Dear Mr/Mss I'm writing  you in complain about  musical show, that I have visited last evening. I had a week holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure, however it was the worse evening in my life. First of all, the actors were different from those who were advertised. Second, the show started at 20:15, althoug I read that it started at 19:30! More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant, but it was closed, it really disappointed me. It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, so it is still my dream because of your show. So, I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back. I hope you'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show, you should return my money. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern techology changed my daily life. Fifty years ago people even didn't think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented an electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that centure. And nowadays modern technology can change all our life. I mean, almost everyone has now a car, a computer, a mobil phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet. Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen. Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave. What is more Modern technology prevents different illnesses. Further more, yesterday I've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view  in 2050  year everybody will fly to the space. On the other hand people can atrophided of all this inventions. He become lazy because they know that they can seat on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton. In conclusion I want to say that inspite of this, I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems. ",29.0
923," Dear Ms. Ryan I refer to your letter regarding the prize I have won in your competition. I was really pleased to find out that I have an opportunity to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. As requested in your letter please find below some additional information about me and my plans. I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged for a part time job later this summer. I prefer to stay in a tent as I go campping every summer and am used to slipping in tents. From the list of activities, which was provided by you, I'd like to choose photography and swimming. I'm very good at swimming as I have been a member of different swimming clubs since I was 6 and I chose photograthy because I have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it.

Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report Subject: Video about daily life at our school. Introduction: To support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school I have spend some time discussing it with other students,  observing and analaising an avrege day in our scholl and came up with some suggestions. Places to video: We should try to video not only class rooms but also our playground, cafe, sport hall, art club & library. Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are  very important part of our school life. Activities to video: We should show students during their formal studies as well as after lessons. I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as  anual sport turnament or wellcoming evening for new students. Conclugen: To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not to film anything longer than 1 or 2 minuts and have a nice mixture of places, faces and events. If you have any further comments or questions regarding this case please let me know. King Regards ",28.0
335," Dear Sir/Madam My name is Alida Fanetti, and I'm writing  you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently. One evening, while I was walking around the city I saw a very interesting advertisement, which was about a musical show. I'm a fun of Danny Brook so when I read in the advertisement his name I immediately decided to go to the show. The tickets were a little expensive but I was with other TEN people, so when we read ""Discounts Available"" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for group of numerous people. It wasn't true; there weren't any discounts. The show started at 20.15 and not at 19.30 so we waiting for  long time. Before the show started, a man said that there wasn't Danny Brook because he was ill. It was a disaster. After the show, which wasn't as good as we expected, we decided to go to the theatre restaurant. It was closed because people in the kitchen weren't ready with the food. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and I, would be gratefull if you will give us some money back, if it is possible. I hope to receive an answer. Your faightfully  [SEP]  ""the old man and the sea"" BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY Dear Sandro, I'm Alida, how are you? I'm writing  you because I have an important thing to tell you. I read in the newspaper that in the next  days some book of short stories are going to be read on the radio. A few days ago you told me that you have to read ""the old man and the sea"" by Hemingway for school; well, on friday  is going to be read, on the frequency 96.7, this book. I suggest you to listen to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading for you. I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's a possibility for ""busy people"" to know important and beautiful short stories and books. Well, I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book. I read it two months ago and I liked it very much. It's a sad story but it makes you know  a tipe of life that you can't imagine that really exists. The old man is a sad person but he loves his live and lives on the beach because he can't stay without see the sea for a day. I think you will enjoy it. Now I have to stop writing but I'll write you more letters. I hope you will listen to this book on the radio. Write me back soon and tell me about your impression   (I mean if you enjoyed the story or not!) Love P.S. Remember 96.7 on friday at 15.30 p.m. ",25.0
86," Dear Sir, Last week I stayed in London for  holidays. During my stay in that beautiful city, I thought it was a good idea to go to the theatre to enjoy a Musical show, so I decided to go to your theatre to see ""over the Rainbow"". It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who was in the theatre. First of all, I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement. In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m. but, in fact, it began at eight fifteen. I also, found out that no discounts were available. In spite of it was said in the advertisement . Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker has had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables. In the advertisement there's no mention about getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give it back to me. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village in the southern cost of Spain with my friend Pat. We usually went to the beach to have a bath and to enjoy the fantastic whether in that part of Spain during the summer. One day we found out a beautiful little beach next to the big one where some people were taking a sunbath and some children were playing football in the sand. At it was so beautiful, we decided to come back to the beach at night to see the moon, the see and the stars. When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two persons doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, at the end, we saw that they had robbed a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell it to anybody. It was our secret. Unfortunately Pat explained the story to a friend of us and I don't know how, but the robbers knew that we had seen all they had been doing. So, now we are in danger because of that. ",26.0
15," Dear Mrs. Jane Clark, Recently I was at the annual international arts festival, that you organized. I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving  a possibility to know more about modern art. I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries. Unfortunately, only six countries were represented this year at the festival, but I hope that soon there would be much more of them. I extremely liked all  concerts, shows,  exhibitions, but why there weren't any photograph exhibitions? I think, you should make some next year. Then, I want to mark, that  concert halls were too small, that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts. Then, I want to say, that  plays and films were exellent, but it wasn't enough of them for me. May be you should make more next year? And at the end, my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea, because you don't have to stay in queues to buy a ticket for a show, you want to go to. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Lucia, I was very pleased to receive your letter. You asked, if there are some school rules in my country. As you know, I'm studying at the private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes. I'll give you an example. In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke. The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars. So nobody smokes there. I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule. But some of my friends really would like to change it. You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home. Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends. The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day. I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life. Look forward to hearing from you, ",29.00
1189,"  Dear Maria, First of all, I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill. As the conference must go on, I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference. According to the hotel, the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place  we are going to have the conference. The hotel is The Palace Hotel. It'is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference. About the party, we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel  you will stay. The party will be in a friendly atmosphere so don't worry about what to wear. There will be only our group, so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves. Lastly, what you could possibly do while you will be waiting for three hours, for some people who want to go shopping. The shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel, however, some people may want to just wait at the hotel, having a cup of coffee. The cafe in the hotel is available. I hope that  information will be useful. If you have any questions I am more than happy to help. I look forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Could you live without this? Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had gone. How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work. How would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without  toaster!!! How would you cope with all those? Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances. The electricity is a clever invention. Everything bases on the use of electricity, for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information! Life wouldn't be easy if we didn't have electricity. The electricity is very important in keeping our lives go. No matter where you are, what you do, apparantly, you need the electricity. Let's think  this way, if we didn't have the electricity, there would be no other inventions at all!! I, personally, couldn't live without the electricity. It has already affected and play a great role in my life. I watch the television and use the computer everyday. Moreover, other facilities in my house,  telephone, air-conditioner, fridge, for example, they are all need the electricity. That'is why it is very important to my life. ",37.00
1123," Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I am being the representative of my class to thanks  for organising a good programme in London, especially the visiting of  Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and  can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in  National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited this two places before. So we decide to choose the other programme which have seen as an entertainment. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show is hold at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is on Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions including leisure and sports wear. In spite of these, there is also make up and hairstyles which attract girls most. Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it holds  only 1 day which is Tuesday March 14. And, it is free for students. So I think it is worth visiting. Personally, here is my some suggestions about how the programme could be changed. We can join the programme that you planned as usual and  we go to that fashion show on Tuesday. Finally, the above information is my opinion and I hope you can accept it. Thanks for your kind attention. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  How is the home of the future will be? Remain the same, as usual or have a great difference? For me, I think people's home may not be built on the ground. The home will be built on the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the home is built on the sky. It will save a lot of electricity as solar energy is used. And, there should be a electrical servant in everyone's home. So there's no need for people to do the household work. There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make people not sleepy. If you're tire, the pill can give you vitamin, protein and make you refresh For electrical goods, there will be no any kind of electrical products except computer. People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listen to music,  chat with people. As the computer is being as a multi-functional products. on the other hand, there're some ways that remain the same. The toilet should remain the same as people need to use  daily and nothing can replace it. Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun. Since friends and family members won't change and replace, by anything. These are my imagination. I really wonder how the home of the future will be. ",25.00
132," June 17 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you about my complaints of mine about the musical show of your theater, that I have watched a week ago, during my stay in London. That evening, the problems started with the tickets... On the contrary with  the advertisement, that was published on the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International Student Identity card. Secondly, the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed. Another problem was the starring male actor: the well known and talented actor, mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the theater restaurant, which was said to be open and available for meals after the show; but it was closed. So, I did not have the ""perfect evening out"" as stated in your advertisement. I think you owe me an excuse and a full refund. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Clothes of the Future Have we ever seen a naked person in the streets? Except  some very extraordinary cases, no. Tell me, why  people care so much about what they wear and what others wear? Because, the clothes have a crucial part in our everyday lives. Maybe because of this, just like living things, the clothes have evolution. This evolution has never stopped and it will continue. How about the clothes of people, a hundred years later? In my opinion the clothes of the world, after a century , will be styled in the Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout the history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be ""out"". Of course, the technology will change too. Maybe, new kinds of fabrics, that are capable of insulating light, or heat will be used. Actually, some clothes like that are being developed today; but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future. Finally, it seems to me that, the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalist and minimalist and also, the fabrics that are used will change too. In fact, we can not know, what will the time give and take away, so let's wait and see: the clothes of the future. ",34.0
1240," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give you some advice of an international student conference. First of all, the name of  hotel which we have been booked into is  Palace Hotel. And we have two choices to get to the conference, a bus or a train. Both of them are as convinience as getting there. The day before we will leave there, we have a party which takes place in our hotel. It is a kind of formal party, so we should be well-dressed. I suggest that you wear a formal dress. There is some finger foods and drinks. It might be a great party for  end of  conference. End of all, in my opinion we could go  a center of the town because there is many places to have a look  and go shopping. It's quite a nice  and a suitable place to spend for three hours. It could be interesting for them. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Imagine our life without a telephone. If a telephone haven't been invented, we wouldn't have lived perfectly like nowadays. Wouldn't you think we rely on it more than we expect? A telephone is used when we need to contact with someone, and also an emergency situation and  an internet. It has various way to use, however, nowadays it is not only used by these purpose, but also it keeps our company. Even if you feel alone, you can talk and hear from your friend easily. Then it makes you happy. Long time ago people lived without this perfect invention. But how? They used to keep in touch with someone with a letter. In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with, it was a only way. So that's why they have invented a telephon. Now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone. Who wouldn't  thank for this great invention? ",23.00
432," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because I have recently been at your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening. I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available. I asked for it but the answer I received was that there wasn't any kind of discount. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at the moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant  to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed! I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to reply but there had been only problems. I'd like not only to reply but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't ""perfect"" as you advertised but it was a big disaster. I am looking forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Every aspect of our daily life is influenced by technology. I'll give you some examples describing how technology affects my life every day. The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare  fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer. During all the day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail. Sometime I stay alone all the day but I have contacts with many people. When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to control my bank account  use  Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office. When I finish to work I come back home. If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven. If I'm too tired to go out with my friends I finish my day looking a programme on television. I know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world. To conclude, I think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life. But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to make a step without it. ",33.0
496," 17th June 2000 The manager of the Circle theatre. Dear sir or madam, I am writing to you in response of your advertisement about the show of the Circle Theatre. I have to say that I am realy disappointed bout your advertisement because you mentioned some points that are not true. Firstly I'd like to complain about the actor of the show. On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night. Secondly another ploblem was about the starting time, according to your advertisement the play starts at 19.30 and instead it started on 20:15, this is about almost an hour delay. Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, Something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount. Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play, but the restaurant was closed and I'd like to know why. I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy  to ask for a money refund. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  The 21st Century is also known as the gold century of high technology and science. And I must admit that this is true. Many thinks have changed within the last 100 years. Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into a growing monster which doesn't have an ending. Every single day we hear about new products, new methods, new technological miracles which have turned up side down our daily lives. The simpliest example of modern high tech is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the P.C -. Reserches have shown that almost every single house owns a P.C. Some people use them for their job because they do need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun. Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the T.V, the microwave, the video the satelite , the cd player and hundreds of others. All thease play a serious role in our daily life with out  ever understanding it. All of us have turned into pathetic, technological, robots. Those things can and do make our lifes easier and more comfortable, but the call us away from our friends, our families and more over they lead us to madness and cut  any relantionship with everything that suround us and keep us in life.

I would like the travel start only  july if possible, because this is my Hoilday start, at the Camp California I would like my accommodation in  tents, because I work in  Army and in the camp I usually stay in  tent at night, so I will feel more comfortable. In those activities I would like to choose Swimming and climbing for my activities in  Camp, this two activities I usually do in the Army Camp, I know how to climb up on Rachiat outside and help other people to climp up. Swimming I'm teach people in  Army. And I have a question to ask? In the Camp do I need any money to bring with and what kind of clothes  I have to wear and take? Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  To make a daily life video in school, we should concentrat on the most things we do in a school, the most thing we do in a school is haveing lesson, it is a very useful parts of this video and is the main subject. The lessons we take in the video, should be the main subject we study. In the video I think we should take part to talk about, what we doing in  feel time and study period. This is another important part of our school life, and we should make a section to talk about lunch and where are the people go to eat their lunch or what they do? After we talk about lunch, we should take about  activities we are doing and the systems about the activities in school or outside school and make a little section of the School term, and what kind of sport the people like the most. At the end of the video, we should find one or two studen sit together and ask them a few question of how do they feel  to study in the School? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school.

1139," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to your advertisement which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction to your article. First of all, your advertisement mentions that the course had to be cancelled, because the teacher was ill, but the course cancelled only  the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that no body registered for the local history course. So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses   is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for being these courses so popular is that people are very interested in these kind of activities. Apart from this the teachers was very experienced and the equipment was particullarly coteporary. Furthemore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention. Finaly, I would like to tell you that the weekend was not as disappointing as you mention bud I would like to thank you for you kind attention to my letter, and I would like you to write another article which will lit to the truth Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, I am very happy because I haven't received any letter from you, for  long time, and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not  serious , I didn't write to you. I hope you are fine. First of all, you musn't panic. It's not  serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs. In my opinion as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant. If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you. You'd  better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum  include big tips from the tourists. Apart from these, despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole  next year, if you are lucky. Last but not last, I hope you will find my opinion helpful I wish your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's about a problem. Whatever choice you will make I'm sure it will be the best for you. Drop me a line. Lots of Love, ",34.0
655," Dear Helen, I've just seen your letter and I'm really delighted to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer. I would prefer to be in  log cabins because I feel insecure staying in  tent. While I'll be at the Camp, I would like to play tennis and  swimming. I've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day. I'm very good at swimming and my level  is medium at tennis. If possible, could you let me know what I'll need for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend. I'm excited to  go on holliday there and thanks to you, I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I want to tell you about my good experience I had last month. I'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous. At first, I'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order. They were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene. At the end, we have had a beer and we talked together. I was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends. During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up. It was unbelievable to realize that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends. It is difficult to explain what I'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people which I'd known only for  few days. If possible, I would like introduce you to them, they are very nice guys. Best wishes ",31.0
166," Dear Sir, I am writing to you because of the latest musical show you played in  Circle Theatre. I am keen on musicals and I have seen many of them in different parts of the world. Unfortunately the one I saw a week ago in the Circle Theatre was one of the worst. Here are some argeuments telling why me and many other people from the audience are so disappointed. First of all the musical should have started at 19.30 but unfortunately we had to wait forty five minutes. It is a wasting of time. Moreover the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical plays  great Danny Brook. I must admit I'd been looking forward to see him. In fact at the stage appeared  compleatly different person. Also discounts for tickets wasn't available. After the show together with my friends I went to the theatre restaurant to have a romantic supper, unfortunately it was closed without any sensible reason. At the end of my letter I would like to ask if it is possible to have some money back. I would be very pleased if you answered my request soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Besides this little thing she is actually perfect. But to make everything clear I'll start from the beggining. It was two years ago. The school finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with plenty of spare time. I didn't wanted to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim gave a proposition about going at the sea by his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going for a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. Parents were very pleased and happy we are so ambisious. Of course we didn't wanted to go there, it was just a ""cover"". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we were waiting. We promised to keep it in secret. Two days before going Pat was packing her luggage and asked her mother to help her. During  chat Pat mentioned about  sea and her mother found out that something was wrong. Pat started to cry and told about everything. As a result we were grouded for all  holidays and all because  our almost perfect Pat. ",26.0
198," Dear Sir, I have read your advertisement for the show  and I went to the theatre to see it but I had a very disappointing evening. In your advertisement,  said that one of the actor was Danny Brook but it was a different actor. This was very disappointing and I believe that all the people there, were angry. The musical show must have been started at half past seven but it started at quarter past eight. About the tickets, I the advertisement said that discounts would be available but it would not. Also the theatre restaurant was closed and I do not know why. When I read the advertisement, it said that the restaurand would be opened. Lastly, I want to tell you that I had not  a perfect evening and I would be grateful if you could send me my money back. I am looking forward to your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my best friend. She lived next to my house and we went to the same school. I told her all my problems and I could rely on her. One day I heard my mother to tell my father that she want to divorce because she can't live with him any more. When I heard it, I went to my room and I was crying. I called Pat to come to my house because I was not very good and  to tell her what had happened. Few minutes later Pat came to my house and I told her that my parents are going to divorce. Pat did not believe me and she started to ask why. I told her that I did not know. She helped me to forget it for a few minutes, she made me to laugh and the she left. But before she left I begged her not to tell anybody. The other morning I went to school and all the students came next to me and told me not to be mad because of my parents. Then I realised that Pat told  my secret and I felt very angry, that's why I said at the beginning that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. ",28.0
409," Dear Sir or Madam: I'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" that was held in your theatre. It was a very disappointing evening so I ask for my money back. The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full ticket. Another problem was that the show started 45 minutes late and I had a surprise when I saw that the main character was not played by Danny Brook, who is one of my favourite actors. Finally I want to complain about the theatre restaurant. We read that we could visit it after the show but it was closed because the waiters were on strike. I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking  my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Fashion news are followed by lots of people. We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now. But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now? People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for they daily life. I think that this tendence will not change but what will change is life. We tend to  a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it. Another important thing will be the use of technology. Scientists are looking for new materials that will made our clothes more comfortable  stronger. Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies and modern devices will be included in our daily clothes. Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected with technology and society. ",32.0
74," Dear Mrs Jane Clark I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with  International Arts Festival, which was organised by you last year. However I think that International Arts Festival is a great idea and I suggest you prepare it better. Firstly, it was written on the advertisment that there would be stars and artist from around the world I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artist from only six countries and in my opinion there should be more. Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls, which in my opinion were too small. That was the reason why some people were complaining. Thirdly, I suggest you should put more plays and films  next year, because watching them is a very nice way of spending our freetime. Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea about giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was excelent because it attracted peoples' attention Lastly, I'd like to give you a piece of advice. I suggest you invite some film stars, because they are very famous and people like them I hope you'll look into these matters and improve the festival next year. I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make the world go round, so they always look for a job with  big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it. In my opinion the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities  to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get  well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated. They have to think about some season jobs. Firstly, the good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are not able to do  shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and  permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are  good mathematic you can be a seller. Thirdly if you are good looking you can apply for a job in  restaurant and become  waiter. Maybe you'll not get a big salary but think about the tips, which in the posh restaurants are very high. Lastly, if you like playing instruments and you don't like working you can go busking. If you are  good musician you will get a lot of money. ",30.00
39," 16th, Dec. 2000 Dear Mr. Clark, I'm writing this letter to complain and to suggest something about your ""International Arts Festival"". I visited the festival for 2 days. I also read an advertisement in ""The Times"". I thought it would be interesting and exciting. When I visited the festival, of course, it was really good. I was impressed of the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different culture and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days  the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for  student too. However, you said ""Stars and artists from around the world"" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time. Except  these two things, it was quite good. I'd like to suggest this - concerned with plays and films. Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival. I'm looking forward to hearing your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I'd like to tell you about my experiences. Before that you have to think  why you need to earn money and how you do that. It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose. Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old. Secondly, I made  brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was  part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works. I could earn money,  also I got a career. Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult, but I think that was  easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So  lose was bigger than  profit. In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose  proper part-time job. Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge. You must consider the purpose too. If you haven't  purpose, you would waste money easily and quickly. ",27.00
622," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you about the two weeks in California I won in the competition. California has always been in my dreams. I will be leaving university in a few month's time but  is in my plans to continue my studied at another University trying to do a master of two years. Having decided to take a month off between University and course it would be great to have my holidays from 1st to 15th July. I have always wanted to spend my holidays in  tent but my father has never given me the permission, and this would be an ideal opportunity for me to learn about camp life. I am a good swimmer and also well at golf (handicap twelve) I took a certificate as Teachear in both of them six years ago before I went to ""CROARA GOLF"" in Milan where I organised  evening's entertainment for  customers. I hope that you can let me know, before I will live, how many degrees there will be so that I cannot make a mistake choosing my clothes and how much aproximately I will spend in money. I look forward to reading from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me at (0297) 8245123 in case of need. Yours sincerely, Bonfilia Conti  [SEP]  I do not agree that it is preferable to phone at the shop and give them a list of items you need instead of going to the shop and choose whatever you want.

To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in  tents, that's in my opinion a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals, although I don't mind living in log cabins. In spite of liking all the sports you wrote  in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing, because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child. I have got a doubt, it is not very important, but I would like to know if I need any money or  all is payed , the kind of clothes I should wear, if the weather is good or bad... and all the extra information you can send me. Thank you very much for the prize. Yours faithfully. Eliza Vasquez.  [SEP]  Why  people like so much go shopping? In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family, so for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money. Othrewise, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy hardly ever, only when they need clothes or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as  funny as you want, although if you do it very often, it will be as an obligation in the future. To sum up, all you make in small cuantities is good and funny, but don't encrease them if you don't want to feel uncomfortable. ",28.0
354," SOLES LEDIA CI HACIA DE LOREDES MADRID THE CIRCLE THEATRE LONDON Dear Sir, I am writing  you to complain about the musical show which took place the last 1st of May in ""the Circle Theatre"" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous, I was surprised of its facade and also I was anxious for the beginning of the performance. My friends and me thought that it would be the perfect night  in London but everything changed when the show had been delayed more than forty-five minutes. Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward for that marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed  us were not the same as the  theatre, we asked for our special discount for be students with less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rudely answer of the woman who sold the tickets. In addition to this, we realized when the show began that the main character was not Danny Brook. At top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat on the theatre. You can imagine how upset we were and we asked you for our  reward for the night that we spent . Yours Faithful  [SEP]  Nowadays we think in the modern technology as something usual in our lives. For instances with the arrive of  Internet, the new digital television or the researchers in the medecin; we are discovering how we can change our lives only with  press  a botton, or look for something new with only think about it... we realize that the new technology it have just begun , and  lively in a few years we will be very avanced in this way. In my point of view the new techincs have more advantages than disadvantages, my reasons for saying that is because furthermore we can live better, we can also have more ways of know now to live healthy and how to spent our free time. Although the technology also is used for create new types of weapons and also for killing people, it is only the worst part of this. But however it is a good idea to spend out money in make new enterprises which pay the researchers and they could investigate how  to improve ourselves. ",25.0
776," Dir Madam I'm writing to you in reply to your letter. I was really suprised when I opened it. I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me on August and I will have to look after them. I prefer staying in tens to staying in log cabins. Because it remainds me  my childhood. I used to going with my friends to the camp, wich was situeded on a seaside. We had always enjoying ourselves. Never had I got such a great time. From your's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing. I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport. I find it very atractive. I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old. However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport. For me it is only a hobby. Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport. I would like to ask what kinds of clothes should I take with me. and I wonder if prizes are high there. Yours faithfully Angelina  [SEP]  I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want. It isn't true. Nowdays we have many big shopping centers. We like them because everything is on one place. The most suitable time for shopping is  weekand when parents don't work and children haven't got a school. Because of that shopping centers are over crowded. You can't buy something in  peacful and calm athmospher. In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high, of course not all of them. However such centers are very useful and necessary. I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is  extremly hugh queu to the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable. If you bought something goregous, you would be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have  bad mood don't go shopping. ",26.0
416," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre. First of all, there was written in the advertisement for the show, that there would be Danny Brook as main actor, but a different actor played in the show. The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me. Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there was not  discounts for ticket, while you wrote the contrary. Moreover, I could not go to the theatre restaurant because, by the time the show had finished, it had already closed. Definetely, it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit. This was her only fault. She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her. That was why she decide to change her behaviour. She was given a chance: if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would have started trusting her. The secret was about a surprise-party for her bestfriend's birthday. As soon as the arrangement for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend. But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more. The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret. All her friends were amazed at  her change and started trusting her at once. ",31.0
786," Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to you in reply of our letter, that had let me know I am the winner of the first prize of your competition. First of all, I am very happy to spent two weeks at Camp California in the USA. Yet, I could only travel  July because I am a student and so my holidays begin on July. In addition, I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being near nature and especially singing birds. Thus, I enjoy sports and I would like to practice swimming and climbing. I am not too bad at these sports. To conclude, will you kindly let my know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  This year, our English class has decided to make a short video about daily life at our school. (It is a graduate engineer school where we are studying mecanics and energetics.) That is why we have to single out wich lessons and other activities should be filmed. On one hand, we should be interested in the lessons. At first, the research and design courses are exiting since we are studying how cars are built. Secondly, we should interview the teacher of heat transfert since his courses are rally breathtaking. That seems to be quite surprising, yet this teacher manages to convey his knowledge. On the other hand, we should be interested in the other activities such as sports wich could appeal  more students in our school. For example, our basketball team has won a local championship. To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to make come out the best of ourselves. ",27.0
996," Dear Miss Ryan, I'm writing to you as regards the letter you've sent me about the competition I've won. I've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it'll be an exciting trip. With regard to the date of the trip, July would be best because in June I'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins. I've never been camping before, I guess I'm not an outdoor girl, but I'd like to give it a try, so I'd rather tents than cabins. I'm really keen on sports, especially sailing. I've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly manage the rigging and sail. I'm also fond of tennis, I've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer. So, I think I'll do sailing and tennis. I'm not really sure of what kind of clothes to take, could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot. Sincerely, Diana Delgado  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy, we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us  stunningly beautiful. While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop. ",40.0
1114," Dear Mr Robertson, On the behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose to us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of the English culture... However, we would like to suggest you something: A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which seems to be very attractive. Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there. Let me explain  you what it is: It must be an exhibition which takes place in the ""Central Exhibition Hall"" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different leisures, make up and so on... What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a ""Shopping-Afternoon"" - that we can even put on Wednesday during the free-time - so that  to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show... Please, Let us know. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The respect of Famous people's private life has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a ""public job"". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox: Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question... As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a ""public job""?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed! But to solve this problem, we may think first about its origin... ""Reading the gossips"": isn't it what anyone of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy. Why not? To conclude, I would say that ""privacy"" and ""celebrity"" can't go together. It's just a matter of choice: being aware of that problem, everyone is free to become famous or not... ! ",32.00
369," Dear Sir or Madam, I saw your advertisement yesterday. I have visited the circle theatre. I would like to say that I am not satisfied of it. First of all, there were any different actor. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad. For example, it is said the show starts at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. I have waited around one hour. Now I have a cold because it was so cold  evening. Thirdly, I would like to enquire is about the tickets. Firstly, twenty pounds are a lot of money for such a organization, on the other hand it is said that  discount is available. It is false, I have paid twenty pounds. What other I would like ask is that why it is said this is the London's newest and best musical show. I can mention it is the worst musical show. And I was invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed because there were not anything to drink or to eat. Finally it was not the perfect evening out. In conclusion, I really did not like it. I want to ask if it is possible to give me  money back. I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At the present, the technology develops rapidly. In my opinion,  World can not do without it. Firstly, I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological machines. For instance,  TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt,  discovering of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is connected to the computers. For example, education, researching of the Universe and others. Another thing I would like to say is that modern technology help us to go anywhere  rapidly. The most suitable examples are the planes. What other  I would like to mention  how important the modern technology is . We research our plant, other planets and many other things with the help of it. Finally I think that at the present the life is more comfortable . In my opinion, no one can do without modern technology. It go on to develop and always will be the most importand think in our life.

627," Dear Ms, Ryan, Thank you for your letter to inform me for the prise I had won. I would like to answer to you question, please notice that I can travel only in July because only then I can take holidays from my work, after the busy time of  month  May and June. I prefer to staying in  cabin because never before I when on holidays in  tent., so I think  is more corfotabel to sleep in  bet instand of outside in  tent. The activities I would like to do durring these two week it's basketball and swimming. Basketball I think I can playing well, because  few years ago I was  mamber of the scool team. Swimming it's not my favorite sport but I prefer swimming than golf or tennis. Please could you informy  what do you meen when do you said all the accommodotion are paid for, that is including foods and drinks, so  I know how mutch money I have to take with me, and what kind of wather it's during this period of the year so  I know what kind of clothes I have to take. I look forward for this competition. Best Regards  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I would like to inform you about my experience of the last pop concert. It was very nice for me to help because I have seen so many people and I have goten a lot of experience of things that I never had done before. I was the assistent of the responsible person for the clothes and make-up of the pop-group, realy I was very nervous about that because  was the first time with so famous people, but I am very happy that all the things went very well Kim what  realy particularly liked was when I was asked to do the make-up on my on realy I was very nervous but at  same moment very happy, but every thing when well and everyboby was very hapy with my work. Realy I think you have to tray to do the same things the next summer, I realy had enjoyed . Best Regards ",20.0
992," Dear Helen Ryan; I have just received your letter which is made me so hapy. I can not belive that I won first prize in your competition, because I always belived I am an unluky man and now I think somethings are changing in my life. I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have  one month break at July, so please make my log cabin ready by july. I  prefer stay in  cabin because I have some experience with tents from my childhood and it was not  very good experience therefore I would like to stay in  cabin. You saying in your letter I could do two activities from the list which is show many exciting activities. I will definitly chose Basketball and Swimming wich are the my dream sport. I used to be play in  school team when I was in high school and our team was the one of the best Basketball team in  all county and I  also very good at swim. I would like to ask a few things, specialy  wheather: how is the weather  in July in the U.S.A. What kind of clothes I will need and how much money I should take with me, Because I have never been   U.S.A. before and I don't know anything  I am looking forward to your reply letter. Your sincerely  [SEP]  I have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowday  some people  are calling shopcholic. They are just like alcholics and this people are every day doing shopping because they can not stop themself unless they have not got money for spend. I can not believe how they doing this things every day, even when I need something at home I alway try to find out something to use instead of that things. Because nowdays whereever you go there is  big queue and I hate being waited. The queue is not only the problem if you go by car there is  parking problem, if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you won't be alway luky  to find a seat to seat. If you go shopping for (buy) clothes that is the worse kind of shopping. Specialy if you want to buy  with your girlfriend or if you are already  girl you have to be read for hours to spend try on and off. I realy hate go shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they went into a shop they want try on every single cloth and they do not realise to time. Some people says ""shopping is not alway enjoyable"" but for me   definity unenjoyable and I think it will be  same   rest of my life. ",19.0
473," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to hang me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot  good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late , we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen  and who seemed not to know by heart his role! Shame on you! After that ""show"" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize I want that you hang me my money back and very quickly. Your faithfully..  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology had changed  human being's daily life long before I was born. Nowadays according to me the most important revolution is connected with new technologies. Let's take the mobil phone. Our parents used the phone to make an important appointment. Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is ""mobil"". And I'm not different I've got one and it has changed my everyday life. I always can be reached, I can phone friends when I know I would be late and thanks to that appliance I feel less nervous and now I'm sure I couldn't live without it. It's the same with  Internet and that's a very new thing. I send and receive more mails than letters! I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I'm working because it take up just some minutes. With  Internet and according to me the world is become smaller and bigger at the same time. Smaller because I can visit an American library without leaving my desk and bigger because it seems to be endless. Yes my daily life has been changed and it's a good thing. ",32.0

1068," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm a student of your college and I write this letter for my class because I'm the class chief. On the hall of our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show  is it possible. We know that we will spend three days in London in a  with a determinate programme. First of all we make thanks for the good programme  especially for  the Science Museum on Tuesday 14th About the London Fashion and Leisure Show we are very excite to go because it's on extravagant and unusual show with leisure, sports wear and hairstyles. As I see  your programme the shopping  is at the same time of the London Fashion  so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to  Central Exhibition Hall without doing  shopping. It would be a great opportunity because for students it's free. If you don't have problems we attend yours, we hope good answer. Thank you  [SEP]  I think that my house isn't  of the future. It is comfortable, not too big with a lot of carpets and antiques components for example potterys, my bed, and a wardrobe of my grandmother. Think people's homes will be different in the future about the new materials of structures, they will have a lot of computers for doing recipes and making  shopping while you are staying at home. We will have a relaxing room, with soft light, music New Age and a lot of essences. I think that we can't stop the progress but if we want we can conserve  traditional things. The home of the future will be very impersonally and the atmosfear will be cold and very essencial. ",24.00

612," Dear Helen Ryan I've just received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in your competition  2 weeks at Camp California in the USA. I am very glad to hear that and would like to tell you all the informations you need to know from me. I would be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be long enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go on other holidays because for  Easter holiday I need to attend  Tennis competition in the name of my school and we need time to practise. In  Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going to a ferry trip with my relatives. That are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other times. I do appologize about that. I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I say before that I have to attend  tennis competition so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9, now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county player  I was 12. I attended 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad influences me to play tennis and  enjoy it. For climbing, I started to be interested in it since it was 14. My family live near the sea so we have got quite a lot of chance to go climbing. I'm not scared of height and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me. I would like to ask you a few questions. How hot is it in California in July? so I know what kind of clothes I need. Do I need a lot of money, will we have time for shopping. What kind of food do we eat? This is because I cannot eat Pork. If there is any unconvenience, please feel free to tell me. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim How are you? I am sorry that I didn't write any letter to your during  last month. I really wish you were with me last month. Quess what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that happened at my school. That's why I have no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it! As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say ""yes"" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in  drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television. The preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing  concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing  stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like? It was good fun though! , but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do. At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition make me to try to work very hard and this term I get A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now I have my aim about what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder. I hope you will feel like me one day. I will write to you again soon and tell you how I  getting on. Lots of love ",25.0
193," To the manager of The Circle Theatre! I have been recently in London and I've seen the art ""Over The Rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me. It should start at 19.30 and it had at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed. But the worst thing in ""London's newest and best musical show"", as you called it, was the abscentness of Danny Brook. The actor wich was ""dancing"" was horrible. He had been mistakeing all the time. At the advertisement, there was written ""your perfect evening out"". Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money, I hope that in future you will corect all this mistakes. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told him my worst love story. One day, I was going to school by bus and  I don't know why  I went to the end of it. I looked up and I saw her, standing next to me with her friend. Every time when I looked up at her my legs were shaking so I couldn't come up and talk to her! But with help from my friend who convinced me to do this, I've met her. Her name was Sue and she was so beautiful that I still can't find words which could be good to describe her. I was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so I couldn't say anything! I was in Love but that wasn't nice. Few days later someone told me that Sue was actually a boy! That was supposed to be a joke from my ""coleagues""! From that moment I feel like I have been in front of a video camera and the operator of it is me! I couldn't speak to anyone. The worst thing in this story is, that Pat told this to everyone at school. From that moment I live alone. Thanks to Pat. ",23.0
967," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I have won the first prize! I am extremly happy about this. I am writing because of same information that you need. I have only the possibility to take  holiday in July because I am going to start a new education at the beginn of August. Of course I would like to stay in a tent. When I was a child we were often camping. To stay in a tent will remind my of a unforgottable time. There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes  hard to choose only two. Given the circumstances I would like to learn more about Photograhy and Painting. I have same skills in drawing landscape but I have no idea about photography. Taking picture is a new experience for me. I have never been I California. How is the weather there in July? What kind of clothes would you recommend taking with me? Is it possible to pay by credit card or should I prefer to take traveller queckes? I am glad to hear from you. Yours faithfully Artemis  [SEP]  Hi Kim, How are you doing? I couldn't write  you because I was very busy. Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my town. I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hopped to see a lot of diffrent people. You know everybody has to cross this spot! Given the circumstances they asked my for helping in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out as a funny and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal. It means I had to read the recipies very carefully. And I had to controll that nothing will be missed. The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks. On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored. The people were all really funny and we were a good team. The time was quickly over and it was a great experience. And what about you? I am interested to hear about your new dog? Warm whishes Your friend, Artemis ",26.0
1233," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, as the leader of the conference-organisation, I'm glad if I can help you. My wish is that nothing goes wrong. So you have to know more details about our conference. Your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is placed in the city centre. As far as I know this hotel is very comfortable. There is also a subway-station near Palace Hotel. Our college is not much far away. You only have to take the subway-train. After three stations you have arrived  Brooklyn street. When you come out of the subway you see our college. The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock. The students have prepared a music program for the end-of-conference party. There will also be an international buffet. So don't eat too much before you come. And please don't worry about clothes. There are not any rules. In our city there is a big adventure swimming park. I think you should visit Water World on your last day. You will have a lot of fund, I can tell you. If you need any further information please call me. My number is: 793354 Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The telephone is a very important invention, which has affected our lives. It is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places. People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life. In my opinion people need a telephone. For example a telephone is very important in job-life. Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone. Also it is god for people's safety. You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured. The people use the telephone also for their personal life. For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away. Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone. They are able to give and receive informations very quickly. This invention has made our lives easier and quickier. The telephone has made my own life also easy and quick. It makes something possible you can not do. Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people. ",29.00
754," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you  the further informations you asked for: I only have two months of vacation that are July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July. I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you: Do I need to bring  particular clothing like a surfing suit, for instance? Is any ""pocket money"" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards? Best Regards Chi Chen  [SEP]  Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare. You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier. Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into more frustration and tiredness. So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.

1242," Neuchâtel, 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I thank you for your recent letter. First, I would like to congratulate  on your new responsability,  because of Mr Brown's illness. I give you with great pleasure all the details needed. Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly in front of the bus station. To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy. You have to take the bus number 1 and get off at ""Black House"", which is the third stop. After the conference, at about 8 pm. a party is organised. During it, everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference. Food and beverages will be available. After the cocktail, the Band ""Zero one"" is playing their famous songs. The clothes, required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women. Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to make a sightseeing tour in our city. I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Report on the ""Paintings Museum"" In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too. Location The museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the ""Delamuraz Hotel"". It is close to the main road, and at 300 meters of the station. Outside The building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to pas through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your swim suit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in  pools. Inside When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. There were all painting during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceilar. Everything in this room is about wine. To learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor. I particularly recommend you to visit the ""blue"" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door. According to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed. Conclusion To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself. You won't be disappointed. The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden. ",34.00
163," Dear Mister I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment: ""Over the Rainbow"". As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland, we apreciate to pass a week in London every year. We are keen on theatre and musical show. Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles. We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed ""The Drama"" you presented last year. Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. At first, we couldn't get any discount, although you mention it on your advertisment. And the only tickets left were at £20. Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration. Therefore I ask you to give use £20 back, because the two tickets were not more worth. I'm looking forward to hearing soon from you. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was following a course all the week in Berne. The kids were by their grandmother, who take care of them. I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't any swimming-clothes. I knew a good place. I parked the car and went ten minuts. As I had planed, the place was deserted. I took my clothes of and swam  twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too. Unfortunately a police car drove by and the policeman saw me standing there nude. They drove me to their office after having given me use of their shirt. There I called Pat who picked me up. I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me. Of course she told everything to my husband. If only Pat could keep secrets! ",30.0
899," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I have received a letter from you saing that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me. I would like to travel on July because my hollydays are only on it and the wheather in California is better . I am that kind of person who enjoy to have a wild and simple life, so I prefer to be accommodated in tents. About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball which I have a lot of experience . The second one is sailing, but I am not so good in this sport. I would like to know some more information about the Camp, before I left, which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me. Yours sincerely Augusto Roy  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How is everything? Is your dog better? Well here I'm very fine. I bought a new T.V., it's very big and I love it! In your last letter  said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I enjoy it very much, it was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be the responsable with  lights and sound. I told then that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job. The most increible part was the laser show. They were drowing a lot of things in the sky during the concert. Next time I'll take you and your friend Monica. I'm shure that you are going to love it. Please write back Love and Peace Augusto. ",21.0
864," Dear Ms Helen Ryan I write to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the travel that I have won in your competition. First of all, I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July. Because, I am a student and in June, I will still have school. Also, in Augost I will be studying a summer English course. In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent. Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every days comforts, in these two weeks. However, in your letter  is written some activities. I would choose Basketball and Tennis. Basketball I have been playing in a team, of my town for ten years. Also Tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice every week with my friends. Finally, I would be grateful to you, if you  told me about clothes and money. Will we need any special clothes and How much you would suggest me to carry for these two weeks? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Dear Kim How are you? I am very well I'm writing to explain my experience with the pop concert; last month. First of all, I think that I help them. Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert. I was going to markets  to schools and I was giving  information  when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or book a ticket for this concert. I know, It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed  a lot. Firstly, it was a good break from the  routine. Because I did it for  first time. Also, I felt wonderful when I saw, that the concert had  succesed and every day  was croweded. Because I believed that this was a result which came  with my help. I would like to do again it in the future. It was a fantastic experience. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes ",28.0
32," 2 Desember 2000 Dear Mrs Clark: I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added in next year's International Arts Festival, wich in my opinion has been a great idea to create. Although I have read that Starts and Artists came frome around the world, I have realised that they only came from only six countries. I spent a good time in the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personaly think that It would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films. The rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive, I think that  ticket was exellent for us because of its price. I look forward to hearing  you as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  2 Desember 2000 Dear Andy: I'm sorry I haven't written for so long, but I have been very busy with my exams. It's good to hear that you have passed all of them. In your letter you told me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion for your homework ?Don't you? You know that I'm studing in a hard school, and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework everyday. The other day I arrived five minutes late and the teacher ordered me to go home. ?Do you understand this? She might be crazy I have friends that are studing in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom. At home it's very different, as you know I have a very good parents that let me do a lot of things. they let me go out with my friends every day, but they make me do homework and I hate this!! I hope that it is what you wanted from me. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours ",34.00
1065," 1/3/2000 Dear Mr. Robertson. I'm a student in  English class which  going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm a representative student from my class  to thanks you about your programme that you've already organised for us. It's really wonderful especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel  can't wait until that time. However, the students in my class, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The show has many interesting parts such as  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study  Fashion and Design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion. So we think that it will be useful for all of us. Anyway, we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip. So we will have  free time on the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoy the show. I'm also include the show's leaflet on the back of this letter. What do you think about this plan? I'm looking forward to see your programme.  [SEP]  I believe that everyone in this world have curiosity. We're always want to know about others' life especially the famous one even the one that we hate. But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example when we get married or when  policeman stop us on the highway, we don't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us. Famous people are also the normal people like us just because their jobs are known by every people, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy. They also want to have  special time with their family or their friends. It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take their photographs and some journalists write the news that  not true. We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people. But it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time, they should give them some privacy. On the other hand, these stars should accept that they are famous people so everyone wants to know about their life. The best way is  they, the famous stars and the journalists, should compromise and respect each other's rights. ",32.00
703," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter. First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. It is very important for me, because I  always wanted to travel to the U.S.A. I would be able to travel only in July because it is the only month when I don't have to go to school. I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent, it would be a new experience for me. The two activities that I choose are: basketball and climbing. I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old. By the other side, I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it. I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take. I look forward to knowing the date of the camp. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it. As you know, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it. First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs. When the concert was finished, some friends and I went for a drink. It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, ",30.0
894," Dear Helen, I have received your letter this morning and I'm very happy for this first prize. It's a great opportunity for me participate in your Camp California because normaly I work a lot and I can't spend money to travel, moreover, I have to maintain my big family because I'm married and I have three children. I would like to travel in July because before  I have to work with my father because he's ill. For de accommodation I  prefer a long cabin because it's more comfortable. I recognise that I would like to sleep in a tent but in this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed. I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this time. I have to choose painting and the photography therefore. I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think in my helth. In your letter you explain me that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life in Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money. The weather I hope will be good so I suppose I have to bring short clothes. I'm very enthousiastic and I attend your answer as soon is possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In our society the money is one of the most important aspect to have power. If we thing about , we will realise that we need money all the day. Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of the activities. There are a lot of people who spend a lot of money because they like shopping. Sometimes, they have to buy something that they need but frequently, they buy  only to spend money. This is a big problem because a lot of families haven't money, however spend going shopping. We have to teach to our children the value of the money, to explain the difficulties  to earn money in a job, because we have to work eight, nine or ten hours a day, for example. It's a first step to educate the youngest and to help our society. The money is important but we have to know how to spend it: shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24.0
913," Dear Madam, I was very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition and it will be a good opportunity for me to go to the U.S.A. If it is possible, I would like to travel in July. I will be working until the end of June and I am going to start university in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because, in my opinion, it is easier to make friends and I like camping as well. I have chosen photography and climbing for  activities. I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in . I have a medium level  in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains. Can you tell me how much money I have to take, if I have to take winter clothes and if it is possible to rent a car there. Thank you for this opportunity. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  I like shopping. Some people when they are tired relax  spleeping, reading a book or watching television but not me. Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing. I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one in this case. There were always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent one hour in the shop whithout buying anything. However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles. In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children trying to walk in a warm and noisy place. In conclusion, you have to know when and where to shop quietly but in my opinion spending money in a crowded shop is the most enjoyable thing in the world. ",34.0

With this letter I would  ask you if you wuld change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The Show is  Tuesday, March 14th from 10.00-19.00 in the Central Exibition Hall. They  gona show a latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and new hairstyles. We all think that it would be a good opportunity to see this show. We are young and we all are interested in fashion. For the students it is free.

I knew that my brother was at home, althoug I didn't know where . I was doing my homeworks when I heard an explosion. I came out of my room and I saw my brother n fire. He was playing with fire and alcohol in the bathroom. My first reaction was to put him on the floor so that the fire could stop. He was screaming because he had  such a big pain. We were shocked, we all didn't know what to do. I called a taxi because my father wasn't able to drive. We went to the hospital and they cured him. He had to stay there for three long weeks. Since that bad experience he never playied with fire again. I really like my brother and I would do anything possible to save him. ",29.00
112," Dear Sir, I'm writting this letter to complain about your fake advertisement. You are the theatre's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain . First of all in your show advertisement  sais that Danny Brooks starts in the play. But a different actor has started and that was very disappointing not only for me but for all  people there. The show has begun later, much more later than your advertisement writes, at about 20:15. The show started 45 minutes later. This made me get bored. You also refer to your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any. At the end you have written that there is the theatre restaurant  after the show but there wasn't. It had closed because of the late start of the show. At the end because I; hadn't have a perfect evening but a very disappointing one, I have the right to ask  my money back.   [SEP]  Modern technology changed not only my daily life but also the life of many people. Now let's talk about me. First of all I don't have to worry n the morning  if I miss the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time. Usually When I return from school the food is a lit of bit cold so I put it in the microwave to become  hotter. When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch in my country especially in summer  is too hot. So I turn on the aircondition with  timer so when I get  sleep  to turn off by itself. When I wake up if I don't have homework I sit on my computer and play different games to spend my time. At the evenings before I got to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV through the sattelite. When I go to bed because there are many mosquitoss I turn on a special machine with  pile like thing in it which kills them. I belive that modern technology has effected possitive our lives. ",23.0
92," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to complaint about the musical show that  Circle Theatre company played  few days ago. Anything the advertisement said was correctly done. The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the beginning. It is a great fault of responsability for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one. Secondly, an other point that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role. He was not Danny Brook, and the main reason that I came to see this show was the possibility to see him acting. I am a fan of him. When I went to get the ticket, and the women said me that the discounts were not available I knew that it wouldn't be a good night. Finally, the restarant were I would like to have dinner with friends after the show was closed against what was announced in the advertisement. Nobody told us about the reasons of the problems. These are the reasons why I am complaining, and I would like to know if there will be some money back. I will be waiting  news from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Perhaps, modern technology has changed my life style but I don't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments. Since I was born I have lived involved of technological instruments like personal computers, mobile phones, television, etc. And the development of them doesn't worries me, like people  against technology. The only thing I can say about technology is that  has driven my life. Modern technology attracts my atention, and this is the reason why I have chosen an electronic caree. I think technology doesn't change the life style. Is the life style or necessities from people what make technology develop. All kind of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to don't waste so many time. But these ones bring new problems that must be solved by others. ",24.0
1151," Dear Maria, I've recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon, here yo have a little help for it. At first, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is ""The Palace Hotel"", wich is situated at the center of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because  is very near of the conference. Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel. At the end of the conference it will be a party. I might suggest you to wear a casual dress, because many students feels  relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference. The party is amazed by a group of musicians, and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven, because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun. It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially ""the History museum"" wich I visited last year, and I think you can enjoy  as well. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free. Whising I've been very helpful to you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIFES It's imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business. We can't imagine a big company without a phone, that can makes business more quickly than anything else. Also, I was asking too many people in the street. Could you live without  telephone? The answer was all the same ""Imposible"". An old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the ""Chicago University"", she told me that every night  was expecting a call from her son, for her was the line of the hapiness. However it was one persone wich he told me, it wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to writte a lot, especially at Christmas  to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion. In my opinion this little ""box"" that everybody has at home can safe your life, especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation. In conclusion don't make a very long phone calls and you won't have to pay a very expensive bill. ",23.00
97," 59 Gorham Drive St Albans AL1 2HW 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show of ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw on 15th of June in your theatre. Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20:15. As for the ticket price, you promised to provide discount tickets, but they were not available. Furthermore, when I went to the restaurant after the show, I found it was closed. Because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00. I do not need to tell , either, that I had  awful evening and you are responsible for that. So I am asking  to refund all the money. Thanking  for your prompt attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

For recent years, as Information Technology has been improved highly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not  same as before. A few years ago, I did not know what  Internet was, how to use it and so on. But, while those have been spread all over the world, I and all the other people who I have known became to use them. I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to  library. I am able to meet my friends quickly in  Internet  just clicking the mouse. In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who I want to talk  at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed. It is causing some changes to me. So, now I would rather send the e-mail than the letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster. ",29.0
117," JUN 17th, 2000 Dear MR SMITH, My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre. Last May, I had a week holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL SHOW. I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show. First of all, when I arrived, I met a note stuck on the front door that informed  about changes at  actor's staff. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were bad. Secondly, I want to tell you that the show started forty five minutes later. In order to the tickets, I want to say that they are very expensive. I had put some money aside for a month, thinking about the discount, but when I want to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible. To sum up, the restaurant was closed. I will appreciate  if you could send me my money back. Looking for your repley. Yours Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. That is why she could no be a spy. When she was a girl, Pat used to play spies and detectives games. Her mother gave  a book about how to become a spy for her birthday. She had watched all  Mission Impossible and gadget, the inspector series. When she finished the school, she went to study to the Agent Trainning Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc. She was the best student they have ever had. But things changed during her first mission. She was sended to New York to discover how some people from  government gave money to the merchants because they want to build a Trade Center there. At first she walked around the bayside market looking for all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different for the rest, talking with one of the sellers. Immediately she interrupted and told to the man that she was a secret agent. Obviously the man realised that she was looking for him and said that she was really crazy! You can imagine what had happened with her cover as a spy. ",26.0
671," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thanks a lot for your briefly and nice letter. I am very pleased to give you the information required: Firstly, the most suitable month would be in July because I am very busy in my work now, and my children are in holiday then. Secondly, I prefer to stay in log cabins, because they are more comfortable. I confess you that I have never been in a tent and till now I have never had the intention  to do it. The activities are really interesting and I would take part on Painting and Climbing. I am not very good  painting, but I like it because  is a good oportunity to practice it. Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body. I don't want to dissapoint you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges. I would appreciate  if you can tell me a couple of ideas about  clothes I  need there. Thanks in advance. Sincerely, G. Ramos  [SEP]  Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë Not only bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones, but also this take your attention. In this book, Heathcliff as a child hadn't a bad character but the situations  lived  with the family Earnshaw, where the grown up, made him rude, agresive and noisy. Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, brother of Catherine, hatted Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason he sent Heathcliff to work in the farm. In the mean time Catherine knew Edgar Linton and at the end she married Edgar because of  money and good education. Heathcliff promised  himself and worked his whole life  taking a revenge. Before Heathcliff died he riched what he wanted. The houses and money of the families Earnshaw and Linton, all belonged to him. and he was buried near to Catherine!, his great and only love! ",29.0
889," Dear Miss Ryan,  I am writing in reply to your letter, informing me that I have won the prize in your competition which is two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am really pleased to hear that the prize includes accommodation. I would like to stay in a tent, because I have been camping nearly every summer since my childhood and I really love it. I would be really happy if I could apply Singing and Photography as the activities you have written about. Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5. I could say that I am quite good at it. However, I used to assist my brother, who is a profecional photographer. So that, I consider myself expirienced enough. I would like to ask you whether going there in July is possible. I am afraid that July is the only appropriate month, because I am due to start work in August. Finally, I would like to ask you for further information about  spending allowance and the clothes which I am supposed to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry I haven't written for so long. But I've been quite busy just recently. Last month, I helped  at a pop concert which I really enjoyed. The singer, who took place, wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being  stuff there, was just amazing. I was just behind the stage. I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so that I could see all that screaming like made crowd. I even saw crying girls, who were trying to reach the pop-singer. Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly . I think you never realize this, until you're not a part of the crowd. But I'm really happy, that I had even  small role in making people enjoying themselves. I mean, all that flashing lights,  the changing colours of them, I believe they helped much. Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself being very successful. And finally, the greatest news. I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there. He was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit his signature on it. I suppose, I will never forget that night. That's about all my news, I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Lots of love, ",36.0
457," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to the musical show I saw last week in your theatre. I hoped that it would be the most excited evening during my week's holiday in London. Unfortunately it wasn't. I wouldn't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information. First of all, when I had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available. Secondly, I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone didn't excuse. Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook, which is my favourite actor, didn't play in the show. Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed. Finally, I must say that I had a very disappointing evening and I would like to get my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I wish I had know it two days ago... Exacly on 15th June we were at the birthday party. Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him. I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea. I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin. It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us. Yesterday I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony. I really regret that I was so foolish. The most horrible  is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I don't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties. ",33.0
719," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing  you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have. First of all I want you to know I am really happy about the prize. The only problem is that like I am a student I can travel only during  holidays, in July. Refering to accommodation I would rather to stay in  tents because I have never gone on camping so I would like to have the experience. I am not really keen on art that is why I  prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing. If I have to be honest, I would say I have never practised none of them. Yet, I would like to try them because my city is too far from the sea so I don't have many opportunities of doing them. I would appreciate  if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take. Besides, I wonder if I will share the tend or not and if I have to take it from here or if it will be provided by you. I am looking fordward to hearing from you. Yours Natalia Lorena Kraus  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't told you  the experience of the pop concert in detail in my last letter  was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now. As few months ago I chated, by  internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires, who happened to be one of the member of ""Los Pericos"". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They have to make a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me  where they were preparing the concert. The problem was that one of the technics was from England and nobody there spoke nor a word in English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English. I hope you are not angry any more after this letter. I'm looking fordward to hearing from you. love, ",32.0
344," To the manager of the Circle Theatre. I went to see Over the rainbow Show, Friday evening the 16/6. The musical had been advertised to be London's newest and best musical, but all to my disappointment. I had been looking forward to see my favorite  Danny Brook, but he had been replaced by some other actor. I was not too happy about that and why didn't the theatre start when it was suposed to start? (45 min late), and where were the discounts which were  available? Your advertisement was ful of false advertising. In the end of the show I was looking forward to have a nice dinner in the restaurant together with my boyfriend, but it was closed, because you were short of staff. This was not my perfect evening out. I want to have at least half of my money back. I hope you preciate my letter and that you'll try to improve the disadvantages./ Sally Svenssen  [SEP]  How has modern technology Changed my daily life? The modern technology like  internet for example has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways. The advantages with  internet are that I can do all my shopping from  internet. I don't have to stress around in the supermarket  a friday evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the groseries I need delivered to my door. Instead. I buy all my clothes on  internet as well and it works brilliant, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with  internet too. I don't get as much exercise as I used to get. Nowdays I spend 2 hours intent of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people. I have got friends over the whole world now. I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my internetfriends. The modern technology open new and exciting ways for us. I don't think that I had been going to Japan if it wasn't because of  internet. Internet has opened  a whole new world to me.

You can find futher information from me about Camp California in the USA. First of all I should go to Camp California only  July because I will start working in our local leisure centre as a swimming instructer  And I would like to  swimming  activities at the camp. My second chose is painting because I love water colour painting and I am a member of the our water colour painting club in my town. I would like to stay in  log cabins because I have bad experiens about tents. I do not like to stay in such a small place. Lastly, I would like to know how much money I should bring with me and could you give me  clue about what I must bring as a clothes and what I do not need it. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping is Not Enjoy Anymore We are all costemers of the big supermarkets They have all what we need it. They are a bit far from town but they have huge car park. They give us lots of chose to buy what we need it and what we can try for. Also they give lots of sale for everything even you can join their club for extra discount. It look wonderful does not it. But when we thing   properly shopping is not enjoyable for example if you forget something that  need for  salat. You have to go back  this supermarket and find  nearest parking space then before someone takes the their last fresh lemon for your salat you must find  where was the lemon section before because they love change the store  again and again. When you get your lemon you have to go to queue to lemons money. At it shows shopping is become  our dislikes, because of the huge supermarkets. ",23.0
209," Dear MANANGER of the theatre I'm writing just for the reason, to inform you how bad became the present , name ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". First of all in the describing of the show, the starring sould be Mr. DANNY BROOK, and it wasn't. Another thing was the started time , the show started forty five minutes late. So try to imagine my situation, I had paied a lot of money and I couldn't saw a good show, I am really disappointed. When the play ""over the Rainbow"" finished I tried to eat something, but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed, because your personal were cleaning all the troubles that a old dog did. But, the principal reason of this letter is to ask for some money back. I think that could be the best for everyone, and I'll like to give you an advice, if somebody pay you for a ticket, try to give the best you can. Hope hearing from you.  [SEP]  Unfortunatety, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, I'm going to tell  about my grandfather and his friend Pat: Many years ago, more or less seventy years  a young man with a exellent capacity of thinking and to invent materials things, started building a big thing called  ""time machine"". He worked day and night. Every day after having dinner Pat, his best friend, and my grandpa met to talk about their problems, but my Grandpa never told Pat about his new project. One month later, his worked was complete, but he was afraid of testing his machine, so he called Pat and spoke   about it. The only thing Pat should do, was to choose a date, the one he likes and to press the starter botton, and you know, what, he did it! The machine worked really good. The fact was that Pat choose to go to the year 2000, and when he arrived, he told every one that he was the inventor. That's why Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. THE END. ",25.0
679," Hello, Firstly I would like to thank you for your prize. This travel enjoys me because I never go to  USA. Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only  July because I study in an ingenior's school in France and in Summer we have  holidays since July. I prefer to live in tents, where it is easier to make contacts with other people than in log cabins. When I travel I don't often sleep in  hotel, I prefer tents and also I can meet people, who lives in the country. For the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. That is a sport that I always want to practise but in France it is to expansive. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to fail it. I would like to photograph  too. There are so much monuments in California and so I will remember these holidays with my photographies. Could you send me more informations about  clothes to take with ? Finally I would like to ask you, if I need some money because you say all accomodation and travel costs are paid for. Thank you for your answer. Charles Dumaux  [SEP]  Hello Kim, Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was marvellous!!! I was in the backstage, so I could speak with the singer before the concert. During half an hour he explained  me, how he feel in France. I had to serve glasses of water to the group before and during the concert, so I had a lot of contact with them. They are very gentle. After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium, where they had played. What I particularly liked about this experience is that I saw that famous people are like us and have the same interest. I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps in the next concert we will go together. I will give you news about it. I hope you will answer my letter and say me if you are interesting in my proposition. I send you with my letter a photo of the singer, what he give me. See you later. Charles ",26.0
105," Sir, Madame I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. But I was not very satisfied after my ""perfect evening"" out. The advertisement for the Musical Show was very good, but the information was not correct. You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing. In the advertisement  was written that the show will start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later, at 20.15! Because of the advertisement I thought that I can   discount  the tickets available but I couldn't. After the show I need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved, but it was closed. And there was no reason why . So you can see that it was not a so perfect  evening for me then I thought. Now I hope that you can understand my question for some money back because of the trouble I had.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secretes. This was the only reason why that she had not  a lot of friends. When Pat  came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few time the others have seen that Pat can't keep secrets. So they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important. Sometimes it finished like this that the others only said: ""Hello, how are you?"" and then went away without listening  the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams were coming. She dreamed about good friends,  time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets. Then one day she met this person. It was Katha, a girl who had the same problems like Pat. So they found both the person they dreamed from. ",25.0
518," Dear Sir, I would like to complain about the show which you presented on last saturday. It was such  disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week's holiday in London. We have had a quite pleasant time except  the evening. Actually it spoiled our time. So I would like to get back our money. These are some points I want mention about the differencies between  the advertisement said and the realities. First, I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role, but he had never shown up that night. The main actor was an unknown actor. It was a such disappointing. Second, it started only at 20:15. It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be. It was a such boaring to wait  the show in a noisy and hot theatre. Third, there was no possibility of  discount. The girl  sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mention about  the discounts availability was written in the advertisement. Forth, the theatre restaurant was closed. There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend. How could you arrange work like that? Finally the sentence  was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true. It was  most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced. I wish that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need give back the money we paid. Sincerely Yu Phu Tung.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me. First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite  long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even  I could meet some friend, but I couldn't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language were different. I really wished to have a friend  can share everything  is going  in our lives. Finally I met Pat. She was a such wonderful person in our class. She tried to help others when they have  difficult time at school. One day she realized that I was always been outside of  circle. One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in  weekend usally. We had a fantastic time together for three monthes. Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books. I thought that I  found a good friend in my life. So I told her everything about my life. There were some stories I never told anyone before, but I had share with her all my secrets. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Few days later I told her about my secret love story, it became a top gossip among my classmate. It was a nightmare! ",14.0
226," Dear Madam or Sir, During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the ""Circle Theatre"". The show was called ""Over the rainbow"" and should be, in refer to the advertisment, London's newest and best musical show. But I was very disappointed. I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook to someone else I was very disappointed. Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should  begun at 19:30 but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you have mentioned some discounts in your advertisment, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student. Even your theatre restaurant was closed for repairs. The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment was the complete opposite and that is what I want to get some money back from you. I am looking forward to an early answer. Yours faithfully Herman Ruter  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I have been friends for a long time. We have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests. When we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent. I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know  that. Pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose. Two days later my father asked me whether I had thought at any time  to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard  that from some parents of my friends at school. He told me  two hours what could happen if I would do that. I was very surprised because Pat and I were along when we decided to do that. The next day Pat told me that he wanted to be admired by some girls and so he had to tell them our secret. I felt very disappointed in this moment but I have learned something new about humans;  is  you can only trust yourself. Pat and I have still been good friends but we have never had an other secret together. ",30.0
78," Dear Ms Jane Clark. I am writing to you with regard to the International Art Festival that was held recently. The festival was excenent in many ways, and especially it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with  proper price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic. However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars   participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year. I hope that next year's festival will be much more successful that this year's one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'. Above all, realistic stories teach me something of the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up  taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways. In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read  other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives. We all learn from reading books, but realistic stories have more influence on me and develop my personality. That's why I prefer realistic stories to unusual ones. ",34.00

I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while I am there, because of my studies, I will take painting as this is the subject which I am finishing at the College, allways with important cualificaitons, and photography subject which has been my hobby since I discover that I can mix in practise paint and photo. Concernet to acomodation. I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or and excurcion it won't be the same if I slept in a cabin.

Some people seems to enjoy going shopping and spending money, it makes them happy but what about the ques you have to make to pay for something just to realise, when you get to the front, that they have to close that till and they ask you to move to the next till, what a waist of time. It happened to me once that I wanted to go on holidays, so I went to the travel agency. in the front there were some good advertisement about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them concernent to Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, but for £250. I went inside to asked for that packet but they told me that it was gone, therefore, I went to many shoops just to find the same answer. any of the adver. in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that adver.  of the   didn't do it. As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours, and don't waist your time asking for promosion advertised in the windows of the shop. ",24.0

402," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show. I am a student in Liverpool, and recently I had a week's holiday in London. First day in London, I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me. But I was really disappointed  it. First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement. Also, it was certain to me  to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student. But, it was not availiable. Second, I went to the theatre  exactly seven thirty in the evening. However the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted time too much for waiting. It was not good to me, cause I had only one week holiday in London. Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word ""Stuff vacation"" on the front door after the show. It was absolutely different from your leaflet. On the whole, I was really disappointed at that time. Could you do me my half of money back. I enclose my phone number and address. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Lo Son Lin.   [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Have you ever seen the film star wars? And did you notice something about fashion of the future? I think the people will wear convenient clothes with  simple design in the future. Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer. And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk. However, if they have some special day when like  important public day or special day of their life, they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you  never seen before. Some of that will be very strange to our eyes, but some of  others will be familiar to us. And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc. Maybe some peoples are nakid. It will be very interesting... Just imagine the way of future people's life. And you can see the their clothes also.  ",21.0

Therefore it'll be a great experience for me. I'd like to choose swimming and photography as activities. I go swimming three times a week so I have no problem with swimming. I'm also the member of  photography club at my university and really keen on taking a picture of nature. By the way, I'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should prepare and how much much I should bring with myself. I'll look forward to hearing answers from you. Yours faithfully, YEUN-Ja. HONG  [SEP]  The suggestion about making a short video. Introduction The aim of this report is to summerize the result of the survey, which is about making a short video. The survey was done to 300 students, who are between 18-28, at our school. Prefered lessons. The 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students, attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active. Additionally, 15% of students answered  they want the presentation lesson to be filmed. The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn of presentation does his or her best. Prefered activities. The soccer game, played every Monday, was ranked in the most favorite activity by 45%  students. They said the soccer game enable them to get together and have fun. However, the girls'd rather play table tennis or badminton. Hicking activity was chosen by 20%  students, followed by the soccer. Conclusion. To sum up, according to the survey, it's obvious that more than half of  students want  acting lesson to be filmed. Moreover, it seems that the students prefer the soccer play to be filmed. ",25.0
1201," Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information. We have already booked a 4 stars hotel -  Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames. It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train. The end-of-conference party will be held in an India restaurant, that is next to the hotel. It is surposed to be held during 7 pm to 11 pm. Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and  disco is also provided. You can wear anything you like, we would like you to be just yourself and have fun. As you know, our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year. There are so many things to do, unfortunately, there is just 3 hours. I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping. So you can buy gifts for your friends or families. I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts, please do not hestitate to contact us. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, our lives is becoming better and better. Lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely. If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television. ""Televisions is just an amazing invention."" My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are the other countries like, or even what language they speak unless we go to that country. Secondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as ""Learn follow me"" and ""Be good to others"". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child. The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't. If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, that's easy,  just turn on the television and enjoy myself. However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I do think televisions is the most important invention. ",32.00
943," Dear Sir, Thank you for your letter and for having inform me about the results of the competition. I also want to congratulate you for your exellent competition, thank to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go . About the travel, I think it would be preferable to do it on July, which is a holiday periode and so I won't have any special obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can live closer to the nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do, specialy during a trip! Moreover  would like  if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful. Before ending my letter I would like to know and be told specialy in what kind of clothes should I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine in Dollars. I look forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you know last month I went to help at a concert, the one that I told you  in my last letter. I wanted to go very much there and so go there for helping was for me a unique chance. Moreover instead of bying a ticket I entered there for free, as a helper. From the first time that  went there I understood that I was going to have a great night. OK in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do, so as cleaning the stage and so some decoration work. But as the correct started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do what ever we wanted. So the party started... The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun. Don't ask the time in which I come home because I don't remember! Some of my friends who were also helping told me that we returned at six o'clock in the morning! It was really an unforgettable experience. Best whishes Giannis ",25.0
1122," Dear Mr Robertson, We would like to thank you for all the time you have spend for us in order to organize the programme that we should follow during  three days that we are going to spending  London. We all believe that  is a great programme which concludes both education and free time. We would like to inform you that we notice an advertisement for the London fashion and Leisure Show. This show is going to take place in the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday, March 14 between the hours 10.00-19.00, and we would like to ask you if it is possible to go to that show. We think that  is a great opportunity and we are all very interesting  to go because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, lot  kinds of make up and some of the famous hairstylers. The show is absolutly free for students. As a class we suggest to go to this show on Tuesday, March 14  morning and to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon during our free time. If that of course is possible. We  all like to thank you again.  [SEP]  In the year 2000  media is one of the most powerful things on the planet. The media is everywhere, televisions, radio stations, newspapers,  magazines all have one goal, to inform the citizens. Some of them, however are not doing their job probably. They don't inform people about news, education or documentaries. They just published gossips about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars. I believe all the people famous or not, deserve to have  private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us with their problems, their good and bad times and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right. And good for his pocket. I think the only way of change that is, the people, If the people shows no interest  the journalist would have no goal of publish any gossips because  is not going to be watch or read by anyone. So the power is to the people. ",29.00
127," DEAR SIR I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN FOR THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE. FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE BROCHURE. IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG! I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT THE ACTOR WAS NOT THE ONE YOU WROTE  I DISCOVERED THIS ONLY WHEN THE PLAY STARTED, AND IT WAS VERY LATE! SECONDLY, AS I WROTE BEFORE, THE PLAY STARTED LATE, AND FOR ME IT WAS TERRIBLE TO WAIT FORTY FIVE MINUTES. THIRDLY, I WAS VERY EMBARASED TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NOT DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE. FINALLY I COULDN'T EAT TOO. IN FACT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED, VERY FAR FROM MY THOUGHTS. FOR THESE REASONS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK. BECAUSE FOR ME IT WAS NOT A ""PERFECT EVENING OUT"". I AM SURE THIS LETTER WILL RECEIVE YOUR PROMPT ATTENTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU. YOURS FAITHFULLY  [SEP]  UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS. THIS WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS FOR HIM. SO MANY TIME HE WAS TOLD: ""PAT I  SAY THIS SECRET ONLY TO YOU"". PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY  FEW DAYS, AFTER  THE SECRET COME FROM THE DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID. THIS WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP: HE ALWAYS LOST HIS FRIENDS. HE WANTED TO DIE FOR THIS. THE WORST THING IS THAT HE COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS BEHAVIOUR. ONE DAY THE FORTUNE HELPED OUR POOR PAT. ON THE BUS HE SAW A ROBBER WHILE HE WAS STEALING A WALLET, HE WANTED TO SCREAM, BUT HE WAS ASTONISHED. WHEN THE ROBBER UNDERSTOOD HE COULD BE DISCOVERED  HE SAID ""IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE SECRET I WILL KILL YOU"". PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED. EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVE AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS. ",26.0
10," Dear Mr. Clark, I'm a italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea because it's a possibility to see and to love the art, but, I think also there are some things thas could be changed. I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world. This choice doesn't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself. Some concert halls were too small and often people couldn't see the performances. There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films. Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people. The very about young people, the choice to offer a reasonably-priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art. I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people. Thank you and greetings.  [SEP]  I think a good way to get money it's work in a fast-food . Maybe the first impression isn't positive but from my personal experience, I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money. For six months I've worked in a McDonald's restaurant in Italy and I've got lots of money. I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food  you can work part-time, four, three, six hours every day. It depends on what you need. This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study. If you work in a fast-food  you can work in the afternoon, or during the night and so you have time for yourself. In the staff you can also find young people and getting fun with them during the work. What do you want more? If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that. ",28.00
803," Dear Ms Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter  2nd of March. I am writing to give you some information about myself. I am very keen on joinning Camp California in the U.S.A. I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this travel only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August. I m always been intents when I went with the university camps so I  prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in there. According to your activities at the Camp, I would choose singing and painting because I am a lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity. Also painting is my hobby because I have always been painting when I have a spare time. I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and How much money I should bring. Once again, thank you for giving me a good opportunity. I look forward to going with your camp in the near future. Yours sincerely (THONGCHAI ENPHENO)  [SEP]  Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable because of different reasons and places. In the first place, some housewifes don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you   forget to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore! Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want. Sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no  your size left. I cannot imagine anything worse. The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay  everything  buy  credit card. When a bill comes to £1000, you would be shocked and regret what you had done. In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully. ",31.0
162," Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spent the hole  last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" was (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city. But from the beginning we found a lot of problems. Despite we are actors we had to pay  a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you  the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show. I am waiting  your answer,  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life. Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic. Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space. Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of  Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays, and send my work to the office everyday. ",35.0
664," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing this letter to tell you the informations you need and to ask you one or two questions. I would like to come in july because I work in a big company where you have to take your holiday in this month. For the accomodation at Camp California, I will prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case it has a big storm with a heavy rain it's more resistant than a tent. For the activities, I chose climbing because I took  cours during 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level , for the other one I chose photography but I am not a proffesional, I just take some pictures in my holiday! I have a little question, could you tell me if and how  money I need to take with me, and which kind of clothes? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writing this letter to tell you  my good experience at a pop concert, last month. When I came, I was a bit afraid because I did not know what I had to do, but a very nice girl told me that my first job was looking for people whose felt bad and to guide them to the nursery. I did that  two hours , this first job was sometimes a bit boring but I felt like someone who save people, so I was really happy! My second  was to take the money at the bars and to bring them in a little room where I could see the pop star walked in the corridor. I was very excited when I could see a star! The next weekend I have an appointment with one  them, but I don't tell you the name because you'll fell jalous! Maybe I will tell you on the next letter! See you soon Best wishes ",25.0
233," Dear sir, I'm writing to you, to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", that I came to see during my holiday in London, at your theatre. Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected. First of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show. And I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking  part. And the worst  was that he wasn't so good in his role! Another thing was that the show I went to was  starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they  were waiting for too long, And I absolutely agree with them. Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show, to eat some thing or to have a drink. But when I went there, it was closed. I don't know why and I'd like you to tell me, the reason. Finally, you said that it would be our perfect evening out. Well it wasn't and I ask for my money back. I'd like you to return them to me. I'll wait to hear from you soon...  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So, the next day Pat went and told to his sister Sally that her friends were organising a suprise party for her birthday. When Sally heared that,  was very suprised and very excited. But because she didn't want to disappoint her friends, she was acting as  she didn't know anything. She let them to organise it! But although she was acting like this she was very ungry with her brother Pat, because he didn't keep the secret. The party was on Saturday at Sally's house. All her friends were going to meet there, while she was at her swimming lesson. When that day arrived they all went there as they planned. When the clock showed 8:00 they hide themselves under the tables and the  furnitures. After a while the bell rang. It was Sally! Suddenly they all shouted ""suprise!"". Sally although she knew  it, she seemed very suprised! So her friends didn't understand that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the suprise party had   succeed! But although Sally knew about it, they had a really great time. They danced a lot and they had pizza for dinner. It was an unforgetable night!!! ",30.0
1119," Dear Mr. Robertson, As we have seen the advertisment of the programmed the school set for us as a farewell activities, we are very appreciate and would like to thank  for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class which we hardly done it before. However, on the March 14, there is the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is also interesting for us. As you know all of us in this class are preparing to go in for the art & design school in the next semester. So this is a great oppotunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will have a fashion show, a demonstation from make up artists, and a contest for hair stylist. Furthermore, most of the famouse brand of sport were companies will join in this exhibition with their new product for the coming season. We would like to know if all of us can join in this event. We all agree that we are going to join the school trip to  Science Museum, which is the most interesting trip for us. Anyway, intstead of go shopping in the afternoon session, we will attend the show. This is the solution that we all think it will be the less effected to the other students, as the school do not need to re-arrange all the trip just because of our special interesting. We hope  much that you understand, and would like to thank  in advance for your cooperation. We looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I had never wanted to be a hero It was dangerous, but I know I had to do it.

It seemed that all of them didn't have any sympathy to that lovely blue eyes puppy that somebody who have no mercy just left it there, in a highway. If you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got off  the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side. It was true that small dog were in danger, but your life was in that situation as well once you decide to do that brave thing. All my body was shaking, and I would almost have turned back to my car if I didn't here that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner. So I just crossed the road, and jumped, picked him up. I feel like I was a hero at that moment, even though I'd never though of it before. ",24.00
301," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to you to complain about the musical show, wich everything was completely different from the advertisement. Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains I can start with the actor -  was a different one , not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous, but him I think he is a ""street actor"" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that drove me mad. I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for  discount ticket, I could not get it, it was really unfair, I paid  normal price. Also there was another problem, I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not,  was closed because it has been refurbished and redecorated. Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out however I had just a terrible time, everything went wrong. The only thing to do is: to compensate me, send  my money back, I am sending my ticket for that: Hope you'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Márcia  [SEP]  ""Techno life"" Twenty first century - technology, technology, and technology.

Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny. There is  ambiguity about technology -  can bring good things and terrible things as well. One good side is  making life easier - computer, mobile phones, vending machines, etc.... The bad side is   to use tecnology for war - missiles, weapons, etc....

Please check your times because many people had to leave at the middle of the show. - When the musical finished I was terrible hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open.

In on hand we have the advantages the new technology permits you  many things like fly, see in the dark, or  even save your life when you are almost dead. But in the other hand we have the disadvantages. The technology makes your life easier but, until when? For example, the car was developed by the modern technology, it makes your life easier but also  ""dangerous"". Why? Because too many cars mean too much CO2 in the air. And all people know that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kind of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give  and permit you  may things wich would be impossible in other times but also gives you many problems. ",29.0

Last Saturday I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show. I appreciated him a lot. When the show started forty-five minutes later, I realised that the main actor had been changed. That change really disappointed me. Another problem was that I didn't have any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five persons. Our idea after the show, was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed. Nobody could give me an answer. I really had an awful evening. Please send me a letter, with the explanations for all these problems that I told you .

We went upstairs with only a candle, and the idea of planning something crazy. Manuel had a farm, no so long from the town, where we could do whatever we wanted. But what was the problem. We were too young to stay a hole weekend alone. I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had  a camping with the school. We were all agree. We were going to spend a weekend alone, with nobody else, playing football, going to bed at the time we wanted, talking about girls. It was perfect.

229," Dear Mr Smith, I'm terribly sorry but I would notice you about a very disappointing evening. I'm sure you'll read this letter, with the intention of explaining the problems  had during the musical show of his theatre. One of the causes of my disappointing was the different actor that played  the show. I like very much Danny Brook, and his unaspected absence caused on me a big sadness. Then,  musical show had to start at 19,30..why at 20:15 there was also the light on? You'll be agree with me that 45 minutes to waiting for the starting of the show is a too long time. The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and  open restaurant after the show but it wasn't in this way. The restaurant was closed 'cause of illness.. of who? It's  strange thing! For those reasons I ask you for some money back, sure of my good reasons. Greetings  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It's for this reason that now I'm in this terrible situation. I can't believe she said that, I was at the Maria's party and 'cause of my distraction, I said Pat that I had lost the Jon's shirt. I was agree to buy another one, of the same style, but now he's angry with me, 'cause I didn't say anything to him. I don't know how to do. He's my best friend and so he wanted from me all the truth I can give him. It's all right, but I also think that he's too exagerate. I don't think  of having done  a so bad thing  to broke our friendness. I feel sad and shocked. I like his company, and we are happy when we are togheter.

With reference to the date, I only can go on July, as I'm going off on holiday on August, and I start university on September. The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more confortable than in a tent. It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities. The ones I'm most keen on are Tennis, in which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and Painting, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems. I think I'm not bad at painting either, at least everyone in my family likes my work, includying myself.

So, I have some opinions to this, which I would like to tell. First of all I think people have to be careful in the things that they buy because probably  are not a good quality, this is very annoyed. Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and don't spend it in the thing that they don't need because by the end of the month they won't have  money. Finally I think the product of the shops are in a good quality and reasonable price, but sometimes the staff of the shop is not very friendly with you, I think is not very nice to buy the thing there, with these people.

922," Dear Madam, With regard to your letter, I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible such a wonderful event as your competition is. If it was possible id prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July. In August I'll be working, so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month. About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp. My two activities chosen from the list are climbing and surfing. My skills in these activities are very different: while in climbing, this will be the first time I climb. In surfing learning won't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old. It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me. Yours sincerely Gil Sanchez  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not having written  you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting  you has been the accummulation of exams during this month. Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did you know I'm one of them? There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers. During the two hours of concert we had to attend  thirty-six people, who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! It's the best thing you can do in this case. Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon. Lots of love.

231," DEAR ""CIRCLE THEATRE"" MANAGER, I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRIME MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS  DIFFERENT  , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15! AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE WHOLE PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I HAD INTENTION TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. EVENTUALLY, YOU PROMISED ON YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT HAD NOT BEEN SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON, BEST WISHES  [SEP]  FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS. BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPES; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) STYLISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE  OPPOSITE FROM ANOTHER. I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOPE ACCORDING TO VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE YET NOW, OR A MORE FANTASCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPEMENT. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV, AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCALIZED ON COMFORTABILITY MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIOUS  CATHEGORY. ",31.0
384," Circle Theater To Mr. Smith, Circle Theater's manager 20th June 2000 Dear Mr Smith, By the following, I would like to inform you that I've assisted your new musical show,  which name is ""Over the rainbow"", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing  you to make a complaint on your advertisement, which I consider like a lying advertisement. Let me explain  you why I'm now so disappointed. I've spent one week holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had preparred  quiet a long time ago, this travel to the capital and spared a lot of money as well. We are both very keen on musical shows. We've already attended ""Cats"", the ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""les Miserables"", ""Grease"", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet  mentionned ""London's newest and best musical show"", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets. On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found  very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more  that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To International Post magazine Application for the shopping trip to New York Dear Sir or Madam, Please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner actually how the people are dressing to see how it's going to be developped into the future. Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday  was wearing broken-jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models,  medias, or new collection, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive that's  maybe not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex everything possible, in a way to create  own clothes. In my opinion, I think that people will wear no clothes anymore, just being natural,  nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity. I wish that my article comes in your magazine. With Best regards. ",24.0
658," Dear Sir/Madam First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your care about your customers. I was absolutely threaled to resive  news about my win in a competition. Your letter contains  few questions about  detailes of my holiday which I would like to clarify for you. The first is  time. I am only able to go on holiday in July, because the other time I have college, which I can't be missed. The second is accommodation. I old rather prefer stay in log cabins than live in tents. I don't like night cold and moscitos. I  so glad, that I will get  chance to do activities in the camp. I play basketball and at tennis. I  quite good at tennis. What about basketball is. I played in  school team, and was one of the best players by the end of this season. There is one more thing which I would like to know about. It is  clothes and money. Should I have any special , if yes what kind of wear it is. And of course there will be expenses. Can you inform me how much money should I have and can I have some information about prices  to visit local places of interests. At the end I would like ones more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all  detailes about  holiday. Yours faithfyly  [SEP]  I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it. In my opinion, it dependes on your mood, your financial ability, off course where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy. Usualy people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you  tide, you had  row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping. And what  you have. There are huge queus to  tills, noise, hussle, poor custumer service. You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought. For example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varaity of products, different prices, different quality. You should walk miles around  store to find what you wanted. Yes, there is  big plus for  big store of course. You can find everything in one place, instead of small shops which is specialised on one product. And people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something. Nower days tecnical progress gets close to us, to usual custumers.  Internet is one of the issue at this problem. Without any hussle, seating in your chear in front of your computer you in  second can get in at any shop who has  internet site, most of the big companies have it, get all  information about  product, get  cheaper price and buy it.

22," 16.12.00 Dear Clark, I am writing to response to the international Arsts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you, that it was a great idea and  valuable activitie as a social event. However, it was a dissapointment, when I realised that not many countries were attending to the event. I could be fine if I had seen more countries from all around the world, for instance:  far east, indonesia etc. It wasn't complicated to find the right hall to the shows, I should say it was very well organised. But one thing, I have to mention is that some of the concert halls was too small and it wasn't comfortable as well as to fell the great atmosphere. On the other side, I enjoyed to being on of the people to see the plays and films,  dance shows which was brillantly performed -  art exbitions. Listening  talks by the famous writers was a opportunity which I couldn't missed. I would like to ask, if you could expend the plays and films more for next year? I have to add that the weekend ticket was a ideal idea to sell all the events. Finally, I preciate your organisation and look forward to hearing from the next International Arts Festival.  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Nico, Its really nice to hearing from you and thank you very much for the letter with photos. Its a good idea to send them to me, because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films. What a pitty! By the way how is your new school? Did you like it more than the previous one? I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have  more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons. On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol. I have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks. My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up! But in many Families women are doing more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together. Anyway it think that's it for now. I hope to hearing from you soon. Lots of Love ",24.00
31," Dear Jane Clark, I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you have organized. I enjoyed it very much and I think you have had a great idea. I went to all the events, they were really good. I liked all the stars and the artists who came from around the world, even if the number of countries was very little, only six. Why don't you let more countries to participate next year? I also liked the concerts. But, can I give you a suggestion for next year? Try to find bigger halls, because this year they were really too small! I enjoyed all the plays and films, but they were fewà why don't you broadcast more at  next Festival? I also went to the dance shows, the art exhibition and the talks by writers, they were really very nice and interesting. I also agree with you about the ticket's prize. In fact, it was really a reasonably-priced ticket, excellent because you could go to all the events only with it. And that's the reason because lots of people came. An admiree  [SEP]  Capua, 16/12/2000 Hi Jane, how are you? I received your letter yesterday, and I want to answer you soon! I think the discussion in your class was very interesting. In my country there are different rules at school, but I think they are, more or less, the same in England. You have to begin your lesson at 8.25 and wait for the teacher of the next lesson in the class. You have a break of ten minutes, that you would have to do in class. You can't speak during the lesson or outside the classrooms. You can't write on walls and desks.. I have some rules also at home, but they are few. I can do everything I want, except going out with the car during the night. My parents are afraid of it because I took my licence only in September. My parents also like eating all together, but it isn't a rule, only an habitude! I don't think there is something I'd like to change! I like my life, both at school and at home! Write to me soon ",29.00
67," 16.12.2000 Dear Jane Clark, I went to the ""International Arts Festival"" on 21-22 November. The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for the next year's festival. Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries. I suggest you to increase this number for the next year. By this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will point on is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year?  Last thing that I will say is ""one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"". It was  very good idea. I hope you will make the same thing next year. These are the my suggestions. I hope you will listen  my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year in the festival.  Sincerely  [SEP]  16.12.2000 Dear Emily, I'm glad to see your letter. I'm fine thanks and my parents are also good. How are you and your parent? I' hope they are both well. I have a suprise for you. I will go to  this summer. May be we can meet there... You asked some questions about  rules in school and homes Let me answer this question. In schools we aren't allowed to speak in classes. Also we must go to school by our uniforms. However we are allowed to eat,  drink during the breaks. All the time we must be kind to our friends and teachers. We mustn't forget the books for the classes. These are the rules in school. In our home there are some rules too! I must be in home untill 11pm. I am not allowed to listen  high volume music at home. I must be kind to my brother and my parents. When the guests come to our home, I must be clear. Other things are allowed to me. I want to change  school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want.  Other rules are O.K. I want to hear some rules from you. Next time write the letter quick! I don't want to wait another 2 months. I'm waiting for your next letter. Take care and be careful not to break any rules. Your friend ",25.00

You had never made on your  own decision, you always had to ask your family's opinion. I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I was saving my pocket money to go to the theatre  age  15. During the this years I had met with Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning while I was going to school. Despite of  going to school by bus  easier than riding  bycyle I had prefered to going to school by bycyle to  by bus. In that way I had been able to see her every morning. The more seeing her I could, the more ambitious I became. At last I met wit her. She had invited me  her play to the theatre. When I went to her play to see, I  realy would love to be a actress. She was the only person who encourage me to be a actress. I had had a exam for  being theatre players without saying my family. Otherwise my father could kill me and not let me to go to school. I would never ever go to school again. Despite of the preparing  the exams, I had been continue  to my school regularly. Now I am a theatre actress. It was my dream I wish my dady ",7.00
721," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all thank you very much for the good news that I have won the first price in your competition. I am very delighted and already looking forward to spending two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.. As regards the time that I can travel I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July. I hope that it wouldn't be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July. I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergie against grass. Then you asked  to chose two activities from the list you sent to me. I would like to do surfing and photography. I am a total beginner in both activities, but I think that these two weeks will be a good opportunity to learn something about them. Finally I have also some questions to you. Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any possibilies for cooking. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable' If you have to go shopping again, because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes, a lot of time, patience and straingth are needed. All kinds of shopping have more and more become to a rather stressful activity than an enjoyable on. I often begins with finding a parking for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes. Leaving the car at home is also not a good ideas  you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic-bags. The next stressful factor begins in the shop: Everywhere people who are in a hurry and push you from one side to the other. Consuming has become a very important thing for them. And if you are not quick enough they won't leave  anything left. But there occure also problems if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive. Having finally decided and got what you wanted to, the next torture comes at the cash-desk, when you have to pay. You have to wait at a long queue for more than 15 minutes. So even if it's nice to have food or new clothes at home, without patience, time and straingth you should better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping. ",31.0

1035," Dear Mr Robertson, Many thanks for the programme you have organised. It is really interesting and diversity at the same time. There is just one thing I want to tell you; Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show. That is in the central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is only about fashion:  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students (what is really good). It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to go in. And, as you know we all are interested in fashion. In my opinion, I would suggest to go to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or, going to the show on wensday morning and on the afternoon, we can choose between free time or  National Art Gallery. I look farward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I went out of the room, ran as much as I could and started thinking  what this man was doing here and who he was. When I arrived in the street it was dark,  windy, but I could see a shadow at the corner of the opposite street. By the time I arrived here, he has disappeared. Suddenly, I felt very tired and decided to go home. My sister was standing, crying and showing the front door. I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her. I finally realized that she was dead. The police arrived twenty minutes later, took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder: lucky, the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him. They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside. Everything was going on, when one day, I came in the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her. ",25.00
203," To the manager, Lately, I had the oportunity to go to yours Circle Theatre event. Unfortunatly I never thought it could be so dissapointing. It started when I received the advertisement on the street. According to that, I thought I'd have a wonderful night. The first problem happened at the box office because there were abosolutly no discounts available. Well, I bought a the ticket anyway. The show supposed to start at 19:30 but it actually started forty five minutes after it. When the show began  had my biggest disappoint, instead of the great Danny Brook, there were another actor, totally unknown. After the show I was so nervous about the whole thing that I decided to eat at the restaurant and try to relax a little. From my surprise, it was closed. According to all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly one of the worsts. I'd like so, to reiceve my money back. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Techology is always getting better. And it is responsable for many changes in my life, and I think I wouldn't be able to live without it anymore. Nowaday, with  Internet it had became easier to do the school works and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favorite football team. I also got recently a celular phone and I don't now  I lived so long without one - because it help to solve the problems so quickly, it's really amazing. But for me, the best thing is definatly the microwaver. And there is a quite good reason for it. I live alone, so I have to cook my own food, and I'm the worst cooker in the whole world. There are some of the   modern techonologys that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me. ",28.0
37," Dear Mr Jane Clark I am writeing to you to ""help"" you with your festival next year, last year wasn't very good so maybe we can make it more atracite this year? the first  I think we shoul rent biger hall for that so we could make  better sound and give more space for  viewers! If we will make one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events we can make intrestede more people. We can inaute stars and artists from around the world who will make and prisentspresent all kind of music like jazz, rock, classical ect. It should be done show so people can see how people in every corner of the word make theyr own fun. Art exhibitions is  good idea too, to introdus how the music is making and show how the instruments lode. Afterward we could let people talk with  artists so they can get knoe theyr privacy. Mr. Jane if you want get more of my suggestions and opinions about it pleace contact with me on my calle phone  Sincirley  [SEP]  Dear Simona! Thank you for your letter it was so nice to hear from you gain and I am glad you have meant this subject. It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules then Polish schools but may be we might find sth incomon?!  What rules do we have in our schools? The first of all it dipends what kind of school it is? Primary, highschool or university! I think that now Polish schools are going foward but they still have lots of bad habits. Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have less pracite lessons,  sometimes it's hard to get a books or other neaded things  to study.  Conneat between students and their teachers or principals is very poor! During the lesson we are not allowed to have food or stg drink,  we can't be late to school School  supose to be our second home but it's not we work hard and for the end  our education we still have nothing. You asking me what would I change? I would make schools more unstressfull,  added fun cause it's easeyer  way to learn and I would gives students more chances to share yo with their fantazy at school. Maybe  Polish system is not bad, but it's conftyble too. I know that that letter will not change anything but you can see how compliated is  Polish studen's life Your   ",20.00
273," Dear manager, My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am writting to make you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical show of the London theatre. I decided to see the 19:30 show so I arrived on time at 19:00 o'clock. I went to buy the ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near of the stage I bought a £20 tiket but when I asked for the discount they told me ""I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement, It will be impossible to make you a discount"". This was my first problem. At 19:15 I was very impatient waiting for the show begins and a man anounced that the show will start at 20:15. I had to wait more that an hour outside the theatre because to make matters worse I couldn't spend the time in the theatre restaurant. The reason they gave me  it was closed because it was being repaired. Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor. Now what I hope is you refound me my money, it was a horrible evening out Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I would be the best party of the year. Last month was my grandmother birthday and I organised a party for her. My grandmother loves the parties and when she was young she used to organise big parties for all the family and friends. Now she is 85 years old so she can't do that but, I can. I organised everything like: the place, the food, the decoration, I sent letters by post to everybody she knows. It seems  to be the bigger party of her life. I thought she could have a show in this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend,  if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programes. She loved the idea and said she had differents shows so  to decide which could be the most suitable. I told her to make me a phone cold. Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought  but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended. But after all the party was great.

Our class really appreciate for preparing this programme, especially for Monday's atraction. We are extremaly interested in wisiting London. The idea of sightseeing by bus would be a great possibility for us to know better our wonderful capitol. Although we are excited about the scientic, I would like you to ask, if it would be possible to change our schedule a little bit. In  last edition of 'London's Guide' we saw an advert of 'The London Fasion and Leisure Show', which will be held on Tuesday and it lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentiones  'latest fasions', which we are incredible interested in. In addition it recommends also  'Leisure and Sports Wear'. Thing which attract us the most are: 'Make up' and 'Hairstyles'. We strongly recommend it, because students' admission is free. I'm convinced that you agree with us and we take part in this show. We would be terribly grateful, if you accept our offer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Nowedays famous people don't have an easy life. They are always attacted by naughty journalists, which have  aspiration to earn big money for writing an extremaly good report, or article. To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly. In addition we are fascinated in their marriage, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known. By chosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look like. On the other hand, their life has no privaty. In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxiously and lonely. They are always under high pressure in their every-day life, because they are afraid of being recognise. Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions and films-stars belong to the public. In conclusion, I belive that we have  right to be informed about their life, providing that journalists respect some important rules. ",25.00
574," Dear Ms. Ryan, It was  wonderful surprise when I received your letter. Thank you very much for this great opportunity. Now, I am writing this letter to reply  your questions. Firstly, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only in July, which is the only month I can take holiday from my work. Secondly, for accomodation, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try. Regarding to the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports. However, I enjoy singing. I used to join the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my favorite hobbies. I normally bring blushes, paints and paper instead of  camera when I travel. Finally, I would like to ask you wheather  anything I should bring to this travel such as specific clothes, extra money etc. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a privelage to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of ""the Rolling Stones""! I did various things for them. At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made.  Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turning the volume up and down following to the musician's instruction. My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get jelous. This was the best experience. I could give the members ""Shiatsu massage"" just before the concert to make them relax!! Can you imagine how much I appreciated that I am qualified in massage? Well, Kim, I have to go now. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",31.0
1034," Dear Mr Robertson Our class is looking forward to going to London next week. The programme which you've organised we find very interesting especially the river trip to Greenwich. Thank you very much for it. There is only one thing that we'd like to change, if you wouldn't mind. We've read an advertisement about  London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday, March 14 from 10 oo to 19 oo. The latest fashions will be shown there and many useful tips about make-up and hairstyles will be given. According over programme we have a free time on Wednesday, March 15. So we'd like to go to a disco and this fashion show would be a great opportunity for us to learn something about styling. As we are from the small town we don't have any possibility to learn about this. We suggest to visit the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus. We think we'll find one free hour befor the River trip. It would be a good solution. We hope you are agree with us. Your class  [SEP]  In every country there are the famous people who are in the middle of the public attention. They are always expected to be beautiful, intelligent, good-looking. This is very stressful. That's why it's very important for these people to have a private life without journalists where they can relax and where they don't need to be superstars. To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars or politicians have a right for it. Otherwise they can get soul problems,  fall in deep depressions. I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example all 24 hours in a day, and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is your friend, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with. On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen. I think we should have a little bit  respect for the famous people and let them some time for their private life. ",33.00
759," Dears Ms. Helen Ryan, I was really greatful when I recieved your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition. I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July. Because my school finishes   end of June and I will have a month break  after that I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for it. Could you possibly tell me, at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins. Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents. I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis. Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them. Maybe I will have time to do enough practise as much as I always wanted to do. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I would need to bring with me and will I need any extra money for this holiday. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I don't know where to start but I can say it was the greatest time I have ever had. As I mentioned  you before  Friend of mine, she is a stage assistant and she needed a help for that pop concert last month. I told her if she need help I would be happy to help her. Next day when I went there I have met lots of people   very famous and very friendly. It took us almost a month to prepare for this concert. You wouldn't believe how hard it was. the stage was covered with all sort of light and we made it look like a waterfall. The waterfall made by real rock so that was the worst bit because they were really heavy and we had to carry them, but  the end of  moth when the concert started, it was all over. I sung and dance all day. I have lots of memory which I could never forget. I wish you were there. I hope you shared my happiness with me. Lots of love, ",25.0
680," Geneva, 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you a lot for your kind letter. I was very surprised on the result of the competition. Now I am happy to give you all the information you need. I think it would be better for me to travel on July. I will started an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave . In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins, well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals. I saw, you offer a lot of activities, that'is fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like  and I can also do the best. I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well. The other activity I like very muche is swimming. I took part at a lot of competitions. Now I would like to ask you if wee need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes. I hope I have give to you all the information you needed and I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely B. Müller  [SEP]  Geneva, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim I am happy to tell you about the experience I made at the pop concert last month. I had to start very early in the morning, at 7.30. We first had to prapare the stands with food and drinks and buy something which had been forgotten. Then we had to put on the night lights and decorate the whole room. In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin. I was very excited! He is very beatiful! At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert. I logically accepted. The interview I liked particularly Before the concert started, we had to  verify all  music instruments. The microphones all had to be controlled. Fortunatly we had no problem. The concert was a success. I was very proude of me and the work I had done. After  concert I left with Ricky Martin. We went to a nice restaurant and enjoyed dinner together. I am sure my dear Kim, I will never forget that wonderful experience. Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit of your adventure or experience you had in last time. lot of kisses your friend BM ",31.0
517," Dear Mr I'm writing to complain about what it happened  me two days ago, during you musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". A friend of mine went to see it the last May. He told me to go because the actor's performance was good. So I decided buying a ticket, but no discounts were available. Then with my disappointing I noticed that there was  different actor instead of Danny Brook. Nobody informed me about it. And why did the show start at 20:15 instead of 19:30? After the show, my friends and me decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it close. In conclusion, I ask for my money back because it wasn't a perfect evening like your advice showed. I hope that you understand me. Awaiting your reply, Your faithfully  [SEP]  It's true that modern technology has changed our daily life. In the pass, for example, we used to write letters to comunicate, but now we surely send an e-mail, a fax or make a phone . Certainly it will be easier and faster than write, but it was nice when you were waiting for a letter. Nowadays, you have all things immediatly and soon, but will it  be  good ? I think no. Everyone have to use modern technology carefully, because too much technology could be dangerous. It couldn't allow us  to think and to do freely. Today there are children that don't know nothing about nature and its things. Probably, because their parents haven't enough time to go out the city and show them nature. So they prefer leave their sons wecting TV. Modern technology? Yes, but we mustn't loose the values and our free time to stay with our family. ",23.0
197," Dear Sir: I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, in the other case, I would have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I'm telling you this because I had a big trouble a few days ago because of her. Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I knew all the truth. I used to tell Pat everything about myself - my problems with my parents, my problems with the school, friends and more. I was always talking to her and she was always listening to me but she didn't talk to me very much about herself. At first, I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't care too much about that and I easily forgot it. In other words, Pat knew all my secrets. I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets. My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends. I asked them why they had asked me that. Their answer surprised me too much. They told me Pat used to be a close friend of them and she used to talk about me and my problems. So, they had already knew all my secrets for a long time!  I got very angry and immediately I went to talk to Pat. At first, Pat denied all the things my friends told me about herself but she finally agreed with that. I asked her why she couldn't keep my secrets and she told me that it was impossible for her keeping secrets. She was very sorry about that and  few days after she moved in to another city and actually I don't know anything about her. I thanked my new friends for not to tell anybody my secrets  though before the trouble they and me weren't very  friends. Now I'm very happy with my new friends and I have learnt that I can't trust anybody too much because you don't really know how the person is like. ",33.0
635," I am writing in reply to your letter, which I have received last week, and in fact I am very surprised and please for the prize. First of all I would like to travel in July because  is my  free month since I am student and I am very busy during all year. Secondly, according to accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a long cabin, due to I used to use the tent on holiday and I haven't got very good experiences. Thirdly I chose photography and swimming because I have previous experience in these activities and of course I have some diplomas which I will send you. In addition, I work every summer as a Monitor in the leisure centre in my town. Apart from this photography is one of my favorite hobbies and I usually spent nearly all my spare time practising it and of course I have some diplomas as well. Lastly I would like to ask you for some questions. On the one hand I would like to have further information about which kind of clothes I need for that area. I don't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both . On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes, since I need to know how much money I have to take. I look forward to receiving a prompt reply. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello it's been ages since we were in touch, I'm sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I have been very busy last month, with this job. I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed  a lot and of course I knew a lot of people there. I found this opportunity through the Radio in an advertisement. On the one hand at first I was a little insure about if I was able to do this job, because they needed people with some skills and experience. But later I decided to call them and ask them for further information about this job. After a interview I was chosen for it, I couldn't believe it. I feel that this was a good oportunity for me, not only for my professional but also for my personal life. Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of my speciality,  for me was the most important real experience. According to my job, I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience: at the end I felt  a member of them, because they were so kind to me, and I could colaborated a lot of and I learnt a lot with this project. Furthermore, I found it very short time and they offered me  new project for the summer. I hope to hear from you soon. ",26.0
1160," Dear Mrs Smith, Hello Maria. In this letter you will get all the information that you need. The hotel that group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel (In the Victoria road). And you can take the Bus in front of the hotel to go to the College. It is four bus stops . Then walk straight for five minutes, you will see the college. After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds. The rest you already knows. I suggest to wear shirts and jeans. And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the ""Imax"" cinema to watch a 3-D film! After we eat in the KFC. Then we all take you and the students to the airport. That's all. I wait you. Your sincerly  [SEP]  Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places. But the best place for me is ""La Vaguada"". An entertainment and commercial building. In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas, can watch a film and eat all kind of food and have shopping. We can have fun as well. And that's why I recommend this place to you. The building itself is a large building. It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras. The buildings seems to be very new but it is quite old. People love this place and called it ""Madrid-two"". Around it, there are many restaurants and shops as the building bring a lot of people. Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well. And it is easy to come. Just take the bus 83 or the sub-way. In here, you can find everything that you want. Hope you like it. ",26.00
830," Dear Helen Ryan, It would be a great plessure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm. First of all, as a reply for your letter, I'd like to say, that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full-time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time. In July I can make an exception. According to accomodation I would prefer log cabins, as they are more comfortable and I like convenience. As to the list of activities I choose climbing and surfing. I like new challenges, even when I've never done them before, and I'm really looking forward to gaining this new kind of experience. If you don't mind I would like to ask you some vital questions. Do I have to take warm clothes? How much money would you recommend me to take? I would appreciate  if you send me a reply for my Questions as soon as possible Yours faithfully Tadeusz Ochman  [SEP]  ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable"". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who with  smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous. So, as a conlusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead. ",34.0
268," Saturday, June, 17th Dear M. White, I went to the Circle theatre last week on monday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening, there. Firstly, I've read in the advertisement that the actors who were playing that night were D. Brook and T. Truelove. Now you can guess how disappointed I was when I saw that there were different (and worse) actors! Secondly, the musical show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.. so I had to wait forty-five minutes outside and it was raining cats and dogs! And then I discovered that the discounts were not available for the tickets. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show and I was really hungry because I hadn't had my dinner that evening in order to be on time for the show. To sum up, It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"". I'd rather say that it was a catastrophe! And I am really sorry, but consequently I would ask you for some money back. Thank you for considering my request. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology has completly changed my daily life, which became more comfortable, and easier. For instance, my discman gives me the possibility to listen to music or to the radio everywhere: in the underground, or when I walk in the city. Moreover, it disturbs nobody, and that's great. Another simple example is my mobile telephone; A few years ago, I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner, or other stuff like that. Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I bring it everywhere. But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the internet - Thanks to it, I have  hundred friends all over the world and I know many different cultures. All these examples are very few demonstrations to show how technology could affect our lives nowadays. In my point of view, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions. ",32.0
33," Dear Jane Clark With attendance to the annual international arts festival which you took place on 21 and 22th November 2000, I spend  tremendous two days enjoying some features. Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations. Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there were some variety of features in it. Next, One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also  fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything by the ticket. However, according to my notes, there are some doubt in the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact. The number of plays and films were also very few. In addition to that some concert halls were too small  to enjoy the concerts. On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars  more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken place. I would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Albert Thanks for your letter, it was great to hear from you. I know you're fine, but I've been very busy studying because I have to take  exam next month. So this is  quick note to tell you what you want to know, as you asked about school rules and house ones. At school, the most horrible one is  school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes, colourful shoes and colourful socks. We can't also turn our hair colour an have to keep  hair length above  eye blows. Next, we're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we've students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them. However, at home I'm quite free. Just I can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I'm not allowed to play computer games  over two hours. These  are not so strict that I can stand them. I don't think I want to change them. Anyway, that's all about my  information which you want. Write soon, I look forward to hearing from you. Love ",33.00
177," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complain about your theatre and the musical show ,,Over the rainbow"". Firstly, in your advertisement  was said that Danny Brook has a part in the show, but there was a different actor in the play. This fact disappointed me a lot. Secondly, there was written in the advertisement, that the show begins at 19.30, however, it started at 20.15. According to the advertisement, discounts should be available, but, in fact, I was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way. It was very uncamfortable for me. In addition to this, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late (the show did not start on time). Everybody, who came to it's doors, had to go to the other restaurant in  bad mood. I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting. Furthermore, I would like you to return my money. You promised me  perfect evening out, but it was one of the most terrible in my life. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was  25-years-old secretary in one big company. Her boss was  rich man, really rich. His name was Timson White. He was one of the most famous person in his city, but he wasn't honest with his clients. Pat had worked for him for two years. Certainly she knew a lot of secrets. One of them was about her boss' private life: he had got  illegal son. Timson's wife, who was good looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He even couldn't say a word. He tried to make up who could give his wife knows. Of course, only one person had known this except his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check it up. Next day he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed  new secretary. It was the worst weekends in a last few years. On the other hand, now everything is o.k. Timson has a good close family, his son lives with them, his company makes a good profit... Only Pat has problems, she should earn her living in other company again! ",26.0
350," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement which inform me wrong information. While I had a holiday in London I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"", but I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, I am a fan of Danny Brook so your advert attracted me but when I went there a different actor was in the musical show instead of him. I was so disappointed. Secondly, your timetable was wrong. It said the show started at 14.30 but, actually, it started at 20.15 so we had to wait for about six hours. Thirdly, I saw ""Discount Available"" on your advert but your staffs said it was just for Mondays. Your advert made me misunderstood. Finally, we visited your theatre restaurant after the show. However, it  closed because it was being decorated. Your advert promised me  ""Perfect evening out"", but it was  terrible evening to me. So I want you to give me a refund. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully, Ko Hyu Tung  [SEP]  How has mordern technology changed my daily life? When I was young, I used to play sports such as football, basketball and tennis with my friends but, these days, I am getting used to sitting in front of the computer and watching TV. When I bought my computer, I wasn't interested in it but when I started studying about  internet and playing games, I found it interesting. Sometimes, I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home, my hand go to  computer swich, automaticaly, even though I don't want to use the computer. I usually spend my time on playing computer  about three hours a day. After that, I go to the sofa for watch TV. Although there aren't programmes which are interesting, I just watch TV, so my mother calls me ""Couch Potato"". As a result, my health is getting worse. I know I need to excercise but it is difficult for me to start. Modern technology has changed my daily life from physical activity to mental activity (??) ",27.0
1148," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. As you asked me in the letter, I am very happy to help you with finding out  details of the conference. The hotel that your group will be staying at is  Palace Hotel. It is reasonably near to the college, so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along  River Thames following  yellow signs on sunny days. If it rains, you can take  bus 54 that stops in front of the college. The end-of-conference party is designed to give  rough ideas about many different cultures. So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world. As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country. Other members of  groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress. On the last day, I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city. It is about 1000 years old, so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you imagine your life without any computers at all? Well, I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert! If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear  that  invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives. For example, all infrastructures such as  transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals. In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers. So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important. From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool. It improves  productivity of my homework, that is often essay writing, and also it allows me to access to the internet. Since I live abroad, the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and  to know what is going on in my home country. To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both indivisuals and a society as a whole. ",38.00
906," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you for the amazing inform about the competition. I am really glad to be able to win the first prize and travel to the U.S.A. which I used to dream . Now, I would like to reply  some questions you need, willingly. At first, I would like to travel only in July because I study at University at the moment. However, they will give me such a long holiday enough to travel for two weeks in June. I would prefer staying  tents to log cabins, as I'd like to observe nature and stay in outdoor as much time as I can. I'm very happy with the activities you organised. I am good at playing basketball, swimming, tennis, surfing as they are my hobbies for donkey's years. I would rather play golf and go sailing, than the others so as to find new hobbies in my life. Finally, what I would like to ask is what sort of cloths are suitable for the travelling, and also, how much money I should prepare for the travelling, approximately. I would be grateful if you could reply  my letter with some further information soon. Yours sincerely Takashi Oshima.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you going these days? I'm fine as usual. Anyway, I joined the team which helps anything at a pop concert last month as you know. In my view, it was extremely interesting and satisfing for me all the concert long. Talking of my work, I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows. If you choose the post, you would be exhausted throughlly in the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby. Although I can not explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter, I'd like to recomend you to help at a pop concert or the other. It must be a good experience and a special memory for you. See you and write  me soon. Best Wishes ",23.0

I'd prefer to sleep in tents rather than log cabins: sleeping in tents seems to correspond to a ""spirit of adventure"" to me, what I particularly like; in the opposite, log cabins are more ""traditional"" and a less interesting experience. I'm very interested in basketball and sailing, which are both team activities. As I was a child, I was very good at basketball, even one of the best of my class. I like playing in  team and deciding quickly what to do next. These reasons are why I'd also like  sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospherical conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need. I think you very much in advance for your kind assistance. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make a pleasure to the buyer and for that reason, will be enjoyable. But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try . When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing. Hopeful, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest! ",32.0
747," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter that I have just received. I am very happy to win first prize in your competition. - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am also very excited about it. If it is possible I would like to travel in July. This is the only month that I will be free. Because I am studying the Management and Finance at university and it will finish at the end of June. I will be in italy in August. Because I need to improve my italian and I am taking a very important exam next year. I would be appreciate it if I could stay in  tents at  Camp. Because I usually go on camping-site holiday, with my friends. It is great fun. I really like staying in tents. It is also written in your letter that we will have to  chance to do two activities. I am really good at playing tennis and singing. I have been playing tennis for five years and I love it. I play the classicial guitar and I also sing songs. I have been playing the classicial guitar for three years. It is quite difficult but I like difficult things. I wonder if you could tell me about the wheather and what kind of clothes I have to bring with me. I would also like to know how much money I need. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely,  [SEP]   RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING Why do people like shopping? First answer is that they need  shopping. Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel  going shopping. When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but  if it is possible to do  shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for. I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent for three hours and we couldn't buy anything. It was incredibly crowded. We couldn't even move and the most people were just looking and were wasting of their time. If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really  good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time. Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad  situation you are in because when I was a child I always had an argument with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very ashameful for my mum. She was also very angry. Because she never managed to get me out from the toy shop. As you see shopping is not always enjoyable. Always make sure that  is  right time to go shopping. ",34.0
483," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show I saw at the Circle Theatre on Wednesday, June, 14th which was titled ""Over the Rainbow"". First of all, the advertisement I got layed emphasis on Danny Brook's starring , but eventually, a disappoint unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills to. To make matters worse, not only was the restaurant closed, without any appearant reason, but also the discounts that were said to be available were not. On top of everything, the performance began forty-five minutes late. I find it unbearable to witness such a lying advertising and to pay even ten pounds to spend such a disappointing evening. Consequently, I ask for  money back, and I will not obviously go back in the Circle Theatre. I join my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she had caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential, Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested in it, and decided to lead her own enquiry about this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story looked very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat reached her purpose by questioning carefully her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to rob this camera unless he wanted to be hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the adults' help. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She  convicted the two criminals, and had the calm gone back within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone  telling a secret, and she realized she had made the good choice. ",26.0
859," Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your nice letter which informed me   to have won first prize in my competition. I'am really surprising and happy about it. In your letter you needed  some informations about me. Unfortunately, I have only the possibility to travel in July because in August I will start a new job for six months. I won't be free, however all July I am at home. For accommodations at this camp, I would prefer being in a tent to being in a log cabin. It is more amusing and friendly. It will allow me to make friends more quickly. Two of my best activities are swimming and photography. The first one  is a needless for me. I go every day swimming  one Mile. The last summer I won a prize in competition of swimming. The second one is more  a hobby. I like go in nature and make photography. I started it two months ago. I don't have any material. Could you tell me if you would lend me some material for photography? What sort of clothes will I need for these two weeks? How much money will I take with me? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Henri Devereux  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm so happy with the experience I lived last month. I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month. I was really great. Firstly I was designed to sell the tickets. I was already happy to help in such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer's concert. I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge. They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe. It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer. Are you thinking? I was so exciting! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager John and her musicians.  All were very kindly and pleasant. It was a big moment for me. Finally these people are like us, they have just a special job with special times. The next year, if it will be possible, I would like go back with you. They will organise a same concert pop but with an other singer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love, Henri ",23.0
224," To the manager of the Circle Theatre. I am PINAR xxx. One week ago I watched your show. I was so disappointed because I didn't find what I expect at your show. The first thing that dissapoint me was the starring. I expected to see Danny Brook because at the paper that you have given to me it wrote that Danny Brook came but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts  available but they are not available. You wrote that ""visit our restaurant after the show"" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant. but the reastaurant was closed because the show started  20:15 and finissed at 00.15 and the restaurant was opened until 00.00. Finally you wrote that  ""your perfect evening out"" but after all this problems how would you expect the to have a perfect evening out. After all this problems I became dissappointed. Because that was only a week holiday in London. If you would give me some of my money back that would be a great excuse for the loss of time and my dissopointness.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. I know that before but I thought that he may change. I trusted him and told  about the reality. It was about Marine, who was our clase friends. The reality was  Marine's parents are not her real parents, they found her in their houses garden. They try so many things to find her family for one year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find . In this one year they spend most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they want to be her parents. When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and sad that he is Marine's father and  wont to take her. and he added that he leave Marine because her mother was dead two days after Marine's birth. and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him on prison he had nobody that he can give marry  so he leave her on their garden. The Marine's real father want her back but the other cuples didn't want to give her  because they loved Marine so much. They give a lot of money to Marine's real father to take her. After that Marine's father take the money & left her. The cuples couldn't say the reality to Marine because they were afraid of losing her. After I told the reality the Pat. Pat said this the Marine. Marine said to Pat that ""I had knowed that because I talked with my real father every month but my parents doesn't know that because I am waiting for them to say me the reality"". ",25.0
188," 17th December 2000 Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about my awful evening at the Circle Theatre. I am very disappointed. Last week I went to see a musical show called 'OVER THE RAINBOW' at the Circle Theatre. I was first, very excited to see the show, because on the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I can have a perfect evening at there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening. I went to see my favourite actor Danny Brook acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started late then I expected. It should be from 7,30 p.m, but it was from 8.15 p.m.! I want to complain about the ticket. On the advertisement it said that discounts are availble, but when I asked a staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went  the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed early than usual. I think they should keep the times correctly. I am very disappointed with everything what happened last week. I would like a refund. I excpect this will be possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future by XXX 17/6/00 My article is about fashion in.  future Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes. Like wearing T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc. They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes. Like earings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hairbands, hand bags, shoes, watches, etc. They like designers clothes and everyone wear different modern clothes in size, in colour and in shapes. The fashion gradually changed from the old days and it is still changing to the future. Maybe in 100 years from now, fashion will be totally different. Everyone may think that in  future people will wear silver clothes like in space movies. I think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in  future. Every one will wear very colourful balloons on them. With balloon clothes they will be able to fly up in the sky. Everyone will not walk on roads. They will bounced on roads with there balloon clothes. In  future they will wear balloon clothes, because to make people fly. They will use a special gas inside  balloons to make them fly. For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will be not dangerous. If we use up carbon dioxide with  balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about Ozone breaking. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in  future. It is to save our Earth. Would you like to wear balloon clothes and bounce around the world? If yes, wait until  2100s! ",28.0
1040," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the trip to London on the 13th, 14th and 15th March. Firstly, I would like to thank you very much for the good programme you have organised for my class. We are especially looking forward to join the river trip to Greenwich and  the sightseeing by bus. Secondly, I have seen an advertisement in the times about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be attended in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14. My class and I are all interested in it and we would like to go there to have a visit. It will be  great opportunity for all of us because they will show the latest fashion, the leisure and sports wear, the make up and the different hairstyles. Furthermore, the admission for students is free. I have alredy thought about a changing of the programme. On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time  doing shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we moved have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will take my proposal in favoreable consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. What was so dangerous and why I had to do it? Now I will tell you in brief what exactly happened to me. It was a fantastic sunny day of August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided to go to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lied on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing of me. So I took the decision to go and join them also if I knew that it would have been dangerous for my life. I walked very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends could understand that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided taking up swimming, so that I would have had no embarrass in the future trips to the seaside any more. ",35.00
114," Dear Sir/Madam, During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" but, unfortunately I was very disappointed. At first, as I have read in your advertisement, Danny Brook should have stared in this show. A different actor has appeared, but I must say that he was very disappointing. Secondly, you have written that the musical starts at 19:30. I had to wait for the show for over fourty five minutes, because it started at about 20:15! What is more, it has been written that I can get some discounts, but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket, it was impossible. You have also placed a note about your theatre restaurant opened after the show. I wanted to drink a coffee but, unfortunately it was closed, because the waiter went out! To sum up, I must say that this evening out was supposed to be perfect. It was not of course, so I would like to ask you kindly for my money back, because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my daily life very much. At first, there are now a lot of things that most people use at home. For example: a fridge, a cooker or just an electricity. We couldn't imagine our life without them. Secondly, thanked to the technology, there are many ways of travelling today. We produce cars, trains and plains which are better and better. What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipement. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe it will be a remedium against AIDs or cancer soon. On the other hand, the modern technology has some disadvantages. The main  is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world. The second is the nuclear weapon and  many wars, in which modern equipement is used. To sum up, as far as I am concidered, modern technology has changed my life completely. On the one hand it helps me a lot in daily life, but on the other I'm afraid of the future everyday. ",26.0
872," Dear Sir or Madam, Thank you for your letter. I'm very happy that I have won. You ask me when I would like to travel? I can travel only in July because I have  holidays from my work only in this month. So it would be very nice, if it's possible. By the Accomodation at the Camp, I would prefer the tents, because it is something different wich you don't make everyday! Then the activities that I would like to do are Singing and Swimming. Singing because it's my favourite hobby and I grew up with it and Swimming because I like water and the feeling that you have when you are in it. Another reason for  swimming is that I'm good at it because a few years ago I had lessons, where I learn very good swimming. Finaly I've got a question: What clothes must I bring with me and how much money? I'm looking forward  hearing from you. yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Everybody likes shopping! To look for clothes and shoes is for every women one of their favourite hobby and if it were possible they would stay the whole day in the shopping-centre. But shopping isn't always enjoyable. Sometimes it isn't so easy to find what you need. For example: you have in your memory a great pair of shoes that you have seen last week in a shop. Now you will by it but it's nowhere to find! That's a pity! Sometimes it's very awful when you have to wait  very long  until it's your turn to pay or to try some clothes on. Another thing that makes you fourious, is when you see a great shirt in  shop and somebody else take it away or buy it before you can react. That things had happend to everybody, hadn't they? So you see that shopping isn't always enjoyable. ",24.0
1027," 12th December 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to thank you for organising a nice programme for us. Especially, going to the Museum and the Art Gallery would be a great oppotunity for all of us, as they are world-famous places in London. However, there is something I need to ask you. Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. In the show, we will be able to see the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. The entrance fee is free for students so the show is well worth seeing. To go to the show, we need to alter the programme. The show is on 14th and takes a whole day. So, if we could go to the Museum by using the free time on 15th it would be okay although we could not go shopping. I look forward to hearing from you shortly. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Story It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school. I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself. It was a horrible day, the day I had left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, noway to contact with my parents. What I decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, beause I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippy! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully,  not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house. It was a scary, but thrilling and exciting incident!

930," Helen Ryan Competitor Organiser Dear Helen, I am writing to you in replay to the letter I have recently recived, to inform you about some details that I am concerned about. First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and, afterwards, I will start my university studies in September which means  lots of things to be sorted out. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easyer for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants. In your letter you settled the possibility  to choose two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join to basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them due to I've played  in my secondary scholl as leader of my team and due to my long training periods in lifting weights. Lastly, do I need to take with me any special staff of clothes? Do I need some money? and if it is so, how much? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory. There is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like. All this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half  price in another shop.

531," To the manger of the Circle Theatre Mr Smith Caen, Saturday June 17th Mr Smith, I have recently been to London on a holiday trip so I decided to spend my free-time going to the musical show you were advertising for. It seemed very attractive and the different informations on the ad pushed me into going to it. Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars Mr Smith and I think that you've lied to such naive tourist like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the part and we only had different and pityful ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed of forty-five minutes. It is a shame! I ought not to talk about the restaurant  closed for no apparent reasons You had promised a perfect evening but I spend an horrible one  and you ruined my holiday! What are you mistaken us for, Mr Smith? Foolish idiots? We did not deserve such  bad show. That's why I want my money back! Now! Otherweise I'll have to put some others ads  in London saying that your show is just a fake!  [SEP]  How modern technology changed your daily life! To begin with, I'd like to underline how the place of technology has increased since a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the  economic prosperity many goods like TV, washing-machine, etc. became cheaper and available. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite  seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life? As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influence me is in my work: the internet has become such an incredible tool, I can make research about everything I want, find informations for lectures for example or exercices. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge. Nevertheless, new technology has made me become more lazy. I spend a lot of  free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing  the computer. Maybe it  change me into a kind of self-centered person, a loner. But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in  way  to communicate. It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent. I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone. But we should not forget that it's only tools and  emphazise human relationships. ",23.0
175," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theatre. Unfortunately your advertisement about it wasn't true! Firstly, it's written that  it will be played by Danny Brook, but in fact it wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard about it. In addition to this, the timetable 19.30 wasn't correct. We've lost our time waiting outside in the cold  that the doors would get opened 45 minutes later. Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a reduce. Again, it wasn't true. When I enquired about the discounts, at the cashier they told me that they didn't have any information about it. At least, after all my disappointments when I wanted to visit your restaurant, it was closed because it was too late. I think that you are not a good manager. Therefore, I should be grateful if you would send me back some money for all the disagreements I've had in your theatre. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is my best friend. We spent all our childhood together usually driving our parents mad. As we grown up, we were getting closer and closer sharing all our love stories and even more. I'm certain, that our friendship is stronger than other people. But I do have a problem with her. Pat isn't good at keeping secrets. Even worth, she is not able to keep anything . For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday asking all . friends  to close their mouths. All did except one: Pat. Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately driving too fast I drove through the front gate. I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them. Of course, the following day all my family had heard about my odd story. In conclusion to this, why do I still go on with her, it's the fact I love her as well as my sister and I know that she can change it if she would because last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.

195," Dear Sir/Madam I want to complain about your advertisment about the theatre 'Over the Rainbow' I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show, but he wasn't. Secondly the show didn't start until 20:15 but it should have started  19:30 so we had to sit and wait which was very boring. There were no discounts on the ticket available either. After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed because rebuilding. In the advertisement it says ""your perfect evening out"" but it was a real disappointment. I would like to have the money back that I spent on the tickets I bought. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours Faithfully Svetlana  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She had always been like that, said my best friend Ann to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret yesterday. The secret was that I was in love with Peter in my course. I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone. Yesterday when I arrived to the college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strange at me and laufhing. I felt how I started to blush. In the classroom it became even worser. People started to whrite things on the board and pointing at me. In the lunchbreak I went to Pat and asked her why she had told him the secret, but she just ignored me like she didn't know me. After that I never went back to the course again. ",35.0
110," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about the show, that I have recently attended to at your theatre. During my visit there occurred some problems, that made my evening completely disappointing. Firstly, as I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. Not only the play started 45 minutes after it was planned, but as the actors eventually appeared at the stage, have I also seen, that Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information  given about the reason of it's closure. As you see, my evening in your theatre absolutely wasn't perfect. I hope I will get a full refund. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Have you ever thought of a year 2100? Do you think, that  world will be different from  current world then? I would answer ""yes"" for both questions. And if I were asked, what will be completely different in  year 2100, I would say: clothes. Most of the scientists, when asked about the Earth in a hundred years claim, that it is going to be absolutely scorching here then. In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more,  ground will be so hot, that going will only be possible in huge shoes, which should be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be, that people won't be allowed to get out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials, that aren't known yet. On the whole, we can only predict what clothes will be like in  year 2100. But in case my predictions are right, maybe you should buy a new pair of shorts? ",31.0
863," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter with congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need. First of all, I would like to start with the time of the travelling. I would prefer to go to the Camp on July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August. As regards accomodation, I would rather choose staying in tents. That is because I am keen on hich-hicking and I amused to living in tents. It is quite romantic, I think. As to the activities offered I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not quite good at the last one. Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure. As regards swimming, it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now. In the conclusion I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information. I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me. I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzeled about what to wear there. Besides, I would like to know how much money will I need and which expensies will I have to pay for by myself. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely XAVA SURGANOVA  [SEP]  Subject: to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about  daily life of our school. Introduction. The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see  watching the short videofilm about the daily routine of our school. The Area Around the School: I have made a little survey on the subject of my report and I have elucidaded that most of the pupils of our school consider that the region and the area around school should be filmed first. Personally I agree with their statement and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school. We should film our gardens around  school and a pitch with the playgrounds for volley-ball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning. Classrooms, Lessons and Breaks. Next things to be shot, by the majority of students was said to be the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the decoration of our classrooms and  atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been made during the last  years and all  modern conveniences that were made for both students and teachers. And as regards breaks student consider them being a very important part of school life, despite all their mess and noise. Outdoor Activities And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities, which our student are provided with in our school. We can make some short shots about the school theatre and it's performances and also about the sport-clubs and their competitions and awards. Conclusion In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey made among the students of our school. I hope you will consider this information.

205," Sir, I have seen your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" in London. I have been very disappointed when I had read your advertisement, I was keen on your show, but I have not seen the same show, I have seen one which it looked like, but not be . First of all I have been attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who played effectly that evening. This actors appeared with fourty-five minutes later refering which is written on your advertisement. This late forbid me   to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing! For all this reasons I do wish that I would not have been gone see that show, for which the tickets were not available. And as a conclusion I want you to give me my money back, (I have still the advertisement if you want the prooth  what I say). You have the choice, either you make what I want, or I attack you in justice. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  ""The old man and the sea"" E.H. When I have read this book, I have been fascinated by the will of the old fisher. This will is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance  to meet someone who could help him. But I don't think he would want to. He doen't want  because he wants to prove  the little  and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big age. I think this are the reasons of his will. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumph othe  fish because of his knowledge of the sea but  principally because he has known research in the deeper of his mind. To conclude I think the difficults situations allow us to discover ourself getting out of ourself. ",23.0
336," Dear sir, I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that was place last evening. None of  conditions was fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed by another actor. As a result it was a disappointing performance. Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisment said that it was going to begin at 19:30. On the other hand, it there wasn't any discounts in the sell of the tickets. To make matters worse, when the show finished we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because of the fact that it was closed (since it was being painted). I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all  promises that appeared in the advertisment. Of course, what it was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and I would  very greatful if you  refund me a compensation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? I imagine it will be very different. Sciencist will invented new materials that will keep the  temperature in a suitable range. In that way people won't feel cold or hot, they will be always at the same temperature. In addition these new material won't weight hardly anything. As well, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowaday, however it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport or everything you have to do. For that reason clothes will be simplier and more practise. Besides, everybody will be able to afford to buy  then that's why the prize of this sort of material will be very available. Of course, the resources used and  manufacturing  will be completely harmless for the enviroment because people will be more aware of the neccesity of taking care of the world we live in. ",31.0
508," Dear Sir I write a letter to complain about your advertisement about the musical show ""over the rainbow"", wich is misleading in a number of way. Firstly we arrived at 19.15 to be in time for the show, which should have started at 19.30. However it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed. Furthermore, it's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reason to why we went. Imagine how disappointed we got when we found out that he had been replaced. Besides, when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discounting was available. Unfortunately, it wasn't and we couldn't afford bying everyone a ticket. Finally, after the show we had planed to eat diner at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to  closed. Therefor, as you may understand I'm asking for a refund. These kinds of misadventures can easily ruin your reputation. I look forward to hearing from you Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and the rumours describing me stealing soon reached the director's office. I was send a letter in which it was written that the director wanted to meet me and my parents. Sweating and affraid I waited out side the director's office the following day. I was unable to image what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen. 'You may enter' said the director. Tairs ran down my face as I admitted having stolen. I was suprised that my father didn't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me. Mother, on the other hand, looked at me and seemed both disappointed and betrayed. During the trip home non of us spoke. We just sat calmly waiting for this nightmare to be over. The same evening my father pronounced a few words: 'May this be the end of your thief career we are only ready to forgive if you promiss never to start again'  ",28.0
478," Dear Manager, I'm writing you this letter because yesterday I went to the theatre to see the musical show and I had many problems, so I demand my money back. First of all when I paid my entrance  they didn't acept me my discount ticket, they said me that the ticket was false, then I enter to the theatre and I had to wait 45 min, the show was suposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, ""this is a lack of respect"". When the show started the starring was wrong because it said that act Danny Brook and Tina Truelove  and Danny Brook did'n act, it was another actor that nobody knew, ""Really this is very disappointing"". After the show I planned to go to the restaurant with my wife, but what do you think it happened? ""The restaurant was closed"". Manager I spect that you considered my bad experience in your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because, it was a very bad evening. Sincerely,  [SEP]  Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate. The class had organized a secret party for our friend, Nick that was leaving the school on 2 more weeks. All started when Pat, the best friend of Nick, wanted to make the party in his house, most of the class disagree with that because the house of Pat is extremly little, they started to say  him that his house was like a box. Pat got very angree and sad. Pat affected with this situation told Nick all  the situation and the secret of the class. At the beginning Nick got angree but then he forgive him because they were friend and each of one can trust on the other. Nick told the situation to the class and ofered his house to do the party, because  was very big, with large gardens and a big swimingpool. The day of the party all had fun especially Pat that at the beggining was sad. ",23.0
48," Dear Ms Clark, I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate  on the organization. I am also writting to make a suggestion and to give  my opinion for next's year festival. An internation arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were starts and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the possibility to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures. In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert, ""La Moldava"" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough, it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies. I am glad to tell you that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because also people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival. I would like to give a suggestion. I think that meeting writers, dancers, musicians and artists could be very interesting for anybody. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you very much for your recent letter. I'm very happy that you are well. When I read your letter I was surprised because I didn't know that you have so many rules both at school and at home. In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht. Nobody has to be late in the morning because it is important to respect  class mades and teachers' effort of getting up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour. There isn't a kind of punishment for people who do these things. My parents are very good. The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lays. It's important for them that I tell them where I'm going if I go out and what time I think of coming back home. I can do what I like doing but I have to study. This is the only condition  to do what I prefer. There isn't anything that I'd like to change. Write soon Love ",28.00
280," Dear Mr. Smith; I am writing this letter to make you know  the bad points of the theatre. First, it didn't start at 19.30. It started at 20.15. We had to wait for 45 minutes. I got bored. Not only me but also the others got bored. It was wrote in the newspaper that Danny Brock took place in the play. But it was not Danny Brock, it was a different actor. If there had been a problem, it would have been told us. I wanted to see him but I couldn't see . This was very disappointing for me. When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount. But in the newspaper it was wrote to be a discount. I paid £20 to the cashier. I was hungry and I thought I could eat something at the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed without any reason. It was very rude. For this, I want my money back. Because I didn't enjoy  at the theatre. I hope you would not continue like this. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES Technology is the thing that makes our life easy. Technology is in every part of our life. We use cars, trains, ships or planes when we want to go somewhere. But if they weren't made, we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey. With the help of technology, we do our works in less time. For example; in the past people used horses to go  another place. And their life passed in the ways. But now we use planes to go  far  places. It takes less time than going by horse. And computers,  the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day by playing  computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their works. They connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes into the computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them. But it has also bad points. For example; wars. Using technology scientists make lots of powerful guns. It is bad for the world's piece. I think we should use the technology for the piece and use it for our fortune. ",24.0
779," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to enquire about the competition that I won and give some details to you about myself and my interests. In the first place, I prefer to travel on July because my school will not be closed before this date. Secondly, a tent holiday is always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members in  swimming-school team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is a good fun. Because of these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which  were given. I would like to know what types of clothes I need and beside this, how much money I need during my vacation. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's ages since I've heard from you. I hope you and your family are well. Last month, I had a great time at the concert of ""Dragon"" which is the most popular hard-rock group all over the world. They had a concert in my hometown that's why the organizators were looking for young people who can speak English. I applied and They took me on. I took part in the security department. The staff in that departnent are really friendly and helpful and they are also huge like giants. Basicly, I helped them connecting with the local police and getting some electronical equipments that they needed. They treated me as if I was the private secretary of the department, because of this sometimes I felt that the power was in my hands. By the way, I have already been invited  their next concernt. They gave me two free tickets. Would you like to come with me? Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",29.0
468," Dear Madam/Sir, I am writing to say I am not satisfied with your musical show. Recently I am interested in musical shows, because I have never seen it in my country. When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive for me. So I went to London to see the show. As I arrived there after 5 P.M., I missed the first performance, so I decided to see the 19:30 p.m performance. However it started  20:15! Furthermore there were no student discounts! The worst one was that the actor and actress were not the person who had been written  in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed. So, I could not concentrate on the show. After the show, when I went to the restaurant it was closed, because it usually opens between afternoon and evening shows. It was a really disappointing evening! So I am asking for some money back. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully Chu Jin-Sun.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? It could be difficult to feel how many things has been changed in our daily life. But if you thought   10 years before you can easily notice. I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view, In an advantage. The modern technology is developing toward convenience for human. So, we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using  internet. How incredable it is! However  not only this advantage but also there are lots of disadvantages. Although  mobile phone is very useful  our life, it might be harmful for our brain because of micro wave it can cause the cancer or traffic accidents. In addition the side effect of artificial farm products also can't be ignored in our daily life. So I would like to say  the science and techology changed our daily life  more convenience  it also could be dangerous. ",26.0
1228,"  Mrs Maria Smith, I'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference. The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc. To get from the hotel to the conference, you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne, and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet, Divonne. When you come out, just go on your right, and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school. The end-of-conference party will take place at the same place. Some musicians will play classical music, and there will be many different drinks and food. you should wear some formal clothes, but not necessary really pretty clothes For three hours, you could visit the museum of the Red Cross, which is very interesting. I hope that these informations will help you Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  The portable phone, a very useful invention! During all mankind history, there were discovers who tried to make human life better, but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made. When the phone without  cable was invented, one wasn't sure if it would be a success or not. But the research went on, and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful. The portable phone is an important invention, because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem. Moreover, some portable phones have a connection to the web, so it is easy to read  newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it. Personally, the portable phone has affected my own life, because when somebody is phoning  at home, I don't have to rush to take the phone, being afraid that it's too late. I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still don't have a portable phone. ",31.00
340," Dear Mr Redford, I'm writing to you to complain about the problems which were shown at the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show. In the advertisement I read that Danny Brook started in the show but when I got there I realised there was a different actor in his place whose acting wasn't good enough. I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't. It started at 20:15 leaving us writing for fourty five minutes. You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it. In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening in the show very unpleasant. As you are the manager of the show, you should try to avoid this sort of problems in future shows. I also ask  to return me some of my money for the unpleasant evening I passed at your show.  [SEP]  In the future people will wear clothes made of polyseer and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive. Clothes will be bright coloured and loose. I don't think anyone will wear a suit as it will be old-fashioned. Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong sunrays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will make damage to the human skin. Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm in cold winters' days. As you can realise I think  future's clothes will be adjusted not on only in fashion and the seasons but in the needs of every on as to protect from the earths pollution as well. ",34.0
406," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir! I am writing this letter to you, because the show ""Over The Rainbow"" which is the London's newest and best musical show, was not... for me. Pleas apologise me, but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made, which disappointed me very . I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor  play in that show. And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage. Please, if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake. I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 not on 19.30. Other thing was that there was no discounts available, and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sikness. I would be very grateful if I could get my money back. That evening which should be my perfect evening out, was in fact very tireing and boring. Apologise me for disturb. I am looking forward for  answer! Best regardes!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, I knew that he's  very talkative person, but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday party for tenes.

I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign ""Do not tell Agatha about that, this is a suprise party for her, please keep the secret!"" Pat arranged  great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breath taking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in  disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exaiting!!! We put off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard ""What the hell is going on?!!"" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR!

The advertisement shew two actors but I was surprised to see as the main caracter a different person. As well as this, to my horror, the performance didn't start at 19.30 but forthy five minutes later. In addition to this, the theatre restaurant was closed for lack of servants.

The computer is everywhere and it's available for everyone. An usefull help: The personal computer can fastly help you in lots of situations. Moreover, a variety of micro computers are now everywhere such as in your car, on your radio and so on. Have a good feeling with it!: On one side, the modern technology is extremely important, on the other hand you shouldn't abuse of it. Conclusion: I do think, however, the modern technology is essential for human being nowadays. Although the world of computers will develop day by day, I lively hope we (human being) could mantain our personality of seeing things. ",22.0
773," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you about the first prize I won in your competition. I am very pleased and I include the information you asked for. I prefer travelling in July because I am taking some important exams in September and I have planned to study in August. With reference to the accomodation I would rather stay in  tent because I think it is the best way to socialize. For what concernes the activities I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me. I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses. On the other hand I have never had a course of climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby. I would like to ask you something about the weather and clothes I should bring  not to have to buy anything there. In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not in the accomodation so that I could decide how much I must have with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Mafalda D'Accatino  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I bet you want to know everything about my great experience at Luna Pop's concert last month. Before that I had never thought I would play with a famous group. But maybe you want to hear the story from the beginning. As you know Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.  In that moment Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun  but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune. I think you can't believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience. This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed staying on the stage with all those eyes on me. I wish you had been with me but I'm sure you understand what I felt. Love Mafalda ",35.0

I was thinking 'what should I do?' I haven't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home. At that time he was unconcious, I kept asking myself 'should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him. I was struggling because I knew if I didn't help him, he would die in a short time. I decided to do something to this man, my first move was to check  was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe. And  checking his body condition. After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars. I ran back home for help. I phoned to  police And told  the whole story.

510," Dear Mr or Madam, I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play ""over the rainbow"" which is performing at  Circle Theatre. First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage, during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour  fifteen  past after. We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from the promise written in the advertisement. Defineteley, I want my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told  everything about Lynne Harter, our new collegue at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, it was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely agressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth, I continued: ""You can't believe it Pat, she wears trousers like  men and green flowery blouses"" Of course, my friend and I were laughing during half an hour. Two days after, when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told  everything about Ann1. In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well,  unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets. ",29.0

The Hotel that is booked for the students it is one of the beast in the area, it has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be. The best way to get there from The hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day you arrive, at 8:30 am. About the party which is just at the end of the conference, a good it would be a dance party and the students don't really need to wear special clothes, it's just to have a little dance and meet all the students, after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice  to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back.

959," 13th June Dear Ms Ryan I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to receiving your letter in which  said that I have won the first prize in your competition, for two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A. I am writing to inform  that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place in the university and it will start in August. Is there the time I request available? I would also like to ask  accommodation you offer are in tens or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer tens. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning. In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities. I can wait to do my painting for the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers . Finally, can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with , and how much spending money will be need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely JUAN LILY LEE  [SEP]  13th June Shopping is not always enjoyable. I don't really like shopping. Sometime when I'm boring and can't find something else to do. I go look round  shops. When I see some clothes in the window I like, I would go in and try them . But I always finds it  not look nice on me. The other thing I don't like going shopping is in the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the articals like rubbish. Hang them every where after they tried  and  that  was not suit them. Also in the weekend shopping. You do can't find some where to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, the all full of people. However, shopping is nice to spend you leisure time and give yourself  to relax sometimes, but  suggest that never in the weekend. ",22.0
1053," Dear Mr. Robertson, I, as a head member of the students who participate in this year's trip to London, would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have developed for us. Specially, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries all around the world. Being London one of the most multicultural, multiracial cities, we cannot avoid the fact that is these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall (Tuesday March 14th) 10:00-19:00.). Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes in the fabulous Programme you have offered. These changes will not affect the contacts of the programme itself. The suggestion is to move the Tuesday shopping to Wednesday afternoon, which is free, and place there the visit to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, that is, on Tuesday afternoon. I also would like to remark that this change does not increment the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students. I want to thank you Sir for your time. Best Regards, The London Trip Group  [SEP]  ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is knocking at your door every day. It was 20 years ago  we were friends since  10. In those days we decide to be friends forever and work for the NASA. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done. The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas). Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it so. So, that, we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results. This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university. The task was not easy, with 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there was nothing to lose. It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding all our fingerprints. The operation was successful. Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system and new encryptation algorithms. ",30.00
1097,"  Mr Robertson; I am glad about  three days trip to London. I have seen your organasation for the trip. That is really intresting. Me and my class friends have seen ad advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really want to see that. This is the reason that I'm writing to you. The show is in 14th March on tuesday. It means on  second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning  untill 19.00. My friends told me that if we wake up early on tuesday we can go to  Science Museum  about 8.00 in the morning. Your afternoon plan is  shopping but we can do our shopping on Wednesday afternoon because we will have got  free time on Wednesday. I'd like to tell you something about the show. It is in  Central Exhibition Hall and it is free to students. It is  great opportunity for us because when we go there we will be aware of about  latest fashions news, we will see leisure and sports wear, all new make up designers (especially for girls) and different hairstyles. We are also enthusiastic about your sightseing in bus and  River trip to Greenwich on Monday and visiting to  National Art Gallery on Wednesday. I hope you will consider our suggestion about your trip. Your student  [SEP]  Futuristic Designs Of People's Homes Technology has been improved by human being rapidly. This technologic improvement is changing people's lifes, behaviours even their homes. Can you imagine? What people's homes will it be like in fifty years time? I guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier. Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no. Of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but otherwise we will get lazy, we will lose our abilities that we have now. Now IT (information technology) is in our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order from to  computer and someone will bring . It means we'll lose our social lifes. But we can't stop to  technologic improvement. We should use it in positif ways. When people use to the technology they should know that  is not everything. They should seek to other lifes outside their homes. I guess that with technology people will spend their life much more in their homes. It doesn't seem to me alright. Our homes should just protect us  dangeres from outside. But I believe human will never forget what they used to be. Mankind has been always seeking different things. We'are learning a lot of things about life. and we are practicing these . In the future life will be more artifitual than I had been before. Probably our homes will be smaller than now. Because  human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay  big cities (like London, New York, Paris). It means there will be too many people in small areas. Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all. That areas will just use for agriculture. Beyond the near future may be our homes will be  outer space it will be a spaceship. We'll travel around to space. It is just an imagination. We live in  changeable world. Like everything our homes will change as well. ",25.00
1220," Dear Mrs Smith, I was very please to receive your letter. It is my pleasure to help you  organising the international student conference. Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located on the town centre. Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach, as there are about 35 internation students,  they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at  college main hall, at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June. There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided. Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on. Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wearing pub-wears to it, as it is suitable for dancing. Finally, on the last day, I suggest you could go  the market at town during the 3-hour gap. It is a nice place to buy the British style gifts to your family and friends. You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby. I would be grateful to give any help if you need. I am looking forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From: Genevieve Chiu To: Group leader of  American students Subject: Interesting building to visit in Hong Kong Visiting Po Lin Temple The purpose of this  is to give information to the American students, describing Po Lin Temple is worth-visited. 1. Brief history of Po Lin Temple: It was found in 1910. It is a traditional type of chinese temple. Because of the 2nd World War, it was re-built in 1960. A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world. 2. Location: The location of Po Lin Temple is in Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong. 3. Opening and Closing time: Po Lin Temple is opened to  public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday. 4. Transports You could take the MTR (HK underground) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there. Then you need to take the bus A110, A111 or A112 to Po Lin Temple. It is quite convenient. All the buses and  MTR have air-condition. 5. Attractive points: You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos. Of course, you may get more knowledge about Hong Kong, as the temple have been here for nearly 100 years. The well known Big Buhha you mustn't miss it, or you will be sorry. The temple also provide free Chinese traditional style meals for visitors. 6. Conclusion: To sum up, I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit, especially for Americans students. Easy to get there and free amittion. On the other hand, Hong Kong is known as a highly commerical city, but you could find something different in Po Lin Temple. ",27.00
591," Dear Sirs, I cannot express how happy I was reading your letter about the prize I won and about 2 wonderful weeks I am going to spend at Camp California in the USA. With regard to your questions. First of all, I would be very happy if you could arrange my trip and stay at the camp for July. I will still be at school in June, and I am going to spend the whole  August on a training camp with my club. July is really the only available time I have. If possible, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin. I spend 3 weeks in a tent last year and it wasn't the best experience of my life. I would like to avoid tents if possible. You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train  it in August as well - I don't want to loose touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still on a beginner level. It seems like a good oportunity to practice it. Finally, I would appreciate  if you could send me some information about the weather in California at this time of year. I am a little concerned about the clothes that I should take. Does it rain a lot there? Another thing is money. How much money do you think I should take with me? Will you arrange a place where I could keep the money secure during my stay at the camp? I look forward to hearing from you and I can't wait going to  USA.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" In my humble opinion, shopping is one of he most stressful and boring activities people do in life. If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on  everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere on  top of the list. If it would be possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me. First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it's own idea of where it want's to go) between other desperate people baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste. Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that? No. Most definitely shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many, nicer ones. ",34.0
