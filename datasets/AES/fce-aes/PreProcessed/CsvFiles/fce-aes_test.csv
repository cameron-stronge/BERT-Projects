342," Dear Sir or Madam, I write you this letter to complain about your musical show. First of all, the show began three quarters of an hour late: it started at quarter past eight instead of half past seven, what of course was very bothering. I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appeared. He had been replaced by a really bad actor,  whom I don't even know the name. I was very disappoint of that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actor. There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets, what appeared to be wrong to. I had to pay the full prize for them, which was quite expencive. My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play. It turned  to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even received an explaination therefor. I had a really bad evening and would like to ask you for my money back. Waiting for your reply Yours faithfully Pierre Gaussier  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First off all, if computers haden't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of it! I use my computer for many things, such as homeworks, games, digital video or  Internet. The developpement of portable communication systems, such as mobile phones has greatly changed our way of life. It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen, even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other. Precision industry has changed my life a lot too. I practicate Scuba Diving during the week-ends and hollydays. That wouldn't have been possible a century ago, because all our material, such as dive computers, tanks or regulators didn't existed at that time. I think that we live easier now (thanks to modern medicine) and that our lives will get easier with the time. ",26.0
1126," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisment about The London Fashion And Leisure Show. First of all I would like to thank you for making such a good plan, for us, so we could have a good time. Then I would like to explain to you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show. Finally  how the programme could be changed. The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London and happens on Tuesday March 14. From ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the afternoon. The reason that I suggest that we go is that it is a great opportunity because we can see the latest fashions,  leisure and sports wear as well as make up and different hairstyles. In addition to these we will not have to pay anything since it is free for students. I suggest that we should transfer our visit to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon in our free time that we have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I had to do it. I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble. I had to become a burgler again and steal jewelry from the jewelry shop near by. As I knew the teknics to break in a place without being noticed, I should not be afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country which was very well secured. When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily was not. Then I approached slowly the door, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were laisers all over the place, with which I had to be careful with. Suddenly something went wrong, the alarm was making  noise. I ran towards the diamond grabed it got out quickly,  ran out of the back door. By surprise I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car  gave the jewelry in exchange of my brother, took him and left the place. ",26.00
59," Dear Ms Jane Clark I am writing to you because I have some suggestion about next year festival, and if it is possible I can give you some opinions about this year festival. Firstly, in your advertisement  states: stars and artist from around the world, and this year  one only from six countries It would be great if there was more artist  not only six. Secondly, the concerts are fantastic, especially  rock concerts. I very enjoy on it, but some of the halls are too small. I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied. Another thing,  plays and films. I saw only 2 plays and 3 films. For me it is too little. One of the reasons that I have visited your art festival was to saw a lot of plays In  future I supposed to be an actress and that's way I want to learn something from  professionalists. I hoe that next year I will. The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have  weekend-price. This is  excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it by  whole family at the weekend and see all events in  reasonaby-price I believe that you consider my opinions. If you can't consider all of then, I would like only one: more and once more plays! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Annabel Thank you for your letter, and I'm sorry I didn't write. I have examinations, but now I have plenty of time and I can write a letter to you. In your letter you ask me about  rules in school and home I have. I think that they are the same as yours, but I'm not sure at 100 per cent so I vrite :  Rules at school are: we must be on time at lessons,   always have make  homework. Everybody must be present at lessons. If someone is ill  must bring a paper from a doctor. And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to  teachers At home I must clean my room and vacuuming  home. I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows. I like clean my home, and I like  when there is clean and fresh. However I'm the only child and I don't have do too much but I want  and I like it. There is one thing I like to change,  the treatment students  by teachers. They want too much forstudent and are unkindly for them. That's all, I hope that I give you answers for all  questions you have. Give my best wishes to your family Bye ",23.00
832," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter. I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I can go only on July because I'm a student. It's summer holiday during that time. I want to know if it is avaliabile during that time. First of all I would be pleased if the accommodation is in  log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent. It'll make me like at the village. I like painting, and once I won first prize in the university competition. I think I'll have  chance to draw the pictures, and I'll show  my friends who have never been there before. Another activities I would prefer is sailing. My father was a sailor when I was child. I was draged  to learn sailing. I'm good at it. It would be exciting. Fathermore I would like to ask you which kind  clothes I need to take and how much money I'll spend. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Recently we have a class discussion about shopping. All of the students agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable. Women always enjoy shopping. But a lot of incovenients anoy them. So they said they do not always enjoy shopping. First of all the car parking is not convinent and  expensive. Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car. Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher place then walk to the supermarket. Futhermore when you look aroud the supermarket, you can't easyly find the goods which you want to buy. It's very confusing without  right singho. Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.  Otherwise men always don't like shopping, while their wives are doing  shopping they sit in the car or read  newspaper. They would be happy if there are sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket. They'll change their mind. Instead of hating shopping they will enjoying shopping. In my opinion nowadays shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24.0
1077," Sir Robertson, We are really appriciate  about giving  very nice program, which is organised by your this time. Especially  River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forwold to his.

Invent glass was very eventuly to architect. Architecuture with use of grass brough us the modenism in 1980. In the future we can expect having  new material and it will make our living more confortable and convinient. In Japan, crime of minority is increasing. It said that as one of the reasons  small separete room makes kids unsociable and dissapointed. Therefore Japanese architect consider designing of use many glasses as much as they can in house and try not to create speparate dark room. Otherwise as producing new electoronic, our home of  future will be more convinient. On the other hand  inside of the house will be too simple. Although  high might be still  same. Because human high won't change so much, unless 10000 years passed. ",17.00
477," Dear manager My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same since last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well  this musical. Then I was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start  that lasted forever and  was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I meant to go to the restaurant which occasionally was closed. By the time I thought: ""I want my money back."" That was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen. Attencionally Straussburg 17th June 2000  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Despite the fact that she was my best friend I could never count on her or she would tell everybody in high school all my secrets. Once, when we first met I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time  we found out  a very good friendship on our conversation. One day she came over to my house and we spoke all night about our lives. Then I told her about my first kiss (it was terrible, the guy didn't know how to do it) and things like that. The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience in kissing. People would be starring at me and laughing. I got really mad at her, but nowadays we are friends, not as close as we used to . I don't tell her my secrets anymore. ",23.0
946," Tuesday, 13nd June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I've just received the letter telling me that I've won first prize in your competition. I guess you can imagine how happy and excited I am at this time. Here are the few information about my stay at Camp California, that you asked my to complete: For the date of the travel, I wonder if it would be possible  in July because I'm going to pass a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great occasion for me to relax after that. You asked my to chose my accommodation between  tents and cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I made a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year) The activities listed in your letter seemded to be all interesting. I choosed to do baskelball (I play in a club, I have a good level) and  photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California). Talking about California, I suppose that the weather is hot there in Summer. Could you please tell me if I have to take  special clothes with me. If it's not two much to ask, could you also tell me how much money I should take with me for food or evening activities at the camp Looking for you to receive those information, Dominique  [SEP]  Last week I had planned to change my old basketball shoes. So I took the train to Lausanne (I live in Lavaux and it's impossible to find a corect pair of sneakers in this whole damned city!) to buy a new pair to play outdoor  this summer. After having visited  shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for. The shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive) So I went back to the station, very proud of me with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face. I stayed that happy during the travel, thinking of how cool I would look on the playground with my brand new shoes on. As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag, I had forgotten it in the train! How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play with old shoes for one more summer... ",25.0
1201," Dear Mrs Smith, Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information. We have already booked a 4 stars hotel -  Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames. It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train. The end-of-conference party will be held in an India restaurant, that is next to the hotel. It is surposed to be held during 7 pm to 11 pm. Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and  disco is also provided. You can wear anything you like, we would like you to be just yourself and have fun. As you know, our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year. There are so many things to do, unfortunately, there is just 3 hours. I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping. So you can buy gifts for your friends or families. I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts, please do not hestitate to contact us. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, our lives is becoming better and better. Lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely. If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television. ""Televisions is just an amazing invention."" My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are the other countries like, or even what language they speak unless we go to that country. Secondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as ""Learn follow me"" and ""Be good to others"". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child. The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't. If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, that's easy,  just turn on the television and enjoy myself. However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I do think televisions is the most important invention. ",32.00
825," Dear Helen Ryan I have just received your letter, and thank you very much for your reply. I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need: First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month. Secondly, if you don't mind, I would prefer to sleep in a tent. Although it is not very comfortable, I like camping very much. Thirdly, I am very interested in swimming and also climbing. I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on . I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city. Finally, could you tell me what I need to dress and also how much money I will spend on. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I have  asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable. In fact, to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons: Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in  few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes, which you don't really need. Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them. In my opinion, doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially  I am depressed, nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet. ",24.0

383," Dear Sir or madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"" that was advertised in this week's newspaper. According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring  but it was a different actor. It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time. It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it was not. It started fourty five minutes later. And if this were not enough, I had no discount in the ticket  as was written. Beside this, we where invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why  you make this invitation? On top of everything, I am on holidays and you can imagine how disappointed I am. It was not a perfect evening out. I suppose that you are understanding my situation, because you did not say the truth. I believe that you will be direct to blame and give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Caesara Rodrigos Los Arnos  [SEP]  Nowadays the modern technology is increasing and it was really affecting our daily life. Sometimes there  advantages but there  some disadvantages too. Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster. Beside this you can talk with a person in the other side of the world by a computer. It is interesting! Furthermore it helps in house works, at school and you can travel to places very quickly. So the main advantage of the modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier. On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems to our health. A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy. They have everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future. To sum up, there are both positives and negatives aspects of the modern technology, because it can makes our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us. ",26.0
219," Dear Sir or Madam I am writting to complain about I am really disappointed  your musical show which is ""over the rainbow"". on last week. I could compare between the advertising of  musical and  actual musical show last week. First of all, the advertising shown us starring, which is Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, however, when I had seem it, starring of  musical completely diffarent actors, I  really disappointed about it. Secondary, the advertising shows as the musical start  14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started  20:15, it's 45 minuts late, and also, I'd asked  discount ticket in the ticket counter, but there are not available any discount tickets. Finally, your theatre restaurant was closed after  show, it is because I saw it was opened at break time for musical, but afterwards, the people of staff for restaurant were closing. Now then, how was this advertising, it was completely diffarent, I am really disappointed  your musical, I am ask you for  money back, because I wasn't enjoyed your musical. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your Faithfully, from  [SEP]  I am writting  composition about ""How has modern technology changed your daily life"", this is our question. All at the technology developed about every day, not all of them, but still a lot of modern technology changed our daily life. First of all, I thought more than half  population of British has  ""mobile phone"", it is small and compact, much lighter than  home telephone, and one of the biggest advantage is you can carry it, so that   easy to contact your friend or someone who other, even they can easy to contact you as well, so you can phone anytime you wants, whenever you wants. Secondary, Personal Computer (PC), these ""Desk Top"" and ""Lap Top"" computers developed each year, however,  most important thing is  ""Internet"", Mobile phone could easy to contact anyone in your country,  ""Internet""  easy to contact  world wide, you can send E-mail anytime, anywhere you wants, it is  most popular thing  all of the world. These modern techonology get closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so that, these modern technology changed our daily life so diffarent. from.  ",15.0
410," 17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing . I was to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'. There I was  many problems. first of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up  to wait. The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different . They were worst than the previst actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious in spite of that. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am absolutely annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give  back  money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope  your answer soon. Finally, I want to say you this is the last time which I come to your theatre. Thank you. Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE I am going to write about what clothes will be worn in the future. I have gone out to the street and I have asked to people for this question. I have recollected all  answers and I have made this article. Most of people think that character people and clothes are together. They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amused, etc. I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon, very exciting. And people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will be more enjoyable than people  now because they will have many things to do. On the other hand, most of people in the future will wear glasses. It is because sunlight is very bad. At the end all people will be short-sight. In conclusion, I would like living in the future to check which clothes exactly they will wear. It is a point very interesting.  ",23.0
113," Manager of the Circle Theatre 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show ""over the Rainbow"" you presented  the 10 of this month. I read your advertissement five days before, and I was realy impressed by it. But, the quality of this show wasn't what you let understand, an I feel realy disappointed by it. I want to give you some details about my feelings. First of all, you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late. Then, I am a student, and when I bought my ticket, there wasn't any discounts. Finally, I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make my totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00. So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending ""Perfect Evening"". For all these reasons, and if you want to keep me  a costumer, I would be gratfull if you give me some or all  my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My marks wasn't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science, and the exam session was finished. There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma. You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story. In fact, I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming. The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam to succeed. That's why I decided to hack  the teacher's computers to change all my marks. I never talked about this project to anyone, exept my best friend Pat. At the end of the exam session, all students and teachers meet together for a big party, to celebrate it. During this party, Pat drank too much. And when he was totally drunk, he started speaking. Then, the teachers made copies of their file, and my project wasn't possible anymore. So congratulation everybody. And I think I will still be there next year. ",23.0
225," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complaine about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting ""Over the Rainbow"". It wasn't at all like what the advertisement for the show had promised. I will try to explain below: To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well. Then, they were not any discounts available for the tickets as it was written on the advertisement. What's more the theatre restaurant was closed for some reasons and we couldn't get anything to drink or eat after the show. On top of everything Danny Brook, the star of the night, was absent and his role was performed by a different actor. You can understand how disappointing this was for all of us. I am sorry but this wasn't my perfect evening out. I would like to ask for some refund because the whole evening was very disappointing and it did not worth the money given Yours faithfully  [SEP]  As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes rootly through the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be like 100 years from now In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns to be stricher and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too. This is how I think  fashion of the future will be like. The most exciting  about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange  as we don't think about ours . ",30.0
406," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir! I am writing this letter to you, because the show ""Over The Rainbow"" which is the London's newest and best musical show, was not... for me. Pleas apologise me, but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made, which disappointed me very . I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor  play in that show. And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage. Please, if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake. I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 not on 19.30. Other thing was that there was no discounts available, and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sikness. I would be very grateful if I could get my money back. That evening which should be my perfect evening out, was in fact very tireing and boring. Apologise me for disturb. I am looking forward for  answer! Best regardes!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, I knew that he's  very talkative person, but it was nessesery because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday party for tenes.

I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign ""Do not tell Agatha about that, this is a suprise party for her, please keep the secret!"" Pat arranged  great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breath taking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in  disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exaiting!!!

400," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the musical show I had seen yesterday, called 'Over The Rainbow'. Firstly, I was disapointed, because the actor Danny Brook did not appeared in the show. Then, another thing I would like to mention is that the time advertised was wrong, because the show started at 20:15. Another thing is that there were discounts on the price of the tickets, and I did not have any discount. It also puts that there was a restaurant to eat in after the show, but it was closed because it was not completely built. Finally, I would like to know why  would have a perfect evening, because I did not have one, so I would like to have my money back. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future. Yours faithfully, Juan Almo Dali  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day, when Peter and Pat were alone in class, he confessed  her that he was gay. She got very surprised when Pat told her that he was gay. During the week Pat and Peter talked about the problem he had and the consequences that will occured if he told it to his parents. On Saturday Peter, Pat and some other friends went to the cinema. When they saw the film, Katy and John approached to Peter and told him that they will continue being his friends. Peter got very angry and told Pat why did they say that to him. Pat did not answer to him. The next day all the school knew that Peter was gay and even though he didn't mind what happened he didn't talked with Pat no more in his life. ",26.0
1169," 12 June 2001. Dear Maria Smith, I receved your letter and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group, it's nice and quiet. I'm sure you'll be fine here. We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes. When you go out of the Hotel turn right and go stright on, at the first crossroads turn right again. At the end of this street you can see our college on your left, it's a green building. At the end-of-conference party it'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, it'll be some picturs of our college, you'll see al the generations who passed  here. The wears aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans. Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do, but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum. We all are looking forward to seeing your group. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TELEVISION What would our world be without television? It isn't easy giving an answer at this question. Television is an important invention, it permitted us to better our way of communication. This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world. Television has affected the ""all days life,,, too. We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs, all what we have to do is watching. And we like that, because it's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something. So television can be a positive or a negative invention, it depends on which use we want to do of this box. Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question. No, I don't think so. Television has become so important for us that we can't thinking that it couldn't exist. ",23.00
493," Dear Sir: I'm writing to you to complain about last evening musical show. I was very happy to see your musical show but I have to say that it has been a very disappointing evening. At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform without any explictions , and the show should started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!! I was sure that discouts were available because I have read it , but at the tickets office they didn't accept them. What a terrible evening! So I payed  the ticket. After the show I was hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed! It wasn't my perfect evening out so I'd like to have my money back! Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train. Jim's mum didn't want him to take her suitcase, but he did it. So a morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and take the train for the countryside where he had to work. But when he walked out  the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train. Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it. He was worried about his mother's reaction, but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager's office and he found it on the table. He was so happy! All this story was a secret but Pat realived  to his mother. She was so angry and confused because Jim haven't told her the truth. ",26.0
334," Dear Manager, I am writing in order to complain about the Musical Show, OVER THE RAIN, I went to see to the theatre. In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook, and to my surprise it was a different actor, and it realy disapoint me. Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour later. I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there werent. And the restorant of the theatre was being pait, so I could not go  as you said in the advertisment. As you may undertand it was not a perfect night and I am not pleased with the show on eaven with your services. That is why I am going to ask you  my money back. I am look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Tecnology, are we prepeared for those advances? It change every days and I do not know if we will be able to understand it. Tecnology improves our lives, we have tecnology for cook, for work, for study, well hardly for everything. Mostly all of us, today know what  is internet about, but one or two year ago we did not. And when we understand  internet, we thought that meeting people from other countrys and could ""chat"" with them, was the top of the tecnology. But now we can eaven watch his face ,  Internet is amaizing. and now of courese there will  someone trying to improve it. Tecnology change our daily life, it makes our life easily to live and of courese more confortable like with computers, televitions, radios etcetera and some times more secure like in medicine. Definitly we should try to understand tecnology, if we know how to use it, tecnology will improve our way of life. ",22.0
886," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have recently received your letter informing   I won a two-week-holiday prize at the Camp California. Enclosing  information you asked for, there are some points, I want to point out. First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of the June so I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in  tents  than  log cabins. Since I was a child, I have been intrested in camping and sleeping under the tents. If I can participate on swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful. I have been swimming for 8 years for a club and enjoying  a lot. I am afraid, I am not good at photography but I want to improve it. I need some more information about the camp life and also I would like to know what I need to take with me. For exemple, how much pocket money will be enough and which kind of clothes I should wear.. I hope to receive your reply soon. I am really looking forward to going  this camp. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Subject: Suggestion about lessons and activities  should be filmed. A - Lessons English It is one of the most popular subject in the school. Also, because this video is their project, it should be filmed. Drama Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons, it is not very well known. Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July. Part of the show can be filmed. Maths Regarding that the school's maths team won the this year's city's maths competition and is going  to the national school's maths championship, it will be  good idea to film some of their training course and also ordinary maths lesson where the majority of the students attend. B- Social Activities To show the life at the school  is not only lessons and exams, the video should  be inclued the annual summer Fete,  school's weekend trip which is on Friday 7th of July and also the dance which is organized on the last day of the school year.

55," Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to you to tell you that I enjoyed the International Arts Festival held on 21-22 November this year. I liked the plays and the films most. Some films were really wonderful. You had picked up unknown but talented directors' films and they were really worth watching. And the concerts were also excellent. Especially, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore. However, I found some things which I think I should point out. Some concert halls were not big enough to have the audience. For next year, I think you should take this matter into consideration, And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films. I will definitely go to the festival next year, too. To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments on it. Best regards.  [SEP]  A Japanese folk story ""a bamboo princess"" There was an old married couple. They had no children. One day, the lady went to a river to wash  clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees. In a bamboo forest, he found a shining  bamboo. When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it. She was named  bamboo princess. The princess grew up  beautifully. Some princes proposed  her. But she said to them, ""if you want me, you have to do this."" and asked them to do impossible things because she didn't want to get married. One day, the old couple saw the princess crying. When they asked her , she said ""I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon"". They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her. But, one the day, the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her. This story happened a long time ago. ",29.00
1228,"  Mrs Maria Smith, I'm pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference. The hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc. To get from the hotel to the conference, you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne, and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet, Divonne. When you come out, just go on your right, and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school. The end-of-conference party will take place at the same place. Some musicians will play classical music, and there will be many different drinks and food. you should wear some formal clothes, but not necessary really pretty clothes For three hours, you could visit the museum of the Red Cross, which is very interesting. I hope that these informations will help you Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  The portable phone, a very useful invention! During all mankind history, there were discovers who tried to make human life better, but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made. When the phone without  cable was invented, one wasn't sure if it would be a success or not. But the research went on, and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful. The portable phone is an important invention, because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem. Moreover, some portable phones have a connection to the web, so it is easy to read  newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it. Personally, the portable phone has affected my own life, because when somebody is phoning  at home, I don't have to rush to take the phone, being afraid that it's too late. I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still don't have a portable phone. ",31.00
259," Dear sir, I'm writing  you to complain about the disappointing expirience I had with your theatre. First of all, I arrived at about 19:20 because  advertisement said that performance begins at 19:30, but it wasn't till about 20:15 that the begin of the show and I had to wait  entire hour which was not very amazing. Secondly, I was supposed to have a discount but there were no discounts, although the advertisement said there are. Thirdly, the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why. And at last, the most disappointing point, the advertisement again said that there would be Danny Brook, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him. So, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that  advertisement promissed. As things went that way, I want my money back. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I shall have a look into the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen. How much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make even  cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use  different kind of cooling  and will tell you if your forgot to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to  devices modern technology offers us. ",33.0
1055," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing on behalf of  students in your English class. Firstly, we are please and would like to thank you for your arrangement to taking us to London for 3 days. Unfortunately, some students have seen an advertisements for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we  all like to go to the show. This show will be taken place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March at 10.00 - 19.00, which include the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is a great opportunity to visit  because it is shown only twice a year and the entrance is free for students. Furthermore, most of us are designers so this might help to up-dated their knowledge as well. Therefore, I would like to suggest that on Monday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March, we still stick with your plan. We might change the schedule on Tuesday 14 March, from visiting  Science Museum to The London fashion and Leisure Show. I would appreciate  if the matter can be settled down easily and look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I remember when I was in secondary school. At that time, my friends and I was so daring and full of energy. One day before  exam, we were so excited and frighten because we weren't ready for  exam. We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk. One of my friend came up with the idea that we had to steal them. The question was who would be the person do this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me. I was so scare and frighten because if I was caught I would be punished. However, I had to do it otherwise my friend would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it. So, that afternoon in lunch time, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely and calmly. Finally, I was succeed in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it back without anyone saw me. That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood. I wouldn't have imagined  if I had been caught. ",30.00
892," June, the 13th 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, You can guess how an enjoyable surprise receiving your letter was for me. I am glad to send you the items required. First of all, I must precise that I can only leave during the month of July owing to the job I obtained for August. After considering your accomodation offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible. I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping, however I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort two weeks long. Moreover, I must recognize that the activities offered are really attractive so it's hard to make up my mind. On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during  leisure times. Even if the photograph made are modest work, I am really interested in this activity. Then, as low  my level of   basketball is, I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time. So it will be pleasant for me to practice this activity. Your letter indicates that the pride includes that some costs are paid. Nevertheless I would like you to precise what I eventually need for this travel. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What obviously appears about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes. Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times that make our life. To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown at first. It evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché; that can not lack. A philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it. Next, students during the pause in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with   the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video. Furthermore two moments could have a role. First of all, the arrive of every students, namely the picture of the school without anybody at first, and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life. Then, the opposite situation, that is to say the scene of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make a parallel. ",25.0
795," Dear Miss Ryan: I received your letter about the two weeks at Camp California. I am writing back in response to your requests and because I have some questions also about those two weeks. First of all, I would rather travel in July, and if it's possible, during the first two weeks because I will be starting college at the end of the summer and therefore I have a lot of paperwork to get done. About the accomodations I would rather stay in a log cabin. I am not that much of a ""nature"" person and besides I have been feeling a little sore for the last few days and it would be better for my back than a sleeping bag. I would like to play tennis and  surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis. I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then. I couldn't say the same about surfing though I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it. And one last thing I would like to know about which kind of clothes should I take, if I have to take some money with me and if there are any expenses I have to pay at the camp. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate about writing or calling me. I will be waiting to hear from you Sincerely, Lolita A.S.  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing fine, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe  last month!!! I helped Korn in a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy in a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe, you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they pleased. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even took pictures with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all.

731," Dear Ms. Ryan I am writing in response to the letter, which I had yesterday. I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give   details, which you would like to know. First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only on July. Because I have to work all year except one month holiday on July. Secondly, I would be appreciate  if I could stay in log cabins at Camp. I feel that it would be fabulos places with  western design. Most of all, I am really interested in doing two activities. I am very good at Tennis. However, I haven't had any idea about sailing. So, I would like to try both of them. Lastly, I would be grateful if I could have  following informations. I would like to know about  clothes, which are suitable for activities. As well as that, I wonder if I have to take some money for extra activities and  few more things. Thank you for  time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you. yours sincerely Jae Hwa. Kim.  [SEP]  There was a meeting to talk about a video about daily life at our school. It was thought that a normal, regular lesson, 3 optional lessons and a great deal of activities should be filmed. Refering to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming. I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn. There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting,  photography should be included. It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school. As well as that, if we filmed famous students and teachers in our school, it would be a fantastic video. In my opinion, students can learn English from wide activities as well as lessons. That's why they prefer to film a lot of activities. ",30.0
387," Dear Manager I'm writing to complain about  poor administrations of your theatre. Because the advertisement for  show and the real show were completely different. First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on your advertisement but when I sat  my seat,  different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing for seeing them as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages. In addition, when I entered into the theatre I couldn't have  discount in spite of   student and I couldn't use in your restaurant either after the show. In that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. It's nonsense, wasn't it? Anyway, it was not ""My perfect Evening out"" but I think that it was a kind of ""contract infringement"" so I would like to ask for my money back. I look forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Of course, our life will be completely changed. However, we have to consider about our nature and human-being. First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now. All your stuffs will be performed by the computers. For example, if you watch ""The Star Trek"" - science fiction programme on TV, you will realise that you just can say ""Do it"" and then the computers will do it. However, there are some problems. If all your staffs are fulfilled by the computers, we might be idler than now. Moreover, we have to consider about our nature. As you know, even now, science and technology are destroying our environment, for example weird temperature etc. If we don't protect our environment, our daily life will not be convenient. Rather our daily life will be deteriorated. To sum up, future civilization is important for us. If there is no our good nature, our daily life will be unhappy. ",27.0
4," Dear Jane Clark, the organiser of  International Arts Festival I'm one of the citizen that enjoyed the last International Arts Festival. Most of  attractions are excellent, but I'd like to point out that  ""quality is high, but  quantity is not enough!. First of all, the only ""six countries"" doesn't mean ""around the world"". I suppose you had difficulty to manage the schedule. Second, some concert hall were too small, so some  audience couldn't concentrate  to listen to the music. And others couldn't enter the hall. But  ""All in one ticket"" was a good idea. In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is  wasting  time. I pressume if the term becomes longer the festival become more excellent. Because it's easy to manage the artist schedule and  audience can enjoy the live. I'd like to go to the Festival again!  [SEP]  Thank you for your letter. And I'd like to answer for your question. AT first, in Japan, generally school rules are more strictly than  home's. The gap between them is tremendously big! I can say the action which is prohibitted at school is no problem at home. Because the purpose of school rules is not only  discipline but also unify. Here, I write down one of the rules at my school. ""Whenever the students wear an extra  cloth (because of  cold or something) his or her (not  students!) parents write down an application form with their authorized signatures"". You will ask me why, the reason is the above...""unify"". In addition ""the students must not use any commercial paper bags (received at  department store etc)"". Now you know the reason! Needless to say I'd like to change such ridiculous rules, because such rules are not for us. They are for teachers'! Don't you think so? Do you have any rules at school that make you upset? If you have please tell me. Yours faithfully ",22.00

The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow. For the conference, I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important persons of others colleges. At the end of the conference, all students and leader will have a drink. To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk on the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful. I hope I give you enough details. I look forward to meeting you on the conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The building called in French ""Le Centre Pompidou"" is a very surprising monument. It's a modern building with an architecture that you can't see in  other place. What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building. On the Pompidou's center, there are different expositions on different themes. In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures. This expositions are often very attractive and they change every year. Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view on the city. So if you visit Paris, the Pompidou's center is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many others buildings. ",27.00
471," 17 June, 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I visited your theatre a couple of days ago in order to see the musical show titled 'Over The Rainbow'. I was not satified with the show at all because it was very different from the information your advertisement had stated. First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation . Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner. I had planned to have dinner there after the show. What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time during my holiday in London. I do hope you will understand my feelings and send some money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had known that but I told my secret to her, which was a big mistake. It was just an usual day. Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin. Pat was very surprised but soon she began asking me lots of questions about him. I didn't mind telling her about my cousin, actually he isn't different from other boys at all, he just has sweet-looking. Next day, I went to school as usual and got agog at a large number of girls waiting for me around my rocker. They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend. Now I'm asking my cousin either to meet my friends, or to quit being a singer right now. ",33.0
1167," Dear Mrs Smith, I am applying  your letter where  you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is situated in the city center, at 15 minutes walking from where the conference take place in. In the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College. The conference will start at 7 p.m, the same day we expect, the 18th of June. Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks, drinks and music. For the people  interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke. Everybody should wear formal clothes, at least, a little bit formal. No jeans and tee-shirts. There is a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough. We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the river side, which is the best if it is a nice day, sunny an warm, for take a walk. For any details look in the next page map. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Alice knew that is was going to be a very special day for her. She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special. So, she took the bus, like every morning, and she went to school. But that day was a little bit different: she had her maths exam. She had never passed an maths exam and she was really nervous. Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea. She sat down and what a surprise she found a lottery ticket. Nobody was around her, so she took the ticket. Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place. She did the exam really well, she was very surprised, and after the exam she went home. She spend the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock. At the time, she turned on the TV and while the lottery's man was shouting  the winning numbers, she checked hers and what was the surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same!! She win £500!!!

20," 16 December 2000 Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an excellent organisation of an annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows. However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Besides, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones. As a matter of fact, I consider one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events to be brilliant as it offers a unique opportunity to pay for everything all together and be able to attend different events. I believe your festival to be a great event in our cultural life and I am convinced that it is a success. I look forward to coming to the festival again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Wuthering Heights - Emily Brontë For a start I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook,  they make us feel and think. As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and  people around us. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of  everyday's routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters,  reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses  irresistable fascination. To draw the conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastic stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves. ",38.00

Firstly, concerning  stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics like jazz and rock it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about  bigger halls, it will be better. Secondly, about  plays and films it will be good if you make more because the children like it. The dance shows was very wonderful like art exhibitions. Do not change about  talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their owns books. Finally, concerned the price for the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less stress, so they can visit  more longer. It will be better, if we can make this festival at the end of summer. I hope  to give you enough information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It began when my parent sand I were going to the South of France for  holidays. We took a  car. When we were near Geneva, my father who was driving the car, had been flashed by a radar and the police stopped him. After that,  it maked a long time that he drove, so we decided to stop to an  area. We were going to the toilet and ate something to the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he forgot to close the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggages. We called the police but they said  us  if you didn't close your car we didn't make something. It was  the worse holiday in my life but we continued. When we arrived at the flat, it was eleven o'clock. The agency was closed and we hadn't  the key. We went to an hotel, it was expensive and uncomfortable. Finally,  the life in France are crasy, this is the tradition. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
1129," Dear Mr Robertson. It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thanks  for organising a school trip to London. We have seen the programme list and we all think it will be enjoyable. Especially to the science museum because we  all doing science in school. Recently, some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London. it will be on the 14th and we all want to go. So, it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show. This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show And it is free for students. it will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show. So could you give us permission to go? We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed. We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon. So we can do shopping instead. Then, we can go to the show during that period We are all looking forward for you answer. faithful 12-12-00  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Because there was a man  had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him. Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes. I was thinking 'what should I do?' I haven't got my mobile phone with me And I was half way between my school and home. At that time he was unconcious, I kept asking myself 'should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him. I was struggling because I knew if I didn't help him, he would die in a short time. I decided to do something to this man, my first move was to check  was there any solid or liquid which could blocked his breathe. And  checking his body condition. After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars. I ran back home for help. I phoned to  police And told  the whole story. The strange thing happened to me, when I got back to that man. The car and the man were not there anymore. Where could they be? I was wondering. Oh, sorry they were not in this road, they were in the next road. ",29.00
236," Dear Mr Manager of the Circle Theatre During my last holiday week in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement of the ""Over the rainbow"" show. I wanted to spend my leisure time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all in the advertisement  was written, as I had read that before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, the different actor stood in for in it. The time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p.m. and at half past seven that evening, again. Lack of my time made me to go at the evening show. And unfortunately again, from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement  was exactly written  some of the discounts of the tickets. No, alas in reality it appeared  a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough yet. At the end of the advertisement as I noticed it was said something of  perfect evening out. It wasn't truth. That's why I write my letter to you and I ask for my money back. I was expecting something really better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet at the court. Yours faitully  [SEP]  I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life. Looking back in the past, I can see, how big  difference  is between  life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so far as we could now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now, at present days. They could not communicate with someone living in other country, often located far away from his own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or  internet, we have a better access to a lot of different news. So, we are in  better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared  last years. For example a lot of pollution has raised. We now breathe worse air in our lungs, then our grand-parents breathed. I think, we are more addicted to do some things, which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watch TV or often using the mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe, that we are the part of wildlife. And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but determinly might destroy us. ",28.0
1056," Dear Mr Robertson, You may be surprised to receive a letter from us. All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey, to visit London for three days. This trip would gives us the change to see London and to improve the english language. We all agree to the daily programme during the three days. In the morning, we will have the change, to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus, For example the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery. In the afternoon, the River trip to Greenwich would also be a fantastic experience for us. The reason I write to you, is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, for a fiew days. It would be exciting, if we had the possibility, to go to the show. The show includes the latest fashions in the sports clothing and the most fashionable make up and hairstyles. We all think that the London fashion and Leisure show will be a great opportunity for us. The show is free for students and we can see the show instat of having free time  Wednesday in the afternoon. We all thank you for your help. We send you our regards. The student  [SEP]  Ourdays, with the help of the media famous people, like a politician or filmstars, plays an important rule in our community. It is also normally,  that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially from their private . Who got married, who got divorsed or who had a remarkeable changing of his complexion, these are questions, who most journalists are interested in. But what  life is it, when you even can't go to a restaurant  being afraid of, the journalists,  will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people diserve also to have a private life. It is a right like everybody from us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. Is it normally when you are a star, that everybody wants to know all about you. We shoudn't forget, that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media! I think nobody have forgotten, where  curiosity from the journalists end. For example  the hunting about Princess Diana and his friend. I hope that they will  punished for what they done! ",25.00
564," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am very happy to be the winner of the competition and I am looking forward to come to Camp California. I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have. From August, in fact, I will start with a new job and I will not be able to live Rome for a long period. As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because tents are too hot for me. I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do so. So, I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them. Please let me know how is the climate like at the Camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes. It would be also useful for me to know if there will be some extra expenses, in order to take enough money for two weeks. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vittoria Santini  [SEP]  Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops, try on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally go back home with dozens of bags in your hands. However, there are a few moments in which you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because  shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other month's. Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress  and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes. Anyway, apart from these two cases, shopping is always very amusing. ",35.0
506," Dear Sir/Madam I have visited your theater and I was very dissapointed because of the number of reasons. I've read your advertisment and in reality to what was written there was different. There was no Danny Brook but instead of him  was a different actor and I'm very dissapointed about it because I'm his fan. The show started much later, on 45 minutes later than it should be so I was late for the bus. There were no discounts availible so I overspended the money. The theater restaurant was closed for no reason availble to me. It was a realy bad evening and because of it could you possibly give  my money back? Because it was just a waste of money to go to your show. Yours Faithfully Vaisili Solatov  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this. We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon. He was one of the first people who I get know. After a few days he was already my best friend. Everything was going perfectly befor last month when I met a girl from the other school. Her name was Marine. I saw her as a perfect girl with who I fallen in love with. So one day she offered to me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal. I had decided to go. So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climed out of the window. Unfortunately for me Pat at the time went to  toilet and saw me. So I asked him to keep it in secret. I came back at 6 o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again. Next day my best friend went to  headmaster and told him about me so he gave me a sespend. ",24.0

I was disappointed when I found the actor wasn't Danny Brook! And from your advertisement, the show should start at 19.30 but it didn't. It was 45 minutes late! And also I couldn't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement, it said 'discounts available' I was really annoyed by that! After the show, we expacted to eat something in your restaurant, but it  closed! I have no idea why! We had a really unenjoyable time at your theatre. And I would like to know if it  posible to have the money back. Thank you very much and I look forward to hear from you. Yours centainly, Porawek Phowrung.  [SEP]  Unfortunately Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. So one week later all  student in my class knew that I was an angle. Certainly! Nobody believed her... neither me. But it's true... I'm an angle and I wanted to visit the earth. It's easy to do but the only one rule was I can tell my secret to only one person. And if someone elso knows, I won't be able to go back to the heaven unless I kill the person who told my secret. Pat was the only person who I told my secret  but now it has become a joke! I promised to myself... I would have to kill her! I started my plan. I went to Pat's house but her brother told me that she wasn't there. I offered to wait... Her brother and I began to talk... He's such a nice boy. I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too... We started to go out in the same time as I started to change my mind. I don't want to go back to the heaven anymore as long as I am with him. ",26.0
375," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week holiday. While there I saw your advertisement for the show ""Over the rainbow"" and decided to go. I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, it was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available,  as it was mentionned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else. After the show was over, it was not possible to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed that day. I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you  a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed. Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say  changed it. I will take the exemple of the use of the internet. I use it on a daily basis for many different reasons: I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail through the internet and the person received it within seconds. I don't need to go to the stores anymore, if I don't want to: I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it: books, video tapes, clothes and even groceries. It is also possible to read the news or play games. I also have the possibility of making new friends: I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people. ",38.0

513," Dear Sir: How are you? I have been  the musical show ""over the rainbow"" in your theatre last week. I have got a few things to complain about  your theart. The first thing is in your note  says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show. But in the show, there was a another actor. I was so disappointing, because I came  far away to see Danny Broke. In the note  also says that the show start at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25. The show was started at 20:15, which means it has wasted one hour of my time. Note says that tickets has discounts available, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for  thicket. When the show is finished. I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant, But I went there and it is closed for some reasons. I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can. The note says that your perfect evening out, I thought I could get my money back, with your poor service and all my reasons, But it was not ask for money back. I was really disappointed about your threat and service, I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it. Than you for reading .   [SEP]  Today, science and technology help us a lot. For example. In the pass, people have to go and get wood, make a fire and cook, but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work. Science and technology can give us a better live style or better food. For example, before people have to walk from a place to the other, but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrel transport and we can transport with them faster. We also can produce more and better food or using science and technology. e.g.  use science to put all the good part of two plants into one plant. We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster. Science and technology can also used for some material e.g. steel or iron, which use for our building, it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy. Science and technology can give us a lot of good thing for our daily life, make us easy to do thing or work. ",20.0
948," Thank you very much for the prize. I turned crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition. I am just looking forward to going to Camp California. I've never been in the States before and having the chance to do it so makes me real happy. So let's answer the question you told me to in order to make that two weeks there as  funnier as possible. You asked me when would I like to travel to California. Definitely, in July. That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope just the sleeping one. That's the best suitable accomodation for a camping . It just keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience with the putt. I just hope not to get injured. One thing you have not told me is weather I have to pay  all things by my own in California or not. Please, let me know. Waiting for your answer, José  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part on the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me in the task, but that did not make it much easier. Any way, it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me. It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that. They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live. Great show. Next time come with me. I think Ernestina is coming to the city very soon. See you then! José ",34.0

Some people when they are in a sadness, they will go shopping to forget every thing and the fact is that every body knows how to shopping. If you have chilldren, you will know it very well  when you are busy doing something and the chilldren see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometime they even cry or shout to you and it is really anoy you. However they are happy after they have it. Anyway, even in families they usauly have this problem that when they bought a new one, suddenly they have a problem that where the old one is going to be and that is the begining of  argument between mother and farther or parents and chilldren. Eventually I like shopping to and I beleive every body like shopping, but before you buy something think before  you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough meney for survive.

We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel. That is the best option because it is placed less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center. When you live a hotel you have to turn right and you bloun the street. At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building. That's our Conference Center. At the hotel reception you will find printed information  how to get over there. As you know at the end-of-conference there is a party. Party is due to start at 8 p.m  until 3 a.m. There is  2hr break between  end-of-conference and  party. At this time you and your group can refresh yourself. I would like to mention that because  our conference that is dress-code party. Hope you will enjoy it. We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and  hot or cold buffet. About you're the last question I can sugest to visit the Royal Castle. That will give you and your guests an impression about our country and history. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  In our town there is so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one. In my opinion the most interesting is the Castle. It is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it. Just look up and you will see that huge building. Actually it is a whole complex, the Old and the New Castle,  Cathedrall and the most interesting undergroud part with it's amazing crypts. And if you climb on the top of the main tower - the keep  you will see unforgetable view on a white toun. After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle. You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon, armores and, we are especially pround of it, the great collection of swords. After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle . I am sure that should be enought for  one day trip. For you information I can say that at this time we have  five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display. That should complete that amazing day. ",25.00

810," 12 Barcicka Str. 45-139 Warsaw 13 July 2000 Dear Ms Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter I received yestarday. I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At the beginning I would like to answer  questions you asked me in your letter. The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off (I am in charge of  project which starts in June so I am sure I couldn't go later). 'As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in  photograher's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in  cathegory of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started  few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would like also to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is. I want to thank you ones more for taking me into consideration in your competition. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Juliana Piotrowska  [SEP]  Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end. What did you feel? You had to be disappointed. There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time. Moreover, you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager. This leads to an escalation of your anger. Sometimes you could find a bargain. You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price. But at home you noticed that there is a tear on  sleeve. And you couldn't of course give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee. You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money. Somebody could give you not enough change. How would you feel? Deceived? So if you don't want to feel deceived or offended, think twice before you decide to go shopping. (A very depressing point of view, isn't it?) ",36.0

The hotel is just three busstops away from our college. So you and your students can take the bus from the central busstation that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference. The end-of-conference party starts just one our after the end of the conference. It is located in our sports hall. There will be live music and a midnight dinner. So you don't have to appear very noble dressed, just as you like it (there is no order - you may wear what you want). For your last day I think it would be interesting to vistit our historical and famous city-centre. I will organize a tourist guide to give us information about the old buildings and sights. If you have any more questions write me a short letter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The invention of the car was a great point in history. From there on people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted. Of course within the physical barriers. People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home-countryside. In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there. It has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city. I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go. Today I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work and to meet my friends at any place and any time. So with my car I achieved a great freedom.  ",31.00

Instead of shopping on Tuesday afternoon we'd like to go to this show, which will continue till 7 o'clock in the evening. We all expect the trip to London to be exiting and hope to get unforgettable memories Best regards your students  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Our life is changing every day. New technological inventions bring us new cars, new planes, new houses. Future is almost unpredictable. But what if we'll try to imagine how our house will look like in the next 50 or 100 years? Will we all live in  countryside in house surrounded by forest full of animal life? Or would be our house itself alive? With new computer technology nothing is impossible. The scintist could invent the 4'th dimention and we'll get unlimited space inside the house. It is already predictable, that very soon all house appliances will be voice controlled. You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you'd like to wear, your hob will cook your preferable meals and your refigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food. Lots of changes could be done in the future, but the main purpose of the house - to keep comfort and safety, to place for you to relax and feel at home, - will remain. ",30.00
1053," Dear Mr. Robertson, I, as a head member of the students who participate in this year's trip to London, would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have developed for us. Specially, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries all around the world. Being London one of the most multicultural, multiracial cities, we cannot avoid the fact that is these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall (Tuesday March 14th) 10:00-19:00.). Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes in the fabulous Programme you have offered. These changes will not affect the contacts of the programme itself. The suggestion is to move the Tuesday shopping to Wednesday afternoon, which is free, and place there the visit to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, that is, on Tuesday afternoon. I also would like to remark that this change does not increment the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students. I want to thank you Sir for your time. Best Regards, The London Trip Group  [SEP]  ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it."" Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger is knocking at your door every day. It was 20 years ago  we were friends since  10. In those days we decide to be friends forever and work for the NASA. I remember it as if it were yesterday. We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done. The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas). Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it so. So, that, we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results. This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university. The task was not easy, with 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there was nothing to lose. It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding all our fingerprints. The operation was successful. Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system and new encryptation algorithms. ",30.00
203," To the manager, Lately, I had the oportunity to go to yours Circle Theatre event. Unfortunatly I never thought it could be so dissapointing. It started when I received the advertisement on the street. According to that, I thought I'd have a wonderful night. The first problem happened at the box office because there were abosolutly no discounts available. Well, I bought a the ticket anyway. The show supposed to start at 19:30 but it actually started forty five minutes after it. When the show began  had my biggest disappoint, instead of the great Danny Brook, there were another actor, totally unknown. After the show I was so nervous about the whole thing that I decided to eat at the restaurant and try to relax a little. From my surprise, it was closed. According to all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly one of the worsts. I'd like so, to reiceve my money back. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Techology is always getting better. And it is responsable for many changes in my life, and I think I wouldn't be able to live without it anymore. Nowaday, with  Internet it had became easier to do the school works and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favorite football team. I also got recently a celular phone and I don't now  I lived so long without one - because it help to solve the problems so quickly, it's really amazing. But for me, the best thing is definatly the microwaver. And there is a quite good reason for it. I live alone, so I have to cook my own food, and I'm the worst cooker in the whole world. There are some of the   modern techonologys that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me. ",28.0
484," Dear Manager, I am writing this letter to remind you  some faults of your theatre. I think this will help your organization to improve itself. From my point of view, your organisation has to be careful to orginize an activity. Last week I was in London. I attended to your activity. I'm sorry but I didn't have a good remark of your activity when I left. I know the quality of your organization. That's why I wanted to write  you. First time, when I saw the advertisement on the newspaper, I really appreciated. I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible. Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling. Finally, time passed and it was supposed to begin. But it didn't. I waited 45 minutes more to see the play. Anyway, it wasn't important for me. Because, I believe that if you want to get a satisfaction you have to sacrifice a little bit. But it wasn't all. On the other hand, I couldn't see the same actors whose name were written on the advertisement. I was really shocked. Because from my point of view the buildings of a play are the actors. It was unpleasent for me to see different actors on the stage. In addition, you didn't keep your promise which   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But Beatrice didn't think so. That's why she came across with so many problems. They were best friends. Beatrice was thinking so. When she came to school, first, we wanted to warn her. On the other hand Beatrice and her family were our next door neighbours. I knew her family better than everyone else. Her father never let her to have a boyfriend. Yes, it was a strange behaviour. Beatrice was 18 and she could manage. But her father didn't have the same opinion. That's all I knew about her. Days passed. Beatrice and Pat were going everywhere together. Pat had a boyfriend. That's why Beatrice's father never liked Pat. One day Beatrice came  me with some tears on her face. She was crying. I couldn't believe . Because I got used to seeing her every time cheerful and laughing. But this time the situation was inversed. When she came, I was studying for my final exam. She asked if we  spoke a little bit. We went out and she told me all her story. I was shocked. She had told Pat that her father hadn't let them to be friends anymore. After that, Pat had told everyone that Beatrice's father  ",25.0

I would like to answer. The only one term for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA on July becouse on August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights in hol. on July are hot. Tent will be more cooler to sleep  then the cabin. You offer a great veriety of activities. My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball. I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer. Basketball is the game which I love.

Yours sincerely K.  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops. We could only buy things from Russia. People alwas queued for stuff from  west. If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night. It was the worst side of shopping in Poland  couple  years ago. Nowadays we have capitalism, free market lots of privete shops, markets and super-markets. We can buy everything what about we imagine. Polish super market are not Polish origin shops. They are imported from enother Western Europe country. I apprieciate this shops for lots of products, cheep prices end big spaces. But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread. On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are crowded. They are filled by people who went buy everything. I do not like crowded places. This is the reason why I do not like shopping. ",27.0

13," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing this letter to give my opinion on the last International arts festival. Firstly I found amazing the number of starts and artist who came to the festival although they where from only six countries around the world. The concerts and the dance show were incredable, except for the classical concert that   halled to small. Secondly the plays and films were very good organized despide being  short number. I suggest  to do a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new life style and society, it was totaly different from ours. The talks by writers were very tecnic but it could be understood by all the people who were in the festival In conclusion, I am impresed on all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price has been excelent because there wasn't any limit of hours. I hope that you organice this festival for all the following years. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Alice, How are you? I'm pleased to hear from you. As you already know I go to an English school, Bear House, in Spain. The rules in my country are standart, I mean, the rules are very similar to other countries in Europe. At school you aren't allowed to bring  connected movil phones although there are more than one student that does it. Teachers will take it from you if it rangs during school hours. As well you aren't allowed to bring drugs or arms, to smoke or to drink alcohol inside the school. You have to respect other peoples opinion, teachers, school's material and people who works in the school. If you broke one of these rules you could be expulsed for a week, a month or for ever. At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful with my parent's time table. I can go out at night once a week if I tell them were I'm going to be. In case I lie  them or don't explain my plans that my friends and I have I want be able to go out. As well have the responsability  to look after my brother in case they aren't at home. Answering to you question I won't change nothing because I think that these are the minimum rules that a theenager have to have to be responsable in a future. love ",29.00
325," 10 June 2000 Dear Manager, I would like to complain about your theatre and the musical show that I saw last week. I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about 'Over the rainbow' in the hotel which I stayed . I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited. However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time. I was really disappointed about it. Secondly,  starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes. It was so long time to wait in the theatre. Thirdly, it mentioned about discounts. Despite of the fact that I am a student, I could not get any discounts. I also visited your restaurant after the show but   already closed because the show finished late. Because of the reason above, I, indeed, spent  awful last night in London. I would like you to refund, otherwise, I will take an action. I look forward to receiving  reply to my enquiry. Sincerely  [SEP]  Fashion of the future People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years later from now. If  weather is hot then we don't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies. There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes like layer and layer. For example, T-shirts for women are included  bra: easy to take it out when you wash it,   is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it. Simplest is the best in summer! When it's very cold  winter, we just wear light clothes what we want, in our style. Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we don't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies. We can show our body line in winter as well. Most important thing is that we don't have to kill the animals only for people's cruel aims. Functions' clothes are the way to love animals! ",29.0
183," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to tell  that I saw your musical show ,,Over the rainbow"" and there were too many disappointing divergences between the advertisement for the show and the show itself. The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show. However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement. Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although, it had to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening,  I think you should know that ticket were sold without any discounts. It seems to me that all these failures were your falt, because you were responsible for the arrangement of the show. I think you ought to have postponed the show and have reimbursed me  a ticket price. However, conserning that I saw the show, I would like to get a half refund. Please reply at your earliest convinience. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology changed my daily life completely. When I saw modern technology I mean  Internet. For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend after some hours since he has written it. My friend lives in Kresnodar. My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar. And it takes 3 days to her letter to get to Kursk. That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses  post service. So with  Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time. Another change in my life is that I use  Internet as a library when I write my course papers. So that I can get books which  is impossible to get in  libraries of my town. That is why I think that modern techology helps me in my daily life. ",30.0
543," Dear Helen, I would like to thank you for the letter I have just received. First of all I would like to point out that it is a great pleasure for me to take part in your competition. I would like to assure you that I would do my best to be the one of the winners in your competition. Now, If I would like to state some of the information that you may need. Firstly, I have to say that I can travel only in July this year. This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months. Secoundly, I would be very grateful if you can accommodate me in tents rather than long cabins. It is mostly because I like fresh air at night. From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have choosen: basketball and swimming. I am very good at those kinds of sports and think that I could be the winner. Finally, I would like to ask you how many clothes and how much money should I take with me. I will wait to hearing from you, soon. Yours sincerely, Piotr Kaczmarski  [SEP]  I do agree with the opinion that shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays many young people like to do their shopping. But, isn't it a kind of entertaintment? In the first place, I would like to point out that to go shopping does not always mean to buy something. A lot of people, especially women, go to do their shopping only for fan. In such a situation they are looking for something that they might buy. But, what about real shopping. I mean shopping with a real purpose. For example, emagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate suit. It's a real nightmare when you try to match everything: from the size, the colour to the sawings of the suit that is acceptable for everyone. On the other hand it is a great achievement for you when you buy the suit that is perfect for everyone. To sum up, I would like to say that shopping is enjoyable when you are going only for fan. But, when you want to buy something special it's a real nightmare. ",23.0
431," Mr. Manager: I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time. Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight I had waitted for fourthey five minutes. Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show. It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too. Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered. And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give  it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I couldn't get my money back.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat. She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good. She said that she wouldn't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute ever second. But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad. I just knew I couldn't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for  meal I was in a schock thinking why isn't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat  for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry. I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and  can't keep any secrets. ",22.0

It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country. Now my dream will come true. I will try to give you some information about me. The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then I can have holidays. I would be pleased if it is possible. About accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in the tent and I would like to try it. It will be very interesting for me because normaly I have not a lot of time to do activities. I would prefer swimming because I very like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time, and painting because I have finished  painting course and I have some practice with this. That is very nice that every costs are paited for but I would like to ask you how much money I should to take with me because I do not now anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please to tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activite.

917," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan Yesterday, I received your letter. It made me happy and I would like to than you for the opportunity you offer me First of all I would like to travel in July. I think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to California. This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. About the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen is swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough t this sector. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm intrested in this sport even if I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action. As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the cloths I must take with . Please drop me a line Yours sincierly  [SEP]  Dear Kim Yesterday I received your letter and it made me happy that you and your family are healthy. As you asked me I will write  you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough. Before the concert I helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert. It was really a very beautiful experience. It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too. In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and have a lot of autogrammes by them. I will never forget these days and for sure I will take part in activities like this in the future.

1216," Dear Mrs Smith, I have received your letter dated on the 12th  june 2001. I am very happy to help you and I hope that the informations, that I am going to give you, will be enough. The international student conference will be in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne. The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place ""St-François"". And the name of the street is ""Grand-Chêne"". You can not miss it. After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead  to stay in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us. Afterwards, a live band are going to play  the rest of the night. For the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic. If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free, the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy. There, you can enjoy the Landscape and have a sunbath. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM The aim of this report is to give  further informations on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne. It is based on my own experience. WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM. The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer, for the tourist, an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake. But also, the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues. Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is the olympic history. You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects. In addition, you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games. REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION. The principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum. CONCLUSION. To sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group. Therefore, if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games, it must be the best place for this. ",31.00
703," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter. First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. It is very important for me, because I  always wanted to travel to the U.S.A. I would be able to travel only in July because it is the only month when I don't have to go to school. I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent, it would be a new experience for me. The two activities that I choose are: basketball and climbing. I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old. By the other side, I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it. I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take. I look forward to knowing the date of the camp. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it. As you know, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it. First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs. When the concert was finished, some friends and I went for a drink. It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert.

172," Dear Mr Jones, I'm writting this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle theatre. Firstly In the advertisement you said that the actor would be Danny Brook but there was a different actor in the show and I was really disappointed, because I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook which I personally admire. Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were being told but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed because of renovation. Finally there were no discounts available in the tickets. All the above made my night terribly disappointing and I must say that the advertisement is nothing but a business fraud, so I'm in the unpleasant position  to ask  my money back. I'm looking forward to your reply Yours sincerely Mrs Lemmings.  [SEP]  Technology is an essential part in people's life. It's something absoletuly necessary for every action people does It effects us both positive and negative. It's a part of our lifes. Firstly technology has created a bond between myself and my computer. I got used to spending 2-3 hours in front of the computer. My relationship with my family and friends doesn't even exist. I've end up being a T.V addict Also the need of doing simple things as a family is no longer the case. Why going to the countryside if you can sit there with a bowl of popcorns and watch T.V. Despite the negative effects, technology can effect with a positive way a person's life. Air conditions, watches, computers, and many other things have made my life easier. There's no need on going to the shops when I can order things by the computer. Air conditions also makes my life easier In addition technology has made my life easier but it's also an intrude in my life crating a distance between myself and my family. In my opinion technology is the least thing I could use in my life. ",30.0
739," Dear Helen Ryan, First of all I would like to apreciate  for your generous award. I was dreaming of a holiday for such a long time. Now I have the opurtuanity so I shall inform you fully. I would like to travel in July because, I will be working for the rest of the summer. I would like to stay in a log cabin, since I can't sleep in tiny, narrow areas. I have been sailing in the Mediterennean for eight years and I have been playing tennis for four years so I would like to choose sailing and tennis  activities. I would like to ask you  the sort of the clothes I am supposed bring. I know that I will need sports equipment such as; tennis shoes, a few sport shirts and shorts. Also deck shoes and a waterproof jacket for sailing; but besides that will I need any thing else? What's my fund limit? I would really appreciate  if you could write me back. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I received your letter. I do not want to keep you curious any longer. The oppurnity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance. I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert. I, ofcourse jumped into it. The idea of meeting a worldwide known pop singer; just made my heart punch my ribcage. The concert  was all ready filled up with thousands  , although it was really early. We, the volunteers first unravelled the cables,  set  the microphones and some instruments. Then we, were told go to the back stage and make sure everything was perfect. After a fantastic concert I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears. She is a very nice person I managed to scavange an authograph for you as well I will put it in the envelope. Waiting to hear from you Take here! Melina ",33.0
934," 13.06.00 Dear Mrs Ryan,  I would like to thank you for  first prize. I am really surprised that I have won. I have not expect it. I would like to send you some futher information which you need. I can only come in July because I am working in the office and I cannot take two weeks off in  other month. I am greatful that I have the chance to choose an accomodation. I would rather stay in a tent if its not  problem for you. I would like to experience a reall camp again. I used to be a scout. I need relax after  year in the office thats why I choose photography and painting which are not very active. I am  very shy person and I would prefer to stay in a small group of people, if its possible. I have to questions. I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I should take and I would like to know your opinion  how much money I should take. I would like to thank you onc again for this great opportiunity. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Apolonia Gorski  [SEP]  We would like to belive that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life. After working all week, finally on Saturday we can do shopping. We love spending money, but spending money is not always enjoyable. Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go confortable because of  crowd. Why its always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundrets other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods. ",29.0
301," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to you to complain about the musical show, wich everything was completely different from the advertisement. Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains I can start with the actor -  was a different one , not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous, but him I think he is a ""street actor"" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that drove me mad. I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for  discount ticket, I could not get it, it was really unfair, I paid  normal price. Also there was another problem, I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not,  was closed because it has been refurbished and redecorated. Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out however I had just a terrible time, everything went wrong. The only thing to do is: to compensate me, send  my money back, I am sending my ticket for that: Hope you'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully Márcia  [SEP]  ""Techno life"" Twenty first century - technology, technology, and technology. Modern life it has been full of science and tecnologies. I am very pleased that I  born under such good tecnologies like my parents didn't have the same luck. My life is much easier with all these stuffs above mentioned - tecnology and science. Computers have changed people's life, many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices.  Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny. There is  ambiguity about technology -  can bring good things and terrible things as well. One good side is  making life easier - computer, mobile phones, vending machines, etc.... The bad side is   to use tecnology for war - missiles, weapons, etc.... Indeed tecnology has changed our lives, we have become more scepitical and cold. I believe that people should take just good advantages that. Sometimes I think tecnology is not a good thing....

1026," Dear Mr Robertson. I'm writing  you about our journey which you have already orginesed. First of all, thank you for your good programme. We saw your details and enjoyed  them. Especially  River trip to Greenwich and visiting  National Art Gallery. All the students in my class are excited about one more thing. We saw an advertisement about  Fashion And Leisure Show. It will be at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is Tuesday March 14. The show can be seen between 10.00 - 19.00. This show is about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles. One more thing about  show is,  it's free for students. Isn't it a big opportunity for us? As you know, there is a free time in your programme if you don't mind, we can go for shopping in this free time. This changing, give us an opportunity to go to  show on Tuesday afternoon. We hope you an accept our suggestion. It will make us so happy. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerally,  [SEP]  A PRIVATE LIFE All people have some difficulties about their job but some of them have more than the others. Reason for this;  they are famous and everybody wants to learn about them. Having a private life is important for everybody. I think, people want this. if you are a famous person, for example  singer, film star, politician or well-know footballer, you haven't get any choice. Because people want to learn about you everything. so journalists are following you all the time. I know, they are not like us. They are famous, but I think they need to be alone sometimes. They nead to be with their family in silence. This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them, too. I think  media must be more understanding. We don't have to learn  their every second. We have to remember that, they need a private life like us. We can love them without disturbing  too. ",33.00

[SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Now let's start whith shopping at  Beverley Center.  Beverley Center area is the place that the teenager like to go shopping  the most. But some teenager like to go to Bolton-Market. Because every one have different thinking like beverley center if you  there every day or every week for a shopping you well get very boring because some time  is to much people every where like in the resturant and shops. It's make you feel  want to go home. And about the traffic some times it makes you feel  don't want to go out because of the traffic. And if you never know money or you have less money shopping is not enjoyable for you I'am choue. And shopping in the market is one think that I' am not going to do. Because all the smell in the market is alfrell   is the smell of the meat and durty water black and smely water all over the market street. I think of it it's make my shopping enjoyable.

422," Dear Sir or Madam, Ref: Over the rainbow musical show. I am writing to you to mention some problems about the musical show shown in your theatre. First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show, it wasn't. Because I'm big fan of them, if was pretty much boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing. It didn't start at 19:30 and there was a delay for 45 minutes which was quite a long time and everyone got frustrated. The tickets also caused a problem. Discounts weren't available at all. Moreover the testament was till under the construction so that we couldn't use it when we were extlemely hungry. Finally, I wonder why you didn't ask for the money back if you have guaranteed the perfect evening. I am therefore writing to you to ask for the money back as I didn't get any advantages or services from you. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, L. P. Lou  [SEP]  Technology has been developed extremely fast these days and as it is still going on, it can't help affecting our lives. One of the biggist thing  has changed is a change in a method of communications. People have invented such things like TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us enable to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily. There are also changes in biological areas. Nearly almost of the disease have been found the way to cure except only a few like AIDS. It helped us to live longer and make us stronger against them. I have mentioned  few changes above but there's still a biggist one left which is about computer areas. It helped us to be able to work much more quicker and accurately than before with the help of  Internet. Basically modern technology has changed our life more comfortably but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship, togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for  whole day. But we still have to admit that we can't live without them even  they give us some disadvantages. ",24.0
85," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writting to you because I've been in the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts. As well, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful to you for the next festival. Firstly, I want to congratulate you for the idea, I think that it's very important the development of the arts and that everybody could assist without paying too much. Having a ticket for all the events is a great method because it's an organised way of paying and you win time. On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable to apreciate the event. Other thing, is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't cheat the people by saying that they are from all  the world. In my opinion, you should call more artist from other countries and have some concert halls bigger or may be change the distribution. Well, I think that everything is told but could you tell me, if it's possible, if there will be more plays and films next year? I'm waiting for your answer.  Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, Thanks for your letter, it was nice to hear from you again. I've recently started the classes so all the rules were given to us, like you know,  the first day. As you want me to tell you how about the rules are here, I'll start. Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat . You must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that rules. My mum only doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but  telling her previously. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says. So, I'm free when I'm out of the school. I'd like it would be nicer going there. Lots of love, ",26.00
978," Dear Misses RYAN I am writing to inquire whether there is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences about travel. Indeed I would rather to travel only on July since I'm going to work in august in order to earn money to pay  my studies next year. Moreover I would prefer being accommodate in  log cabins because I can't put up with mosquitos and other insects which risk coming into tents. Besides I've chosen two activities from the list: Tennis as I practice this sport regularly and I'm very good in this activity and Golf because I ignore all about this sport and I wish I will discover it thanks to you. On the other hand, I would obtain some details about the kind of clothes that I should carry with me and how much money to take You don't hesitate to contact me in order to have further information. I hope quickly hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear readers As you have already know, your English class is going to make a short video about daily life at your school, that's why I'm writing a report suggesting which, lessons and other activities, should be filmed. First of all, he seems obvious that we should, at least once, film a lesson with our English teacher who have had the idea to make this short video. Besides I would suggest filming a lunch to the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noises inside the restaurant because of  babbles. At the end, to my opinion, It would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body's abilities, and not only our brain's abilities at school.

780," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you a lot for your letter, I am very happy of having won the competition. I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp. First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to . I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin. I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography, I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before. Finally, I would like to know what sort of clothes do  advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid , do I need to take a lot of money with me? Thank you a lot for all these details. Yours sincerely Jasmine Martin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have a lot of different things to tell you about what happened at the concert. It was really an amazing experience. First, I had to spend all  the day before the concert in the field where it took place, I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments. I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood. I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage. As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group. That was the best. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, Brenda ",34.0
550," Dear Helen Ryan, I'm really happy to know that I won in your competition. And first of all, before  to ask for informations about the travel, I want to tell you thanks a lot. I would like to travel in July because  is the best period to take a break from my work. For the accomodation, if is possible I would like to stay in  camping because I think  is a relaxing place where to stay. Further because I like to live in contact with the nature. Also  is possible to meet a lot of people, and chatting during the night, might around the fire, playing a clutone and singing I think  is a nice way to have fun. I'm really happy to know that  is possible to play sports. I would like to play Tennis, and  swimming. I choose tennis because  is a sport that you can play with others people, also because I like the competition in the sport. The other sport that I would like to do is swimming. Swimming is my favourite sport because you can relax your body and your mind. I would like to ask you for further informations about this travel. First of all which kind of clothes  I have to bring with me? How much money  I need to do this travel? Also, if is possible I want to know if there is the possibility  to organise a trip around the most important cities near the camp? And if during the nights there are  entrotenements? Thanks for all these informations, I'm looking forward to hearing  you again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  After the discussion that we had in the english class, I understood that a lot of people sometimes don't enjoy during the shopping. I can't understand these people because this situation never happen to me. By the way usually the people that don't like shopping are men or children. I think  is difficult to find a woman that doesn't like shopping. But I have to admit that sometimes I don't really like shopping above all when I'm tired or when I'm not in the right mood. In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become nervous because I can't find anything. For me, the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations. For the first situation happen to me, when I'm hungry with somebody really close to me like my boyfriend or a component of my family, so for relaxing my mind I go to shopping and usually I enjoy  a lot. The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something for me as a preseant for myself. ",27.0
829," Dear Helen Ryan. My name is Agripina T. I just recive your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions. I would like to travel only on July because it's the only month when I'm free. On June I have to take some English lessons. I would prefer to live in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents. I don't really like living in tents. If it's possible to live in log cabins I'll be pleased. While I'm at the Camp, I would like to do two  favorite activities which are basketball and singing. I love to play basketball. I'm not good at it but I try my best. Before I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded  a lot. Also I like singing. In future I would like to be a singer. I like this kind of activity. There is something else I would like to ask. At the Camp, is there a free uniform or we will have to wear something spessial? Also I would like to ask about money. How much money should I take with me? And is it nesessary to bring money, will we need them? This is all what I wanted to ask. Thank you for everything. Yours sincerely  Agripina Tymoshenko.  [SEP]  I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons. From  activities I suggest to film sport lessons. and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always work, but us we work,  joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial. It's not true. We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math because they think that it's  boreing subject. I think it's all depends of  teacher. Our Math. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math. For activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new. We do many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are speccial. We try to play on many instruments,  sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that. Report by Agripina Tymoshenko. ",26.0
736," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am so glad. I have won first prize in your competition! It was a really big surprise for me. I will join The Camp California in the U.S.A. with pleasure. I would like to travel there in July, because only in July I can have holiday. In June and in August I will have to work, so it would be rather impossible for me to join Camp California then. I would like to have an accomodation in  log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent. So if I could choose I would like to stay in a log cabin. Being at the Camp I would like to swim and to play tennis. I have swam for 10 years and I have played tennis since I was 9 years old and those activities I like best. I thin I am the best in horse riding; I even have my own horse, so if it is possible I would like to ride horses at Camp California. I am looking forward for hearing from you. Yours sincerely Felicia Zajac  [SEP]  It was a bright, shinny day. I woke up early in the morning and I decided to go shopping. Warsaw's ,, Clif'' is my favourite shopping centre so I went there. I saw a beautiful, long dress. I decided to try it on. - What is your size - said  shop-assistant. - 36 - I said. - Och, I am very sorry, but we have run out of 36 size. I was going to the chemist to buy some eye-shadow, when I saw black, suede shoes. Those shoes must be mine! - I thought. I went in and I asked the shop assistant if I could try it on. - Yes, of course- she replied- but what is your size? - 38 - I said. - I'am very sorry but we do not have 38. I was very angry. I had some money, I wanted to spend them, but?! Everything did not suit me! It was enough! I came back home - tired and angry. Surely it was not the best day for shopping. I did not buy anything, although I tried. So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoable. ",27.0
1011," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am a student of the FCE class and I am writing to you in name of my class to thank you for the programme about the three days trip to London that you have prepared for us. We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery. Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March. We would like to go to this show. There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear . In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles. We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion. For these reasons I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday's afternoon. You can give the possibility to the students too choose between go shopping or go to the show. The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be opened until 7. pm. It is even free for students!! I hope that this change will not cause to you too many problems. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I agree with this statement. I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time. A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed. In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far. For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death. On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous. The famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work. In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday. In conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media.

707," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. I was very glad to hear that I had won first prize in the competition. Anyway, to participate in two-weeks  Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information. First of all, the most favorable time for me to travel is July, because I am in the final year of University, so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July, when I can take a relatively long summer holiday. Second of all, I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents, since I have had a horrible experience being attaked by a herd of midges, when I camped out. Additionally, I am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay. I would willingly like to choose swimming and painting. I used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week. I have also gone in for some competitions. Painting is one of my hobbies as well, although I do not specialise in it or anything. I'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of California. Last but not at least, what sort of clothes do you think I must bring with me, and is there any laundry system there? Also should I take some money just in case? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, and I would be very grateful for your help. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department's investigation. Lessons According to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like Maths. Consequently it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of  English department. Extra activities It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed. Conclusion To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life. It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of. ",37.0
1235," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you. You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is  ; once you have gone out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just by our college. When you are in the college ask for me. The conference will take one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start, it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff. The dress code is: no jeans. We will prove you with food and drinks. For your free hours I have quite a few ideas. There are lots of things to do here. We have got a museum which is just at two minutes from your hotel. You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café. If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that. I hope this information will be helpful. If you have any other questions, please, do contact me. Looking forward to seeing you soon. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  THE MOBILE PHONE The mobile phone has completely changed our lives, it is an instrument which I cannot imagine myself living without. Apart from being in-fashion it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it? Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone. I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone. Five years ago you wouldn't have even thought about it. It has been a plus for me. For example, now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me, and, sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with. All over, the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone. ",38.00
659," Dear Madame, I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know  to have won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, call the information you need to complete the partecipation procedure. I would like to travel only on July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at the Cornell University: this school is closed on July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the  accomodation I prefer is in tent. there are two main reasons for the choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the relative activities: building-up the tent, cooking on camp and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the camp daily life (the tent, the sleep bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like the water sport and I am a quite good guitar  singer - Some questions: What about the average temperature at the camp on July? What are the better clothes to use at the camp? How much money may be useful at the camp? I will be very glad to partecipate to your camp! Yours faightfully Steve Galliano  [SEP]  Our school, as it is well known, is a technical school and consequently the daily life contains different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, showed to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create the video. The mathematical lessons are divided in two part: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will be surely enclosed in the video. Moreover, many sport activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on. Some parts of the final video may describe these additional features of the school. ",32.0
1007," Dear John! I was very happy to receive your letter. I haven't heard from you for a long time, how are you? How is your sister, Marine? I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and acknowledgeable. We were also very lucky with the weather, it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long. I think you should definetly go and I'll try to help in what I can. First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions. I think you should take  packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle). I advise you to try  watersports as well, it's a real laugh. I'm not sure how many students are there in your class but they give reductions for groups  over 15 people so maybe you'll have to invite some friends to join you. By the way, I'd love to come with you, if it's possible! I really enjoyed our trip and I'm eager to see you again! Looking forward to your reply, Love  [SEP]  TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day, unable to press the ""Off"" button on the remote control. Some say it's evil, it spoils our eyes and personality, others say it's useful, enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality. But can each one of these people answer one simple question! ""Could you live without television for a week?"" I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived  three weeks in a complete TV vacuum, I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings. You might ask me a normal question ""What about  news?"" Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers? And the radio (if you're too lazy to read the news yourself and prefer them to be read to you!) The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say ""no"" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more. ",40.00
1193," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday. I do welcome you and your group, and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me . Firstly, let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference. The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there  many ways to get to the conference. The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes. The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening. Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech, and after that dinner will be served. The party is not very formal, so you can wear any kind of dress, as long as it is suitable for dinner. Finally, I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day's free time. It must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere. It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing. I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information. I look forward to seeing you soon, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  . Report on Kyoung Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom. . Introduction . This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace, which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries. It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples, and makes a final recommendation. . History . The kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of  20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size. As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army. . Activity . The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tends to dislike the historical visit, would be the various activity. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace. . Final Recommendation . It is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history. You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea. ",37.00
530," June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing this letter to show whom disappointed am I with the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"". First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared. When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but  started at a quarter past eight. Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for  discount but they weren't available. When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed. So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born. When I wake up I take a shower using eletricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus, when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave than I watch t.v. and do my homework using a pen, when I come back from jiu-jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed. About a millenium ago every thing was different the people didn't have electricity, they did their food on the fire and they didn't have pens. Comparing these too realities the reader can notice that modern technology changed very much our daily life. ",27.0
331," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week. It didn't go on as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished. Firstly, it was  to start at 19:30 a I bought my ticket for the evening session. However, it began at 20:15. I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long. Second, instead of being starred by Danny Brook, the musical was starred by another actor, who I found really disappointing. Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show. I asked for the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them. In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday. I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day of main audience . Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement said and that we all wished turned out to be a regret for the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money. I'm looking forward to receiving your decision. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life has changed quite a lot with modern technology. I live more comfortably and  even more carefree than some years ago. I've been able to improve some things that could have annoyed me some time ago, and although they're mainly little changes they make me notice that my life is easier. At home, for example, my waking up is no more a surrounding sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program, set to start at seven o'clock. Then, when I was younger I would have to put the milk on the fire and wait until it was warm enough to drink. Nowadays, almost everybody have a microwaves oven, where you put your milk  less than two minuts and it is ready to delight your mouth. Another thing are the fifty-two steps which take me to the street. They have become as easy as calling the lift, without  feeling tired or even breathless, when I was in a hurry. Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out until later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of  Internet and its arriving to a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want. In brief, my life is taking the most out of the discoveries in science and technology and it can't be hidden that I'm really glad of that. ",33.0
743," Dear Sir/Madame, I'm writeng with reference to your letter. I've being very thrilled, when I've known, that I won first prize in your competition. I always dreamed about going to the California and now my dreams are coming truth. If it's possible, I would like to travel only  July, because my school won't be finished earlier. I couldn't go  August, either, because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends. If I had a choice, I would prefer to live in  tent then in a log cabin. I can't imagine real holidays without a tent. It's one of the most important things for me, to have a chance to forget about all my present, luxurious life and try doing something different. I would be very grateful, if you gave me a possibility of singing. I've always wanted to learn singing professionaly, but I've never had an occasion. I'm very keen on swimming, too. Normally, I live in the seaside and I couldn't live without this sport. Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters. distance. I would like to ask you what clothes should I take with me? My mother told me, that when she had been there two years ago it was really hot. Should I take with me a lot of money? You know, I'm only a student. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely Halina Lipnicka  [SEP]  Hallo, Kim! Thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't rewritten sooner, but I was very busy. I must tell you that helping at pop concerts is very exciting, but very tiring too, so I had to rest. You asked me about my experiences. Well, it was the best time of my life! I worked all days, but I did it with pleasure. We lived here in rush, but there was a lot of fun, too. I was very surprised, when I saw that singers aren't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers. One day I was talking to Stenkovska, because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone, so I should ask her what did she want. When she tried to answear me, one small child made her a picture with  flesh. Imagine, she weren't angry! She said he should do it again, because she had stupid features! If I were she, I would kill that boy, but she was nice! Trully, my work here wasn't very important, but I relly enjoyed it. I've met here so many new people! Sometimes somebody should on me, but I have to say they are often right. Well, I made  couple  mistakes. The hardest was, when I brought a pepperoni pizza for kubulska, but she doesn't eat meat! But, for luck, it wasn't achieved with succes of our concert. You have to admit, that the show was magnificent. I hope you had a great fun when you was watching us at the TV set, didn't you? O.K. That's all for today. I'll write  you again tomorrow, because now my Mom is angry, the I'am not sleeping yet. Write soon! I can't hardly wait. Give my best to your parents. Hugs and kisses Halina.

729," 13th June 2000 Dear Ms Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I have just recieved the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize. I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am. I am therefore writing to give you my further information. First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. Because I intend to take  examination in Septenber. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried. The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it. And nowadays, I have been practicing tennis as  school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis. Finally, I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need. I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe  but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was. All  work I needed to do wasn't very interesting. which I must have set thousands  chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of  stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as  audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sit down there. Additionally, you couldn't believe , but the vocalist said ""All the chairs you are sitting down  were set  from him,"" pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory. Anyway it was so interesting  time that I didn't even feel tired after that. Finally, I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity. You must like it. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Can you send me the letter back writing what happend to you recently. Bye! Love, ",27.0
1020," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you as a representative of the class about the 3-day school trip which has been organized for next week. First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organization of this trip which seems to be very interesting and useful for the students. Especially I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us. All the students are enthusiastic about it. However, some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March. The Exhibition will show all the latest fashion in a very wide range from sports wear to make up and even hairstyles. What is more, the show is free for all the students. We feel that taking part to it would be a great opportunity to us since we will be able to have some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our days. Under the circumstances, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition. It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm, so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon. I hope you will consider this possibility and tell us as soon as possible if you intend to accept our proposal. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes. But not always famous people are happy of their condition. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: ""I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do"" There is no surprise to this answer: famous people can not have their own private life. Whenever they go out they are suddenly ""hounded"" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph. But the worst thing of all is that they are often  victim of malicious gossips, which most of the times are not even true. In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings, on the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed: not always, in fact, money and celebrity being happiness. ",34.00
576," 14.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very glad I won the competition. This trip will, undoubtedly be a wonderful experience. As far as the dates of travelling are concerned, the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the remaining  summer. I really didn't expect to win the trip. I would therefore be very thankful if you could book the tickets for then. Concerning the accommodation choice you have proposed me, please make sure I am sleeping in a tent, as I have never experienced open air camping before. I think it would be nice to try it at least once. Concerning the proposed activities please, accept me for Singing and Painting. The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad. Concerning Singing activities, I think I'm quite good as I have been in my school's choir for 3 years. Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  17 October 2000 Dear Kim, As you asked me, I write  you about my experience at the Pop Concert. Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big stress about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people. There were 963 persons in the ""Armaggedon"" that night! But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other way to meet the ""New Bentley"" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one  I shared a meal with Paul McPartney. I'm sure you are jalous now. Don't worry they still organise these ""youth work"" programs. With love John ",32.0
1102," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you concerning the London trip that my English class is going to do in March. First of all I want to thank you for the good programme that you mack for my class in such a short time. The students are especially very happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to do on tuesday morning of 14th March. The point of my letter is that  students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and they would appreciate  if they could go and see the show. The show is going to include  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles and best of all it is free for students to get in. The only problem is that the show is going to take place on tuesday of 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes in your programme. My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be showed. We suggest to swop shopping on tuesday and free time on Wednesday, so we can see the show on tuesday afternoon. I'll hope that this matter doesn't going to cause you any problems and we hope for an answer as soon as possible. Thank you  [SEP]  The home of the Futere In what ways do you think people's homes will be different in the future? That is the question, which many people ask themselves and other people quite often. The technologi is changing very fast and at the same moment as I'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new owen which co-operate with your refrigerator and has in the programme to make dinner for you every day without that you have to do anything. What about rooms which can feel your mood and acting after that, if you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing musik on and turn down the light a little bit. Next step might be a robot, which would do all your housework, but what would happened to the people? I think that everyone should not think just about the positive sides with technologi but also the negative. The technologi is good as long as it gives people more free time, but what would happened if freetime became your life? ",28.00
1059," Dear Mr Robertson I would like to congratulate you for the excellent programme that you have prepared. I think that  is such a good programme especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting. However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London  where the latest fashions will be shown. There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles, too. And it has free-entrance for the students. We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London,  the 14th of March. We think that, if you don't have any problem, we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show. We are wating for your decision and we will accept it whatever it  be. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  ""THE HOME OF THE FUTURE"" From any point of view, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just  pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa. Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very important, they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier. The cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. In balance then, I think that the houses that we can see on films won't really exist. ",33.00
554," Dear Helen I am writing to thank you for the first prize in your competition and reply to your letter. First of all, according to your letter you asked me my prefered travel dates. If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to go on my holiday in July. On your letter, you are going to provid me one of tents and log cabins with accommodation at Camp California. I would like to be in tents because I can find it being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins. I am very happy because I can have a chance to do activities while I am at the camp. I would like to take part in the Golf and the sailing. I am not goot at both of them. I have been interested in them so I would like to turn up them on this chance. Finally, I would like to know something about travel. Could you let me know whether I need extra money or what sort of clothes I need. I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be the first time in the U.S.A. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I was happy to get your letter. I haven't writen a letter to you for ages. I'm sorry about that. On your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert. I'll tell you my experience about helping  the pop concert. At first, I applyed for the volenteer at the pop concert and then I got a responsibility for control the audience. I had to make the fan to keep  a queue. I also make them find their seats. It was very hard working. For example, I always spoke loudly and run fast. However, there was something good to me. I saw a lot of singers and entertainers. I didn't need to pay  enterence fee because I was working there. Plus, I got a authography from a popular singer. I'll give you the authography for  present. It is valuable of keeping on your suvinier. I'll tell you more  experience on  next letter. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best whishes ",20.0
797," Dear Sir, I am writing to you in reply to your letter. First of all I want to give you the thanks for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been in the USA, so I think that this travel will be an unforgetable experience. Secondly, I will like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school. In August I have to be in Madrid because I am going to work as a trainee in a travel agency. After august I must return to school, so I can only go to California in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the nature and camping, so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin. Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good in swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good in tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and which kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know the money that I have to take and which amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look foward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely, Silvia Torroja.  [SEP]  In my opinion the statement 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' is totally true. An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like. Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue  trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example. I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments you don't know what to say. In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping is boring I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment. So, shopping is not enjoyable, but necessary. ",37.0
1243," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college. However, due to the congestions and delay near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is by  underground,  Victoria Street station. You would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes. At the end-of-conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities. All different types of clothing could be worn however jean wears and T-shirts would be common on that day. Instead  staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre. The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium,  market square, could be found near our monument of our town, the Saltisy Bridge. I am looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Little Woods shopping mall Location The Little Woods shopping mall is an idea place for you and your group to visit. It is located very close to the town centre next to the town museum. It can be accessed by the nearby train station. Facilities For those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewellery, stationary, book shops, fashion and beauty departments and many more are availiable. For those who want something more exciting and advanturous, you are recommanded to visit the Fun Fair and amusement  on the top floor of the building. Other facilities such as cinemas, theatres,  large department stores could also be found . There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from aboard  to enter the car park. Conclusion Not only the tourist information centre would provide the information you might need, you could also visit the ICT block which allows you to access onto anything you want to know from the computers. A special trip could also be organized. ",30.00
1054," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to thank you for the lovely programme you organised for our trip to London, especially because we will have both cultural trips and entertainments, like shopping. I can tell you that we are all looking forward to going there. However, I have been asked by the class to propose  you another visit. We all would like to go and see the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday 14th March, from 10.00 to 19.00, in the London's Central exhibition Hall. This show is about the latest fashions, the leisure and sports wear, the make-up and the hairstyles. Everybody in the class is interested in this show, and it would be a great opportunity for us to see it, especially because many of us would like to work later in the fashion . Moreover, this show won't cost anything because it is free for the students! Consequently, I proposed  to change the programme as follows; on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping, we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, during our free time. What do you think about that? Hoping to hear from your decision soon. Yours sincerely, (class 3CD)  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time."" Nowadays, most people think that famous people have a so good life ( lots of money, comfortable house ) that they have to stop complaining about he media's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life. On  one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the audiance, and soon. Moreover, especially for film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the Tv or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their fame. However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographs all the time. You can't go outside quietly, and there is all the time a crownd of people who stands in front of your house waiting for you. The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have all the time people around your house who are watching at you or people who are following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this. That is why I think that famous people deserve a private life, like everybody , and that journalists should not follow them everywhere. ",33.00

Without any doubt,   a hystorical place which provides it's visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of the greek history  during the passing of  centuries. Don't miss the chance to visit the hystorical museum, located in the heart of the capital city. A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century. The hystorical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what  greek have always considered as  main principal: their freedom. There are five diffrent floors, each of them presents a diffrent chronical period of greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding to the revolution of 1967.

I would like to join the camp in July because I could get  holiday from my company from 1th July to 28th July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in tents. In my experience, I've never tried to stay in tents during the holiday. That's why I'd like to feel adventurally. It could be  good memorable thing for me. And I am interested in swimming and singing. When I was 17 years old, I could be able to won  swimming competition which is held in  local stadium. I had won second prize.

515," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing  you to show my disagree about the musical show 'Over the rainbow. First, I am very dissapointed with the starring. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike. Also, the musical did not start at 19.30, it started forty-five minutes later. That is why,  it finished later and I arrived late to a basketball match. Another thing is that there were not any discounts in the entrance fee. Finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because it was sunday. It is closed all sundays, you have to say it. That is why I will be pleased if you give  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why I didn't want to tell him that I had failed my natural science final exam. I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed, before we were on holidays, they will cancelled the trip to Africa. But, I need to say it to someone, so I told it to Pat. The next day, all the class knew  it. I wasn't too worried because if someones is going to see my parents, I would tell them before not talk about the exams. But, when my mother was talking with Pat's mother and she mentioned it,  my mother cancelled the trip to Africa. It wasn't Pat fault, it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and also, I knew that Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",26.0
287," Dear Sir/Madam, I saw the musical show in your advertisment in my holiday. I was disappointed with it. I would ask you to my money back. First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but actually, starting was not Danny Brook but another person. Besides her acting didn't make me satisfied. Secondly,  starting time was not 19:30 but 20:15. Because of it, I was waited for a long time, Also, there was no system that ticket can be discounted. Finally, I went to  restaurant in your theatre but it was closed, I couldn't eat anything. That's  nub of my complaints. Thus I spent  terrible time - it was  waste of time. I'm expecting for your reply soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  'Fashion of the future, I think after 100 years, at least something will change in the point that design, material, color, etc. If I pick up the example,  Kimono (Japanese traditional cloth) will wear on not only Japan but also  another countries in generally. Also it will be only wear but its design, shape might take in casual cloth. If it came true, imagination to make cloth would bigger and could think various design and format. By one country's traditional cloth taking in those of another country, it can born different type and new kind of fashion. On the other hand, there might vanish  personality (character) of each country. However, thinking way that simple is the best will not change. Also, comfortable cloth for person will maintain in the future. I guess the good things will not change forever. ",16.0
356," 17th Juni 2000 The manager of the Circle Theatre Dear Sir, I'm in London  first time and I wondered what is interesting on yours stage: I read in  newspaper the advertisment about  best musical show. In  advertisment  starring was very interested - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I desided to go to your theatre but at the beginning  was the tranbles. In  advertisment  was - ""discounts available"". I'm  teacher and in Polan I have discounts but in England no, I know this is other country. I was disappointed because you wrote about it! Otherwise, the musical show started too late at 20 15 not 17 30! This was a waste of time. I was very suppresed when I saw  different actor, it wasn't Danny Brook. This musical show wasn't ""the best"". I went out earlier but the theatre restaurant was closed. I had  very disappointing evening. I would ask you for  money back. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  ""Fashion of the Future"" What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This is  very interesting question for us and maybe very important too. We think and speak about it in our families. I saw one week ago on TV (the 23th annual) the fashion show in Paris and I was very surrprised because of this style. All  models had a very strange long shoes made from black skin, the trouses was quite short and the jackets was elegant with blazzend materiell. I think the fashion of the future will be very different but suitable for all people. The people will wear clothes  from natural materials like silk,  comfortable and elgant. The colours will be  very good quality and the fashion will be changed very quickly like now. Because the world is now a global village the people will wear at least one part of traditional or national clothes (for example  peasnt jacket or hat) like  now in rural areas from time to time.

267," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000. Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I'd not go there because everythings went wrong. I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for student like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day it delaied about 45 minutes. During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove. There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them. It really disappointed me. After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed. It was a sign in front of the restaurant ""sorry we  closed because special reasons"" and I was wondering what was the reasons for that. Finally I would like to have  refund for my ticket back because it was  horrible evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Paya Chuaswee (Miss)  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets that  why our great plan for  horiday were not be real. It happened in last summer we planed to go on holiday in the Southen part of Thailand by motorbike but we couldn't tell our parents because they wouldn't allow us to go. We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place by 6 o'clock in the evening. The sun was shining and  wind were breezing like we had imaged. Whlile I was standing on the beach suddenly I heard someone called my name and said that I had to go home, that  right, she is my mum. She told me Pat had phoned her while we were going and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to went by bicycle. Eventhrough we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never though about it. From now on I don't want to tell something secrets to Pat because she always tell someone else but she  still my best friend. ",26.0
43," Dear Jane Clark Hello! My name is Yuna Kimber who attended this annual International Arts Festival. I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival to you. First of all, I appreicate you for organizing such an exciting festival.  It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself to this festival so much. By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries. And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt stuffy. I hope you'll get much bigger concerts hall next year. On the other hand,  plays and films were excellent. I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year. Finally, I'd like to mention  reasonably-priced weekend ticket.  It was brillient, because if I had to pay  all things each I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.  Thank you very much about that. I hope it will be helpful and useful for you. Bye for now Faithfully yours  [SEP]  Long time ago, there were two brothers, whose parents were dead.  Their parents were rich, so when they passed away they left a lot of money. By the way, the elder brother, Nolbu was a so greedy man. He didn't want to share the money with his brother, Hungbu so he took all of the money, and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything. Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family. But, even if he was so poor, he was so good and had a lot of affection about the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them. But, Nolbu always made people annoyed, and enjoyed other people's misfortune. One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer county during the winter.  He cured the bird to fly with love, and the bird was able to fly. The following year, when the bird returned  his house, he gave him a message.  It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid. Therefore, Hungbu became much richer than Nolbu, and he lived happily with the money helping the poor. People belive that the bird was sent by heaven. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
1116," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to thank you for the well organised programme you have done. It will be a good opportunity for visiting London and its interesting places like the Science Museum. In addition it is properly to mention you that all the students of my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure show, which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall. The London Fashion and Leisure show is an amaizing show because there are parades with the latest fashions, we could know some famous top models Besides there are a variety of clothes either sport wear as elegant desings. Not only we could see the latest trend in make-up but hairstyles performed by important coiffeurs. With your agreement we could change the programme. Maybe we could go on shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to The Show. We would like to have  reply  to became making the arrangements. Many thanks again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I have never imagined I had to face this situation. I joined with an expedition team in order to explore the Rocky Mountains. We planned a programme. We arrived to the place in the morning and started to walk. Every thing was marvellous, I got on well with all the partners. The landscapes were the most beautiful that I had ever seen before. The weather was delightful, except  this afternoon when  started to rain and we decide to stay during the night inside a hole in the wall of the mountain. I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it, when a rain of stones covered the entrace of the hole. I was terrified, I knew that the only solution was to ask for helping. I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone, I called the police and they ask for a rescue. Thanks to God everything finished in a good way. and my partners were successfully rescued.

706," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to reply  your letter in which you let me know I had won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel in July as it is the only month in this year when I do not have any exams. I am currently attending University and I have exams all term long. For accommodation I would prefer a tent, as I love nature and I like going camping a lot. About the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball. I know very little about surfing, it is almost something new for me. I have only practised it once. But, on the other side, I am a good basketball player, and I practise it three or four times a week as I play in the University team. There are some things I would like to know first of all, the kind of clothes I should take with me. Then, if I need to take any money to the camp. And finally, if you could tell  when would I be leaving and coming back. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? How are you doing at school? I have a terrible cold but I feel OK anyway. I got it two weeks ago in a concert, but although I've been to the doctor, I can't get over it yet! Well, but I don't regret going to that concert. It was wonderful! You know I love designing clothes, and there I had the chance to make a dream come true. A friend of mine was organising a pop concert, and as he knew me well, he asked me if I'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show. Of course, I accepted immediately very pleased. It was a marvellous experience, I really enjoyed working with such a nice team, they were really kind with me. And, as if it wasn't enough,  doing what I love! It's something I will never forget. And tell me, are you planning coming back to visit me? Please let me know if you have some days free so as to organise a little journey together. Well, I think I'd better close now. Write back soon! love, ",31.0
366," Dear Sir/Madam The Circle Theatre manager I am writing to complain about your product. I would like you to back my money because that was not same as your advertisement. I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement. In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time, price discount and equipment. DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actor so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my apointment on that day at 18=30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me. However, when I went to the theatre, you didn't anything not only discount but also apporogize  us for  dalay of starting  musical. In addition  different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner about the musical because the restrant had been closed. It made me so dissapoint and angry. You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He always tried to say nothing and did. But everyone always noticed he had  secrets from his face. Whenever he has  secrets, his nose moves quickly. He had not liked this habit and had thought it was wrost of him until he solved a big crime. When all  money had gone from a bank, nobady  there except Pat. Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him. So. Pat didn't say anything. But his nose moved quickly when  police showed  a picture of  bank robbers. Then  police realized who were bank robbers and arested them. Although  bank robbers complained to Pat, he said nothing to anybody. He just moved his nose!! Thanks to his habit, he is still alive and all  money were backed to the bank. The town became peace again. ",19.0
62," Dear Madam, I'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it ""international"" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (mentioned to be ""from around the world"") were from only six countries. Maybe the eason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones. On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose  impressed me  most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year. I also thank you for the excellent idea of  one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in. My suggestion for next year's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer! Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Friend, Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it. If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them in a nutshell. We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often. At home I don't have many rules either. I must wash the dishes from time to time (I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty) and clean our house. I don't think there is anything I'd like to change. I'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours! Your faithfully, ",37.00
409," Dear Sir or Madam: I'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" that was held in your theatre. It was a very disappointing evening so I ask for my money back. The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full ticket. Another problem was that the show started 45 minutes late and I had a surprise when I saw that the main character was not played by Danny Brook, who is one of my favourite actors. Finally I want to complain about the theatre restaurant. We read that we could visit it after the show but it was closed because the waiters were on strike. I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking  my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Fashion news are followed by lots of people. We want to know what we will have to wear next year but we want to know it now. But have you thought about what kind of clothes we will wear 100 years from now? People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for they daily life. I think that this tendence will not change but what will change is life. We tend to  a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it. Another important thing will be the use of technology. Scientists are looking for new materials that will made our clothes more comfortable  stronger. Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies and modern devices will be included in our daily clothes. Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected with technology and society. ",32.0
1," 16.12.00 Dear Jane Firstly I want to tell you that the idea of the ""International Arts Festival"" was a really great idea. I enjoyed the festival pretty much. However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange little details. I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival. This also would take more attraction to the festival. Another point which I think was ennoying, are the concert halls. The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so much people I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall. The plays and the films were really great. I enjoyed all of them. I hope to see much more films next year. The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it made a really big effect on the attraction,  that of course made the festival much more enjoyable. I again want to say that it was really nice to be at the festival. I believe that next year will be better if you consider my ideas. Your Sinccerly  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Andrew, I just received your letter and decided you to write back now; because of your questions which were about the rules. I'm really tired of the rules in school! Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that I'm going  is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearing has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example if you don't come to school  10 days in a year we fail that year. Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to. This is all that I can tell you about my school and family. Rules are every where and you can't change them. So just don't think about them. Your Best Pen friend ",32.00
602," 1th, June, 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter and I am so glad to win the prize. Thank you very much! In answer  your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have begun painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will I get any tuition? Finally, I should like to ask some questions. How is the weather like in California in July? What kind of clothes should I pack? If I want to buy some gifts, how much money should I take and can I use traveller's cheques in every place? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our lives are getting better and better, so people began to go shopping more frequently. It's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us  good apart from the temporary satisfaction? Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In  fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under  these tricks. The result,  we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty. Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they? Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out it won't be always enjoyable.  ",37.0

I wasen't expecting this prize because  was to good to be true. My family decide to visit my grandmother in Orlando, because she got some problems with the swiming-pool, she ask my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building. Because  this situation I  be very busy on the first week of july, and I  apreciate  if you can give me the choice to start my ""Camp California""  from July 10th. About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents, because I never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins. Because I seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very kind on this sport, and also I love photography because I got a great Camara. I am really looking forward to see you soon.  [SEP]  When I was a child I never like to go shopping because my Mum spend so much time on the shops that I remember  going shopping with her, was a nigthmare. It is ameaising how people change during the years, for example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something. I enjoy so much fashion that my life change completely since I start to study clothes designer and I discover that fabrics,  colors, are really enjoyable. But in this days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer  and you pay  full price, on the end of the season it is half price, I find  very anfair for people who pay a lot of money on their clothes. Anyway, shopping is allways a satisfation for rich people, because they can afforded  and they don't main to spend  full price on their clothes. ",18.0

I have been informed that all accommodation and travel cost are paid for  the company. I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month. I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in  tents, because I find it more confortable to sleep in  beds, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in  tents. I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before, that means I do not have any experience on the subject. Please let me know the kind of clothes we will be wearing, would I need to take a suit? Are there going to be any formal parties? It is important for me to know if we need  money and in that case, how much money would you recommend me to take? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Manuel P. Martinez  [SEP]  June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set  the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes ",37.0
313," Dear manager, During my stay in London, I visited all the most famous place and I enjoyed  a lot during this days. I love London's musical shows and I read the advertisement for the show called ""over the rainbow"". I've gone to many musical shows where the main actor was Danny Brook and I can say that he is really good. It was my last night in London and I decided to go to this musical show. When I asked for the price I was surprised becaused the seller told  there wasn't any discount available. I showed the advertisement to him and he said it was wrong and I paid the normal price. I bought the ticket for the second session and I went to the theatre at seven o'clock. I had been waiting half an hour outside the theatre and finally it started at a quarter past eight. I was angry about all of this problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong with the actor's name. When the musical show finished I went to the theatre's restaurant and it was closed because it was too late, so I couldn't have dinner there, as it was announced . I wasn't a good evening and I would like to have my money back. Waiting for your answer.  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life and I'll try to explain it. We have been using personal computers for nine years and it's one of the most important changes. Last year I spent ten hours looking for information for my homework. The subject was ""What's happening in Irak?"" I started my research in the town's library and all the information I collected was from a local newspaper. After two hours I thought that all of this information was writted from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion. I used my computer for collecting reports from  internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analize it in two weeks. Internet has changed our daily life: you can find whatever you want. Do you want to have a different lunch? Do you want to organize a different holiday in a strange place? You can find there all you need and more! I can't imagine my parents playing in the street without watching the TV. I couldn't life without modern music. I'm not interested in films without special effects.. And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop it's caming  the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake in a corner's machine without any coin, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more... ",30.0

It is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places. People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life. In my opinion people need a telephone. For example a telephone is very important in job-life. Nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone. Also it is god for people's safety. You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured. The people use the telephone also for their personal life. For example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away. Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone. They are able to give and receive informations very quickly. This invention has made our lives easier and quickier. The telephone has made my own life also easy and quick. It makes something possible you can not do. Finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people. ",29.00
430," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writting to you about the show. I was very disappointed after this show. I would like to have my money back. At first the show started at 10.15, and it should be at 19.30. After your show I wanted to visit my friends, and because of it, I didn't do it. Also, you wrote about discounts, but it's not true! The woman, who sold  a ticket was very roud with me, actually she started swearing at me. During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit  restaurant, it's a pity, but  restaurant was closed because it was too late. And, I forget to say  about  actor, I didn't enjoy them. So, I hope I will get my money back, it was  very disappointing evening out in my life! I hope you understand me! your sincerely Ongelina  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but any way I trusted him. It's happened 3 months ago, and during this  months I am very upset. I have a friend, his name  Peter, he is my best friend. One day Peter killed one boy. They were just playing and be acsident, Peter shoot him. I was there, I saw it. I hoped that it, just could see  3 people, but it was  mistake... Pat saw it! We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret, not to tell anyone. We trusted him. At first several days, Pat all the time was with us. He promised to keep  secret, in the next morning we had  arguiment with Pat,  3 of us were shouting at each other, in shorter Pat went away from us. Two days later in the morning, the policeman came to  Peter... So, now my best friend is  prisoner. All the time I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in the prison  5 years. By the way I don't see Pat  about one year. Perhaps, he moved into another town. It's good that he  far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny... ",9
1164," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference to your last letter concerning the international student conference in our college. I would get you the information you are requested. First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as usually, we would organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wear a suit (for  man) or a skirt (for  woman). Furthermore, this party would be in your hotel like  the following years. Finally, there are a lot of mouseum is our town, therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum which is really fashinating. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  from: for: the group leader. subject: Arboriginal Art Museum. The aim of this report is intended to discribe the biggest building of our town. I am in a position to choose a good building which students like myself are interested in. a) this museum presents more than 200000 original art pictures. b) The building has been buit in 1999, therefore, it is a modern architecture. c) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tour in Paris. d) This building is included: 30 toilets, 500'000 lights, and also 100 people whom can help you if you need any information. I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the eldest civilisation of the world in one of the modernest building. ",26.00
557," Thuesday 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I've just received your letter, and I am very delighted to be the winner. I thank you.. As regards to the time I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only  on July because I am very tied up  this time owing to he exam period which will last until the end of June. I'd rather have accommodation in tents, it would be a good experience for me especially because I haven't lived it as well as it is more romantic. As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do. The swimming is my best sport. I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete. The sea is part of myself. Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball, despite the fact that I am not too tall for this kind of sport. However, I used to play basketball in my school because we hadn't  other sport pitch except of the basket pitch. Finally, would you mind to send me more information about the amount of money that I should have. Also, what about the life out of the camp? Are there other places for entertainment especially for the night life? Could you send me some brochures for the place where we will stay in? Thank you again, and I am looking forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about the short video which my college is going to make about the daily life of our school. It considers two points: the lessons and  activities which should be filmed. I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful. There are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, despite the artificial sunbathing. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is  good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that  owns. In addition, we can film the library which possesses thousand of works. Books of various interest, with up-to-date facilities such as computers  internet, CD and cassettes. We shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better. Finally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim. ",32.0
635," I am writing in reply to your letter, which I have received last week, and in fact I am very surprised and please for the prize. First of all I would like to travel in July because  is my  free month since I am student and I am very busy during all year. Secondly, according to accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a long cabin, due to I used to use the tent on holiday and I haven't got very good experiences. Thirdly I chose photography and swimming because I have previous experience in these activities and of course I have some diplomas which I will send you. In addition, I work every summer as a Monitor in the leisure centre in my town. Apart from this photography is one of my favorite hobbies and I usually spent nearly all my spare time practising it and of course I have some diplomas as well. Lastly I would like to ask you for some questions. On the one hand I would like to have further information about which kind of clothes I need for that area. I don't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both . On the other hand I would like to request all details of accommodation and if you could specifie what this trip includes, since I need to know how much money I have to take. I look forward to receiving a prompt reply. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello it's been ages since we were in touch, I'm sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I have been very busy last month, with this job. I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed  a lot and of course I knew a lot of people there. I found this opportunity through the Radio in an advertisement. On the one hand at first I was a little insure about if I was able to do this job, because they needed people with some skills and experience. But later I decided to call them and ask them for further information about this job. After a interview I was chosen for it, I couldn't believe it. I feel that this was a good oportunity for me, not only for my professional but also for my personal life. Moreover I practised a lot of aspect of my speciality,  for me was the most important real experience. According to my job, I had to help the teams with the outlights and of course it had been my first proffesional experience: at the end I felt  a member of them, because they were so kind to me, and I could colaborated a lot of and I learnt a lot with this project. Furthermore, I found it very short time and they offered me  new project for the summer. I hope to hear from you soon. ",26.0
1196," Dear Mrs Smith I am writing to reply  your letter you wrote  me on 10 June. Firstly, I would like to tell you, that the group has been booked into  Palace Hotel, which locates beside the congress house in the centre. You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888. Secondly, the best way  from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which is specially organized by us. The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening. Off course there's also a bus number 8  in front of the hotel is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour. The end-of-conference party, which happens in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast. Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night. What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful. It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing. The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night. As you see, what to wear is just something casual. Finally, in the last afternoon, we could visit the museums, markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves. I hope your questions re answered appropriatly. I'm looking forward to seeing you on the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Computer Life Now-a-day computer can be found in almost every corner, in offices, in shops. Or even in cars and washmachines there're computer chips. What has computer affected to our life? First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait  the Kasse to take every article's note by hand. When booking a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search  it from  internet or on the local network. It's a very often heard, that someone, who has a special illness, gets  operations by a foreign institutes, which he find via  internet. Moreover, with computer network, it can be possible that people work from home, making projects, controling operations or having conferences. Lastly the way of communications has been also changed. Instead of the tranditional telecommunication, we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of  computer network. Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved. For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as  on papers. A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security. Till now, to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough. In conclusion, computer have become a very essential necessity of our life, and it's still a young invention, which need to be improved. ",27.00
809," Dear Helen Ryan, I have seen your letter for Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now. First of all, you state in the letter that the accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I like being in contact with the nature life. Secondly, from the list of activities that you are also state in the letter I would prefer swimming because when I was a child I practised this sport for 8 years. In addition, I would prefer photography too because I love taking photos. Finally, it would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of clothes I must be taken and how much I will spend during the stay at the Camp. I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't written for so long but as you can imagine I've been pretty busy with my studies. Anyway, the reason I'm writing is that you asked me about my experience with the most famous pop group in America: ""Mana"" Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help in the event. First I didn't accept but finally she conviced me. It was the most excited experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drinks. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepare orange juices. It was grateful because I knew a lot of people and the most important person was Alex, the baterist of the group. You know he is my love! He's good-looking. I enjoyed  very much. Give my love to your family Write soon Love, ",33.0
1072," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London. I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March at 10.00 - 19.00. I would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme. It is very thoughtful of you that you are taking all of us to London. This is  great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself especially, The London fashion and leisure shows. Most of the shows are about fashinable things for the students in my age. I think it is a good programme and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of the shows for instance  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to make up and how to have propiate hairstyles. In my opionion, I think you should organised this programme in the afternoon instead of going for shopping and move the shoping time in the afternoon on Wednesday. I hope this information will help you to understand and put it in your programme. I trust you to pay immidiate attention to my suggestions. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I closed my eyes, tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower. There were hundrend of Thai students were waiting for doing this test. I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous. I was given the lists for doing the activities while I was going to the adventurous school schems at the solder camps in the north of Thailand. There were many tasks that I had to complete for instance, clime up to the mountain,  how to used some kind of guns, and how to survive when I got lost in the forest. The last task I had to do was jume out of the hight tower. The assistants were the real solder and they were very kind and helpful eventhough, they looked very strick and unkind. It was the hardest time for me to do thing like this because I lived in the city most of my life  I had never known about how to survive in the forest and how difficult to work as solders. I eventaully managed to complete all  tasks that I had given  I was very proud of this. ",24.00
510," Dear Mr or Madam, I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play ""over the rainbow"" which is performing at  Circle Theatre. First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage, during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour  fifteen  past after. We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from the promise written in the advertisement. Defineteley, I want my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told  everything about Lynne Harter, our new collegue at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, it was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely agressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth, I continued: ""You can't believe it Pat, she wears trousers like  men and green flowery blouses"" Of course, my friend and I were laughing during half an hour. Two days after, when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told  everything about Ann1. In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well,  unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets. ",29.0
123," Dear Sir, I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see ""Over the Rainbow"", - the musical show -. At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement of the show, nevertheless it has wrong information. First of all, the advertisement of the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot. Appart from that, the show was delayed forty five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry. Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket, which cost me £20. Besides, the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show. Finally I would like to inform you that I had never spent such an umpleasant evening in my whole life. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you - the manager of the theatre - could send me the money back, at least the money I spent on the ticket. Your faithfully LUCCA CALZARI  [SEP]  Unfortunately Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was one of my best friends, but all secrets told to him spreaded throughout the school in a matter of minutes. The worst was that he did it unconciously. When we were in the primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) for his 10th birthday by preparing a fancy dress party in the school. We had been preparing it for three days, we hired fancy dresses, had a cake made by a cook and decorated the gymnasium. Unfortunately, it was me who had to tell Pat about the surprise. Later, I realiced it was the worst thing it could happen to me. On the day of the party, half an hour before it started, Pat came across with a gang of boys from another course. Since they were going to beat him , he desperately told them everything he knew about the party. Afterwards, all of them were around Tim telling him what Pat had confessed. Both Pat and Tim were very disappointed that day. ",28.0
149," 17 May 2000 Dear Sir or Mam, Last weak, I went to London to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". I was realy happy to see the ""Best Musical Show"" in London. But what I saw was exactly the opposite  I expected. In other words, it was a disaster. Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why  were no discounts avaivable? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors  which were not very good in acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed. It wasn't realy a perfect evening like you promised on your flyer. I was very disapointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was. Yours faithfully, Franz Morell Hand  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Unfortunately, modern technology made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for  holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need. Every production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for  worker anymore. Every thing is controlled and produced by machines. This also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to. You never get bored. ",28.0
560," To Whom It May Concern, I'd like to say thank you for choosing me and sending me the letter. I am extremely excited about the camp! For the camp, you need some information from me, don't you? Therefore I am going to write them down. First, I'd like to travel on July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible. Second, I prefer log cabins than tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents. Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities. Because I've started surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing. Also, painting is one of my favorite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint. Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions. I know everything is included and I don't need to pay anything but in case should I bring some money or not? And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount? Also, could you suggest me what kind of clothes I should bring, please? Thank you very much for reading this letter. I really appreciate your choosing me. I am really looking forward  this camp. Thank you. Truly, Yoshiko Murasaki  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Anyway, I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I'd like to write them down! First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I was hired! Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our heart was bumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do so we started working. After working 30 minute, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully! Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusands of funs came in this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert. During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved. Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteres as well. It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you were there with us! Maybe next time! By the way, I think I should go. Please take care and please write to me, right? Love, Yoshiko. ",36.0
693," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to let you know my decision about  your letter, which I have received recently. I would like to thank you for  competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition. I think, I could have an holiday just in July because I will have been working in my previous company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one month holiday period from my company. I would rather prefer to stay in the tent than to stay in the log cabin because the tent is more enjoyable. I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailling because I have been joining these kinds of activities for five year and I had  really good training about sea-sports. Should I take my clothes with me or are they arranged in the camp placement? Also, how much does it cost. I am looking  to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I hope you and all your family are well and everything is ok. I'd like to tell you about what exciting experience I had last month during a pop concert. I wish you were there and saw the concert, it was really brilliant. As you know I'd never been to any activities like to be a valunteer before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an adversitement on the tv. It said, ""be a valunteer for our concert and get a free ticket"". After that I applied and they accepted my application. You should have seen , there was  really terrible rush before  concert and everybody was runing around to do something. I helped to carry huge speakers to the concert venue. Than I was told to stay in front of the entrance door and check the tickets. Some people tried to enter without any ticket but they weren't allowed  by  police. Finally, I helped them,  in return I had  good experience as well as enjoyed listening   music. Love ",28.0
1043," To Mr. Robertson I am writing to tell you something about the three-day trip to London. I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking  and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum. This show is on the 14th March. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start and ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening. Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down. I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion. We like to keep up with the rage but I think it will help those who want to become a fashion designer later on. I have a suggestion on how the programme could be changed. The shopping time could be after the show and the free time exchanged for the science museum. If we go to the show, we can do without the free time. Please give this your careful consideration.. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  In a country like the UK, we are all bound to have houses. We either own it, or we simply borrow it from other people. We take our homes for granted. Think about the people in the poor countries! They struggle to survive. However, as we approach the future, our homes will start to change. Have you ever thought about how the changes will affect our lives? I doubt it. There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities. For one, the future homes might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass. Non-breakable glass. Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and  risk of flooding will also rise. Therefore, houses will be built on high supports. All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated. Incredibly high security will prevent robbery. The future homes will also have many similarities, such as having a separate bathroom, and not having one in a bedroom, or having two floors or having garages. It has been a pleasure sharing my thoughts with you. What do you think will happen in the future? ",32.00
1212," Dear Mrs Smith, I have just read your letter and I am happy to help with giving you some further information. According to your first question, for the time of  conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel, where the reservation has been already made. It is situated near to our college, about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station, which is South Wimbledon. As you were informed, there will be a party for all attendants of the conference, which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant. Minding the fact that it will be  entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event. Finally, answering your last question about  student's day-out, I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and  Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions. If you have any further questione, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TO: Leader of the group of American students FROM: DATE: 12.06.2001. SUBJECT: Recomnendations of a place to visit INTRODUCTION: The aim of this report is to give  description and  recommendation of the most interesting building in the town. GENERAL INFORMATION: The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth-century Royal Palace. It is situated in a heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of an Old Town. There is a square old Market with the magnificent statue of the King Zygmunt, in the centre of it. FACILITIES: . Inside the Palace, there is a museum of an antique collection of porcalaine. . There is also a Portrait Gallery in the left wing of the Palace. . The Old Town is the best place for  afternoon stroll with a great deal of restaurants, caffes and street performers. . There is an easy reach to cashpoints, lavatories, emergency services, etc. POSITIVE POINTS . It is easy to get there by any sort of public transport . There are  numbers of hotels or youth hostels  to stay overninight, if necessary . Most of the admissions are absolutely free. NEGATIVE POINTS . A part of the Palace might be closed, due to the constant renovations. . All the facilities are usually overcrowded during a summer holiday. CONCLUSION: Despite the few drawbacks, I would strongly recommend the Royal Palace as the most suitable place to visit for the foreign students. ",36.00
1136," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all, I want to thank you in the name of the class for your good organisation and programme,  Especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time. We really appreciate this. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from 10 oo to 19 oo o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall. There will be shown the latest fashions about leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't been ever before in this kind of show. As well as this, the entrance for students is free. As you can see this is the best time to go there. We have some suggestions about how to change the programme. Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something. To sum up, this is a really great opportunity for us and I don't think that the changes are so big. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  The man is a being that need to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him. As well as this he needs his own free space and privacy. This is also  important to him as friendship and family In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press. Just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The yellow press is searching for every little  information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people, just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat. The photos will be on tomorrow's press and so rumours are born. On the other hand the people have choose to walk on this path. Everything in life has a price. The price for fame and money is the lost of privacy. First of all you have to give up something for getting something else. However, the press shouldn't create rumours and hunt those people like animals. As well as this, the stars shouldn't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy. They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before. The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous. ",35.00
788," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I'm writting to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that Camp. I'm going to give you all the information you need from me. I only can travel I July, because it is when I stop playing basketball to rest before starting the new season. I don't mind staying wherever you want me to. However, I prefer log cabins to tents. They're more comfortable. According to the activities I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal  me much, but I'm quite good at Golf. I like surfing and playing tennis,  such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it. there'are no more questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writting to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday. It was such a beautiful night! Unforgetable. I had always dreamt of being near ""The Cranberies"", but I had never thought that the dream could became reallity. During the afternoon, Tim and me spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held. AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there for starting queueing. We bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest. After a few minutes the dream happened: Kare - the guitarrist - appeared over there. At first we both thought we were dreaming but when we realised it was true we went there and ask him some questions. And then we bring his guitar for him. It was great to help him. Finally he said how thankful he was and alowed us to stay with them till the concert started. That's all. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Aladdin ",30.0
1118," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing on behalf  my English class. We have just known the programme you prepared for our three-day trip to London. Thank you very much for  many interesting positions in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are shure, will be very exciting. I would like to inform you, that we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Laisure Show"" and we have found it very interesting. There will  a lot of show for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be  great opportunity, because the entrance is free for students. The even is planned on  14th of March between 10.00 am and 19.00 p.m. If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme. We will be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday's afternoon. We have checked that it is open every day. As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be  nice prize for our work during this year. I would b grateful if you  consider our suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was night and I was alone in my house. Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it. The outside lights were broken down and I couldn't see anything. My dog was very angry. I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get to my house. After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen's window. I was very frethend, but I knew, that I should do something. I had no time to call someone and I had to go to my kitchen to check what it was. I stood against the window and I started to listen. I was shure there were someone on the other side of the wall. It was terrible, I thought that it was the last day of my life. Suddenly someone broke my window. I had no time to think, I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head. One moment later I called  police. He was a thief, who were looked for for many years. ",31.00

525," Dear Sir/Madam, I would like to point out the problems  when I went to watch your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at the Circle Theatre. On your advertisement, you have written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I have expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing. Also, the times printed on your advertisment was 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late. On your advertisment, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available. I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and on your advertisment, it made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting. However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated. It was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisment said it would be, and I would like some refund back. I hope you would give these problems your immediate attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind  not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever? When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends. I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce. When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day,  to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse. However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and  told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager. My happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car. The news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover. I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now. I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret. ",39.0
467," Saturday, June 17th, 2000. Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" that has been presented in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre in the last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with that. First of all, I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced  to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and the principal point: it started forty five minutes later. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder  you could explain  me why. Due to my huge dissatisfaction, I would like my money back, as you do not make what was advertised. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, MANUELA REVES RAVERNO  [SEP]  The influence of modern technology Every day, the growth of the modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life. Today, almost no one can live without, for example, a television, a radio or electricity in their homes. The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good aspects to my life, like the facility to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image in my cab TV and in my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of comodity can led us, in the future, to a completely ""cold"" world, because of the distance between people that can be caused. Another bad points can be mentioned, like the polution for example. Despite the bad aspects that the modern technology can bring, in my opinion, if the governments tryed to do the best, and if everybody contribute with a little bit, we can solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lifes.

459," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago. I went to see it on 5th June 2000. First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor. Secondly the show started 45 minutes late. Then at the tickets-office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite  I am a student. Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished, obviously, late. I am really not satisfied with the show-organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different. For this reason I expect to receive my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secret. Last week we had another demostration of this. On Monday we decided to organize a surprise-party for Ted's birthday on Tuesday evening. Each of us had a different task. Anna prepared the cake, Peter organized the music, Heather and I went to buy the present; Pat said: ""OK I'll phone to some of Ted's friends to invite them"". Obviously Ted should  have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice: ""the party is a secret!!"" and she said: ""Yes, it must be a surprise!"" On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details; Pat said: ""I've just phoned to Tommy, Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening: they all have said ok for the party.."" In that moment she understood that something was wrong! ",32.0
338," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to complain about the show which I saw in your theatre. During  staying in London, I had read your advertisement and planned to enjoy seeing the musical show. I had expected that I could have spend a wonderful night. But it was completely different one  which I had expected. I had been looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Can you imagine how disappointed I was when I saw the different actors on the stage? According to the advertisement the show is to start at 19:30. However it did at 20:15. We had to wait for 45 minutes! Could you understand how boring it was just sitting with nothing to do.? You mention about discounts, too. But no discounts were accepted. In addition your theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was sick! I felt so uncomfortable and the night was not perfect at all. I insist you should refund all the money that I wasted in your theatre. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Modern technology has really changed our daily life. For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is  freezing morning. We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house. The housekeeping work doesn't take much time thanks to electrical equipments. And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad. Further, we can get many information as you like at a moment with  internet. In addition, we can travel to anywhere in the world within a few days. These are  advantages which modern technology has brought to us. But I must accept that there are some disadvantages caused by the technology, as well. The biggest disadvantage is pollution. In these days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life. Air pollution by cars, Soil pollution by industrial wastes. The sea is also polluted by oil and  chemical detergent which is used at  home. Even food is polluted. All these facts mean that our modern life gives big damage to the earth. All of us must notice this fact. And we should keep our attention paid in order save our precious earth. ",31.0

First of all, I need to tell you that it is only possible for me to travel in July, because I am going to move to Spain in August. About my accommodation prefers, I would really like to be in a tent. Everytime I travel around, I sleep in nice rooms with nice beds; that is why I think it is a good option to sleep in sleep-bags. From the activities I can choose to do in these two weeks, I would enjoy playing basketball and climbing. I think it would be funny to play basketball after  five years; and since I go out to the mountains once a month, I don't think I would have any problem with climbing. I would like to ask you some questions: Could you tell me what kind of clothes would be addecuate for these two weeks? How much money do you think I should bring with me? Thank you once again for your attention and interest. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Gloria Ortega  [SEP]  Dear Kim You are going to be jealous when you hear this. As I told you in my last letter, I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert. The pop group were all young people (between 23 - 30 years old), and all of them were really nice. Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people), consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,... The job was hard, but from my point of view, it was worthful. I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun. Every five working hours, we had thirty-minutes break to eat something. We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons. The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day . That was fantactic! If you have never been there, I enormous recemmend you to go. Even I played the drums there! I hope your exams are doing well, and you write me back when you finish them. Lots of love ",30.0

I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it, we were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, the last day was the worst thing we have got, which was your musical show. At first, you said that, if we had bought 5 tickets, we would have had a discount, but we didn't have anything. Secondly, we booked  the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15, what's wrong with your clock?. Thirdly, someone on stage was very strenge for me, because I expected to see ""Danny Brook"", but I didn't. The last one, we wanted to have a dinner in your restaurant after a terrible musical show, but we couldn't have it, because a waiter said your chef had gone home. I have no idea what your business is, I have never seen something like this. By the way, I want you to pay  my money back for the waste time, and I think that you understand. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Have you ever been in the Countryside? Try it, it doesn't need to take a long time to live in that place, but it will give you many things, which are different from your lifestyle in  city. Nowadays you wake up in a morning, go to school or work by the sky-train, start your lessons with the computer, go for shopping in a store which has an air-conditioner, watch cartoons on TV, or cook by a microwave oven etc. Do you really enjoy it? Althoug the modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it gives you natural, peace and fresh air? How much the technology gives to you, it take from you more. Have you heard about the environment pollutions, the healthy problems and the moral problems?

519," Dear Sir, I'm writing in order to make you know how angry I am for having gone to one of your shows. I went to London for a week's holiday with some friends and every evening we decided something to do in order to enjoy our staying in that beautiful city. I wish we had never chosen your show. In fact, only after having going into the theatre, I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show. First of all, when I paid  my ticket I noticed that nobody could obtain the discount you'd written about. But that would be nothing if I thought to dinner I had to cancelled because your show started at 20.15, although it should have been at 19.30! Besides, when we decided to spend the evening in the theatre restaurant, we were informed that it was closed because the chef was ill. At that point, even if there had been Danny Brook as the advertisement announced, it wouldn't have been a less disappointing evening. According to all these things, I ask  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but I realized it only when it was too late. What have moved me to this discover were the facts that happened last month. I had just quarreled with Jon, who is my fiance. In that period we weren't getting on with . So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking at the consequences. And there would have been no problems if I hadn't talked to Pat about that evening. It was only a dinner with a friend and in fact we'd spent all the time remembering our childhood, but probably Pat can have thought that Peter and I weren't only friends. So she ran to Jon in order to make him know  the terrible mistake I had made that evening. He became very angry no matter how hard I tried telling him the truth. By the way, I've understood I had better trust in nobody. ",28.0
258," Dear Manager, My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, wich took place in your stablishment, The Circle Theater, that made me feel very upset. First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very exited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began. I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne, the show must begin on time, but it started forty five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seeing before, and the restaurant was closed with no advise. At last, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible. Yours Sincerelly,  [SEP]  In our days, technology has become a very common thing, even among children. It is such an evolution for  human race, however we can not forget that it can cause some problems too. Firstly, the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade, with the devellopment of telephones, radio stations, television and even satelites, and of course, the internet, gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this provided health and education researches to increase as well. In the other hand, technology has made the differences between - poor and rich people to grow at a high level, and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries. I addition to that, people will always be affraid of the technological war. In conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a  new area to explore, we have to use it with a great amount of responsability, for us all to survive in the future.

Secondly, in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays. In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there. I would be grateful if you  do it. Finally, I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers.

Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have. It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it. In this case we are going to focus on me. Emilio Almodar, 18 years old, University Student, and the career I have choosen is  Internacional Commerce or Market. I use technology every moment but I did not realise. For example, when I come back home from university and I call my friends, I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and  fax  and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that. We also have five computer, the latest versions of them, because they are useful for my father to work  and for me to do some special works for University. This machines are connected to  Internet, and it gives to my family too much facility to get  every  information we want, from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday's football match. In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in  U.S.A. It's really amazing. Apart from this, I don't spent my free time in technology. I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends, because technology is not all  life, but it is only a little part of it. ",25.0

132," June 17 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you about my complaints of mine about the musical show of your theater, that I have watched a week ago, during my stay in London. That evening, the problems started with the tickets... On the contrary with  the advertisement, that was published on the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International Student Identity card. Secondly, the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed. Another problem was the starring male actor: the well known and talented actor, mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the theater restaurant, which was said to be open and available for meals after the show; but it was closed. So, I did not have the ""perfect evening out"" as stated in your advertisement. I think you owe me an excuse and a full refund. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Clothes of the Future Have we ever seen a naked person in the streets? Except  some very extraordinary cases, no. Tell me, why  people care so much about what they wear and what others wear? Because, the clothes have a crucial part in our everyday lives. Maybe because of this, just like living things, the clothes have evolution. This evolution has never stopped and it will continue. How about the clothes of people, a hundred years later? In my opinion the clothes of the world, after a century , will be styled in the Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout the history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be ""out"". Of course, the technology will change too. Maybe, new kinds of fabrics, that are capable of insulating light, or heat will be used. Actually, some clothes like that are being developed today; but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future. Finally, it seems to me that, the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalist and minimalist and also, the fabrics that are used will change too. In fact, we can not know, what will the time give and take away, so let's wait and see: the clothes of the future. ",34.0

I would love it! Moreover, how much money will I need if I want to go out at night? These are some further details I keep wondering about. I'm looking for your answer. Yours Sincerely Ignace Cloutier.  [SEP]  Daily life at school: What should be filmed. First of all, I would like to lay the emphasis on the fact that this report can be seen by the director of the school. Therefore it must be objective. Then it may improve our day life at school. It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at the final examination. Then I would like to film the computer rooms. Sometimes there is so much people that you have to wait half an hour to get one computer. If only we could get some new ones. Eventually, it would be nice to make a sequence with lots of sports activities. It would bring some rhythm to the video. Moreover it will show of  healthy the students are. These are some ideas we could discuss over. ",38.0
1117," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing in the name of the whole class. First of al, I want to thank you for the interesting programme, which you already have organised. It is very good, especially the Sightseeing tour by bus. However, we have seen an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London. There we can see everything about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. The entrance for student is free. This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education. Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon. The shopping could be done after the river trip to Greenwich but only if we have enough time. I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesistate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Will the home of the future really look different? It's quite difficult to say, but of course there will be a change. For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home  with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern, especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom. in the future it could be that you don't have to prepare your breakfast by your own, perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone . In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table, tidying up the house,  doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners. The place to spend the night will still be the bed. The livingroom won't get any big changes although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult. In general we can say the huge change we already had, but who knows exactly what the future will bring to us? Let's have a surprise? ",32.00
81," 17th December, 2000 Jane Clark, organizer Dear Madam, I'm writing this letter to congratulate you for the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy last November. I found it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions. First of all, because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting. Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because  the short number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival. Finally, the prize was reasonably and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend. I hope you'll attend my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Once upon a time, in a small Catalan village, there was a little boy who loved cheating and making jokes. His father was a shelter,  He had one hundred sheeps and one dog, and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them. One day, he became ill and was worried about the animals. His little son, called Joan, decided quickly: ""I will help you. I will take care of the sheeps for you, father"". the next day he went to the mountain with the animals. At the beginning he was excited but soon he got bored. ""Let's have a bit of fun"", he thought. And then he started shouting: ""the fox! Help me! the fox!"" Some people went to help him, and then realised that it was not true. They were angry. He did it  more times, and at last nobody cared of the shoutings. One day, the fox attacked his animals and he shouted as much as he could. Nobody came. Then he learned to say always the truth. ",31.00
167," Sir manager of the theatre, I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show in your theatre. With a friend we had seen your advertisement for the show, witch was very attractive. Unfortunatly, the musical show didn't go like the advertisement explained, and that wise I wont ask you  some money back. The starring had been changed, the show had started only at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside. And your last phrasal of the advertisement  ""Your perfect evening out""! it wasn't  at all, like I have explain  you above in this letter. I thank you in advance an hope for a positive requiere. Bests regards,  [SEP]  At the began of my work in a Insurance Company, I had only a old writting machine, witch makes a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with it because the switch were hard for my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, witch is very easy to use, and confortable for my fingers  also more farrster. But wen the computer don't work, I got a big problem to do my work. Also now for write a letter to a friend overland it is better with  Internet. It is so practical, in five minuts my friend can read my letter. And he can ansewer me very quickly. I think, it is now the futur for the big company for work with the Internet. ",19.0
49," Dear Ms clark: I am writing to give suggestion for the international art festival, which I have been to one weeks before. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year. Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it is very interesting, especially for the young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time  very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world  on the advertisement, but in fact they are from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls are too small, could you consider making them bigger next year. The plays and films were really wonderful, people liked them very much, so could you play more next year The last thing is about the ticket. It was excellent about one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this. I hope that you can consider my suggestions. I really look forward to going to the festival next year. Yours sincerely:  [SEP]  Dear Jacob: I'm very glad to hear from you. I hope everything is ok. I'm really sorry I didn't write you back immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you. In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet during the lessons, we should go there in the brake. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt, I don't like it. If I can, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success at once, we should give them  second chance to try. Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home,  just don't take trouble to my family, that's all. OK, just here. I look forward to hearing from you soon. All the best wishes and good luck. yours: ",28.00
666," Dear Helen Ryan, I'm writing to you with regard to the letter I've just received as I wish to give you some further information about myself. I would rather travel on July because I'm not as busy as on June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather. Regarding the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep  and they aren't very cozy. Regarding the activities I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, but I expect the water to be as crystal clear. I've also chosen singing. I'm an awful singer, but I would like to learn. I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very extrict vegan, and to suggest me what kind of clothes to bring. I'm really looking forward to my stay at Camp California and to your response in this regard. Yours sincerely, Nuria Valverde.  [SEP]  Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video? Well, I've just polled some students and here are their responses. 70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because  is one of the lessons they enjoy the most. The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun. 60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video  they can also have fun at school. Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring. In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because  is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it. But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows how breaks are  and what students do during them. In a nutchel I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed. Nuria Valverde. ",32.0

I prefer to stay in log cabins  than in tentes, because log cabins has much esctructure, that I need to stay for a few days. . I can play well basketball, because I use to practice basketball, when I go to the club every Saturday. Now I am planning to be a good photographer. I will use some photographs to put in one website, that belongs of one magazine, that I had projected. last year. . How much money would  like to pay me for five hours a day in two weeks working with children?  [SEP]  2 Most part of students are very shy when the teachers ask them if they have one doubt in some subjects at the classes. The students at school shoudn't be shy, because they have estercotipie inside in some issues, that confuses them the means of things. 3 When you are ready to shopp, some times you know before what is your priority to buy, because probaly you need one thing  than others. But the best thing that we do, when we make shopp is spend the time having lunch at  snack bar, watching cinema and play games computer. 4 Hello Kim, Last month, I work like  roadie at  Rolling Stones Pop Concert, I was responsable of  sound that comes from the stage.

1013," Dear Mr Robertson My name is ... and I am a student representative. I am writing to you on behalf of my class concerning our trip to London. First of all I would like to thank you for organizing the programme. I read it and found it very good, specially,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts. However, I have a great proposition for you. Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I thing it is a great opportunity for us, as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students. Girls should like to see the latest fashion, new make-up and interesting hairstyles. Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear. I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing form you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  THE HOME OF THE FUTURE Home is an important element in everybody's life. It gives you safety. I do not know people who would not want to have a home. We like our houses that is why  are always trying to make it more comfortable and useful. I think The Home of the Future will be bigger as we will need more room for us, our belongings and interests. The construction will be more simple what will give us a feeling of balance. More houses will have gardens what will make us feel closer to the nature. Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside. I do not think so. Because of computers we will have the possibility of working at home, therefore, home will be  very important place worth paying attention . Take care of your home, do not hesitate  in it and you will be very happy. ",30.00
280," Dear Mr. Smith; I am writing this letter to make you know  the bad points of the theatre. First, it didn't start at 19.30. It started at 20.15. We had to wait for 45 minutes. I got bored. Not only me but also the others got bored. It was wrote in the newspaper that Danny Brock took place in the play. But it was not Danny Brock, it was a different actor. If there had been a problem, it would have been told us. I wanted to see him but I couldn't see . This was very disappointing for me. When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount. But in the newspaper it was wrote to be a discount. I paid £20 to the cashier. I was hungry and I thought I could eat something at the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed without any reason. It was very rude. For this, I want my money back. Because I didn't enjoy  at the theatre. I hope you would not continue like this. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES Technology is the thing that makes our life easy. Technology is in every part of our life. We use cars, trains, ships or planes when we want to go somewhere. But if they weren't made, we would have to walk or go by a horse or donkey. With the help of technology, we do our works in less time. For example; in the past people used horses to go  another place. And their life passed in the ways. But now we use planes to go  far  places. It takes less time than going by horse. And computers,  the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day by playing  computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their works. They connect with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes into the computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of note books and they also had to find places to hide them. But it has also bad points. For example; wars. Using technology scientists make lots of powerful guns. It is bad for the world's piece. I think we should use the technology for the piece and use it for our fortune. ",24.0
566," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan; I recieved your congratulations letter for having won the first prize in your competition. I am very greatfull and I want to thank you very much for letting me do this trip. I think it is very kind of yous to ask me what my preferences are for the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel  the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays starts. Answering another of your questions, I am more likely  to stay in a log cabin considering that I will be to weeks in the camp. They are much more confortable than tents. While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing. I have not done any of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it. I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes should I take, and how much money do you think I will need to bring with me. I want to thank you again for letting me have this unique experience. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  [SEP]  Dear Kim; How are you? I's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Anyways, do you remember my last e-mail, where I told you that I was going to help at a Pop Concert. Well, I'm going to tell you about that awesome experience. The band played at my school so we could raise money for our graduation trip. I asked them if they could play at our school and they told me it would be 350 pounds. ""The Moicznos"" are so popular that we sold our every ticket and end up wining 2000 pounds. Appart from calling them, I also helped building up the stage, and took care of the lights. After the concert the whole class helped cleaning up the mess the people left. I can tell you that it was a wonderfull experience. What I liked the most about it is not the fact that we raised a lot of money, but that we enjoyed of an amazing show in which I took  active part. The band thanked me very much for calling them and having everything so well organized. I hope you liked reading my story. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",34.0
341," Dear Mr. ... It wasn't the first time for me to visit this show in your theatre, but it was the worsed one. At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket therefor becauses I'm one of the greatest fan of Danny Brook. It's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it, because I'm (alowed?). When  musical started at 20:15 (not at 19:30 as showed) I was realy shokked when I realised that a different actor was playing . I couldn't stay any more and had to leave the theatre. You have to know that I am very sik because of my blood presure and so I was laying down the hole weekend. In my opinion it's a simple way for you to pay me the money I left back. Otherwise I have to contact my lower. I am waiting hearing of you.  [SEP]  For me as an scientist it's a main problem to show how the inovations of the last century goes up with the environment and natur. In  past new technologies  mostly followed by ground-, water- or air pollution. A nowadays simple thing like a computer include so many possible ways  to destroy different environmental compartiments. On the one hand there are the materials from which the PC's are made of, on the other hand is the uge waste problem situated. Now I try to show, in my daily work, how the airborn chlororganics, which are degased from plastics, will be seperated and damaged by green plants. Sometimes it seems to me like  joke if I remember all the daungerous materials I need to do my job. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the only way to find a better kind of living with the nature is to check out the problems we have. Therefore it make sense to use the inovation which are standing for environmental destructions. ",15.0
584," Madam, I am sending you this reply with the informations that you need. I would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year. About the acomodations I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to stay in it when I travel. The activities that I want to do in the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall as well as I use to play it very well. On the other hand I don't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it  cool. There is one thing I would like to ask you. It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend with food and this kind of thing. Yours Sincerely Adriano Tudela  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this  one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem. Sometimes, shopping can be really bore especially in important dates when the shop are absolutaly crowded and you can't see somethings as you wanted with carefull. ",20.0
302," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show, ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" a few days ago. I am writing this letter to tell you how I felt disappointed with it. There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show. With the advertisement, you mentioned Mr. Danny Brook and Ms. Tina Truelove were going to play but actually different people were playing, whom I have never seen before. And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it was not started until 20:15. To make it worse, neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available. According to the owener of the restaurant, it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off. As I am writing, it was not a perfect evening at all but horrible, so I would like to ask for  money back and compensate for my special 20th birthday. I am waiting for your reply as soon as possible.  Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Fashion Of the Future There have been already a variety of fashion style nowadays. Some are in formal others are in casual. Especially in big cities such as London, New York and Tokyo, you can see a lot of people in various clothes, so I do not think there will be such big differences in  outlooking of clothes even 100 years from now. However, I think, there will be some diffences in  quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made in especially swimming costumes and athletes' costumes for  Olympic. In addition, I think the earth will be warmer and warmer than now and 100 year from now will be an Area of Space. So clothes for space will be necessary and clothes for warmer climates will be necessary. In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think,  better quality in clothes will be created in every field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space. although  outlooking such as, shape and color will not be changed so much in fashion.

One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel wild life more than  I stay in log cabins.

First day in London, I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me. But I was really disappointed  it. First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement. Also, it was certain to me  to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student. But, it was not availiable. Second, I went to the theatre  exactly seven thirty in the evening. However the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted time too much for waiting. It was not good to me, cause I had only one week holiday in London. Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word ""Stuff vacation"" on the front door after the show. It was absolutely different from your leaflet.

I think the people will wear convenient clothes with  simple design in the future. Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer. And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk. However, if they have some special day when like  important public day or special day of their life, they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you  never seen before. Some of that will be very strange to our eyes, but some of  others will be familiar to us. And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc. Maybe some peoples are nakid. It will be very interesting... Just imagine the way of future people's life. And you can see the their clothes also.  ",21.0
905," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for the letter which I have received with a great delight and excitement. I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have required. First of all, I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and I believe the weather would be best for camping in July. And if it is possible I would like to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I find tents uncomfortable to sleep in. The two activities I would like to do at the Camp are Tennis and surfing. I have been playing Tennis for many years and it is my favourite sport. However, I have never done surfing before but I have always wanted to learn how to do it and I believe this would be my best chance to do so. Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies. Also the amount of money I need to bring (is there any shops). And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like. Thank you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who does art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school. When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert. We were all given different sort of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers. It was the best day of my life and certainly for others, too. I wish you were there. It was fantastic. I will be looking forward to your reply. Love from ",40.0
565," 13/06/00 Dear Helen Ryan I am really pleased to hear from you  I won first prize in the competition. It is the thing I really want. How I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter. First, I am afraid but I can travel only in July. I've got  three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August. I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee. So July is the only month I can take part in your activities. Second, regarding accomodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer. And I love to learn surfing and painting. I am quite good at swimming but I never tried to do surfing. So this time I am really keen on learning that. I also love painting. I expect you have lovely nature in California for me to draw on my canvas. Let me ask a question about clothes and money. What kind of clothes do I need and how much money do I have to take. I am really looking forward to going there and  your reply. Yours faithfully Yun Sandra  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I love shopping. But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable. For example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually  traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment. However, people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service. For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them. Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping. Otherwise they can have lots of problem and  difficult to live. ",27.0

We  all very happy with your programme, especially we like the idea of  sightseeing by our and  National Art Gallery.

And all of it is free, According to your programme we have the science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping. Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then  for the shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday? All  students will be very greatful . your sincerly  [SEP]  I think for all of us home is something which is a very important. Home sweet home. We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome. Anyway home is always the place to go because  is ours we feel save and comfortable . Home sweet home.

Working long hours, doing plenty of activieties, going out, going on holidays. We even don't spend time with  families. Propably in the future we might be to busy to go to our own home and spend some time there. But in the end of the day it alway will be  place to go! We find our family there and our life. Some of us have been living in  one house since they were born. We are sentimental and we have memory from the past. I think it's a part of our life.lf ",29.00
972," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in you competition. I am writing in order to give you all the details that you need from me. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I think California is better in Summer. Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because cabins seem to be more comfortable than tents. According to your letter, I will be able to take part in two activities at the Camp. Let me tell you that I would like to sing and play tennis. As a matter of fact, I am very good at both of them. Finally, I would like you to tell me if I will need some special clothes. If the answer is yes, could you tell me which kind of clothes I will need. One other thing, it would be useful to know if I will need to take with me some extra money. If the answer is yes, could you tell me how much money I will need to take with me. I look forward to receiving you reply. Yours sincerely, DENIS JIMENEZ  [SEP]  Introduction This report is to suggest which lessons and activities should be filmed in order to make the video about daily life at school. Lessons and Activities suggested Lessons attended in the language laboratory. Special lessons attended in the library.

Conclusion I would recommend the lessons and activities mentioned above in order to make the video in question. ",40.0
585," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, i am writing to reply  your questions about me. Firstly, I would like to thank you abut this big opportunity you give me to visit this wonderful place like California. I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a leaving for the other months of Summer. Also, I prefer to stay in  tents because I think it is a good chance for me to live with the nature and to wake up listening birds which  singing. It will be nice! Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose. To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing. I'm good in both of these. I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like a lot music and everybody tells me that I have a good voice. I would like ask you about the weather. I want to know if I should bring warm clothes or not and how much money. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, how are you? Thanks for you letter. It was good to hear from you now. As you know this Summer I really enjoy myself doing things I like a lot. Last month, Alice and her friends proposed  me   to help at a pop concert. The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future. All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to control during it about the sound. The concert lasted four hours and in the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the concert of ""Savage Garden"" in live and because that night was the best of my life. But the thing I particularly liked about my experience, was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with the people so famous. OK! That's all for now. I'm waiting for your letter. See you soon, Margaret xxx P.S. I hope you will find the spare time to visit my country this Summer. ",30.0
908," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I was writting as reply of your letter, I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA. About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I  got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month  holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months. With the accomodation, I would prefered  tents becase it is more according with a camp. And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things. Finally I just  ask you What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me, and around How much money do you think I will need. Thank you very much for everything. Your Sincerely Juanita Fabiola Martin  [SEP]  31 Sea old State Valles Co. Cornel Wales 13th June, 2000 Dear Kim, Here I am, writting  you to tell  everything about my wonderful experience at the concert. You can't imagine How much did I enjoy that journey. I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played, I help with the music stuff like speakers, mics, lights, sound , etc. And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started. And I was helping them fixing the last details. When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty. After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean. Later the band was talking to me, I could get their new album free, and some other souvenirs from the band. But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions. So, that's everything that I can tell you, I enjoy  a lot and I hope to have another experience like this. ",27.0
462," Dear Sir/Madam During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre. I found your advertisement in the tourism officis and how the musical ""Over the rainbow"" seemed to be a good option I choose it. The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed  a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm  student but I paid  a full ticket). How it was explained above, I'm not satisfied and I want to be   refund. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend which is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot. We'll understand why I'm writing in the past. Last weekend we diced to go to the bach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend). When we arrived there Eingrid and Pat decided to take a sunbath while I and Nik walked in the sand. Lyter a long time walking we decided to return and how the weather was so hot we  found a place to drink something. Then I found an ex-girlfriend that Eingrid hates. We had a little conversation and suddenly she kissed me, but I refused to continue. I called Nick to go search  the girls (he was in the WC) and said goodbye to she. When we met the girls Eingrid was furious, she said  me that Pat had saw me kissing another girl and our relationship was over! I'm really very unlucked.  ",26.0
247," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the rainbow, that took place in the Circle Theatre. There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisment. The first problem was about the actors. In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play  main roles. But I was very disappointed when I didn't see them on the stage. The second problem was the time of the play. The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I was waiting for the show for a half-an-hour! The third problem were the discounts. The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not. The last problem was the theatre restaurant. It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunatelly it was closed. To conclude, I am not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a fully refund. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  There are many different creatures on Earth: animals, insects, plants. But the most developed creature is a human. He lived  nearly 10 000 years. During this time men had developed and now are the leading creatures. They built huge cities, destroyed forests, got into space. Now, modern technology has changed our life. And, naturally, it has both advantages and disadvantages. The modern technology, on the one hand, made our life easier. We use different electric kettle. We build big cities, there are hot and cold water, electricity, gas in particulary every home. We use different transport that makes our moving faster, it fastens our life. We communicate with other people by telephone,  mail, we read newspapers, we watch television,  get different information from  internet. But, on the other hand modern technology destroyed our life. Factories polluted the air we breath, shops polluted the water we drink. Many different uncureable diseases appeared. For example: cancer occured in Africa after American nuclear tests All in all, technology made our life better by destroying the environment. In future possibly the technology wouldn't destroy the environment, but we have to do something now, because tomorrow can be too late. ",24.0
212," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which I have seen in The Circle Theatre on 6th June. On that date, I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in  musial show. But things started to go wrong from the beginning. The first problem was the price of tickets. I expected to buy  ticket cheaply but no discounts were available. Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late. I found the theater rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row. Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time. However, something wrong came up again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brocher, did not play a part in the show. And I  really disappointed from the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after  show, but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior. I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from  advertisement. I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund. I expect to receive a cheque for £20.  look forward to hearing soon. Yours faithfully    [SEP]  It's comletely different! Have you ever been to  fashion show named ""New trend, New Millenium""? 'It's completely different! How can we go our wearing thouse clothes?' This is what my friend said the other day when she went to see the show with me. These days, new designs and new trends are coming out every day, sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days  we were young. However, It doesn't seem to take long for most of young people to get used to it, so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future. In my opinion, I believe that clothes indicate  individual's creativity as well as social situation. We never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age. On the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre to wear nothing. Let's face it. Clothes are always changing. But the question no one  answer is what is  fashion in 100 year's time?  ",30.0
399," The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show ""Over the Rainbow,""  I attended to, a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset  when I realized that the  expected famous actor Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy; this entertainment did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. More over, I was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing  as, indicated on your adverts, but I, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it  happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. ""A Perfect evening out""!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque of £15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had made my own experience with her so far and I would be always careful not to tell her anything important when ever we met. As, Pat had recently made a new friend with Olga, my sister, I warned my sibling about Pat's failing: ""Don't ever rely on Pat for keeping a secret, Sweet-Heart; she just can't""! Mind what you may tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping around is her favorite leisure activity! However, I guess that Olga turned a deaf hear to what I had told her. This is the impression I got. A couple of weeks later, my sister called me as I was at work; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears, she could, hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then, feel her, upset as ever. I could get her as well simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably: - ""Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat"", hurled Olga  at me, through the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the ""poor cow""! ",31.0
299," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to you in order to describing my last visit in your theater. Unfortunatly I am a very disappointed about  organisation in your company. Firsty the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price  £20 because discounts were not available although on your advertisement there were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the grateful Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and it was singing a mother unknown person. And last but not least I recognised after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come... I don't know  it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatrer that  is promised much more then the people can get for their money, or  it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I am not agree with such  situation and would ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed. I am looking forward for you answering. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously. First of all it changed our life-style. For example ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TV. Because the people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobil and can spend their free-time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more open for the world. Secondely we can do our jobs today more efficient. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our partner faster and better and offer them better service. The ordered goods can be deliver in  shorter time by train, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more for our daily life - for better clothes, furniture, spare time. I am a fan for modern technology. ",23.0
922," Dear Madam, With regard to your letter, I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible such a wonderful event as your competition is. If it was possible id prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July. In August I'll be working, so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month. About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp. My two activities chosen from the list are climbing and surfing. My skills in these activities are very different: while in climbing, this will be the first time I climb. In surfing learning won't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old. It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me. Yours sincerely Gil Sanchez  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not having written  you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting  you has been the accummulation of exams during this month. Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did you know I'm one of them? There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers. During the two hours of concert we had to attend  thirty-six people, who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! It's the best thing you can do in this case. Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon. Lots of love.

283," Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about your musical show which I saw last Saturday. According to your advertisement, one of the stars was supposed to be Danny Brook. However, a different actor play the role instead of him. You can imagine how upset I felt, as I really wanted to see his performance. To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start from 7:30 p.m, it started from 8:15 p.m. What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off. On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available. I was really disappointed at your show. I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and  discomfort which I suffered. I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In these days, young people prefer wearing shabby and scruffy clothes to wearing neat and tidy clothes. In other words, their fashion has become more casual. I think this tendancy will become more common in the future. In general, their parents don't like their fashion. They want their children to wear clothes neatly. When they were young, they judged the other person by his appearance. They also were asked to wear clothes which was in accordance with the occasion. In my opinion, this is still correct. However, people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind. If someone doesn't have enough knowledge about the event which he attends, even if he wears clothes neatly, he doesn't look like a gentleman. What I want to say is that people don't mind their clothes if he has enough knowledge about what he needs. To sum up, people can wear clothes more freely, in the future. What is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everthing including fashion. ",31.0
830," Dear Helen Ryan, It would be a great plessure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm. First of all, as a reply for your letter, I'd like to say, that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full-time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time. In July I can make an exception. According to accomodation I would prefer log cabins, as they are more comfortable and I like convenience. As to the list of activities I choose climbing and surfing. I like new challenges, even when I've never done them before, and I'm really looking forward to gaining this new kind of experience. If you don't mind I would like to ask you some vital questions. Do I have to take warm clothes? How much money would you recommend me to take? I would appreciate  if you send me a reply for my Questions as soon as possible Yours faithfully Tadeusz Ochman  [SEP]  ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable"". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who with  smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous. So, as a conlusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead. ",34.0
544," Dear Sir/Madam! Thank you very much for your letter. I was surprised because I didn't expect that I could win. Now I study and I'll continue my study untill the end of June. Then I'll have  holiday which finish in August. That's why I'd like to travel only in July. I prefer to live in  log cabin because I think it's more comfortable. There are warmer and drier and I'm afraid of insects and spiders. It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest  time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where  in the lake or swimming-pool. I think it's  very usefull and helpful thing for my health especially when I do it with pleasure. The second  my favorit sport is tennis. I've played tennis for ten years I'm a profesional and I have to be good at it, in any time. I want to ask you about money. How much money  I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card. Could you let me know about the weather because I don't know what kind of clothes I should take. Would you send me your answer as fast as it  possible. I look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you Yours faithfully Katerina Petrov  [SEP]  Hi, Kim! How are you? I'm fine soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward for them but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot. Now I want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advices about suits and dresses. Often we looked repetitions and if something didn't like us we tried to correct it. The most enjoable thing was to smart people. We have a good and rich sponsor, that's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style. We always explained  them and at the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loud  audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. You should try it and feel. I'll be waiting for your answer. Best wishes. Katerina. ",24.0
588," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I am very pleased about the prize I just won in your competition. Thank you for choosing me. Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement. First of all, I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July. As my family's new restaurant is about to open in August, I need to help with the restaurant, which is expected to be rather busy. Secondly, I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp. I had  bad experience last time I lived in a tent. I was terribly attacked by a been and it still gives me nightmares! As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating to challenge  waves. I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future. In addition what kind of clothes shall I bring with me? How much money is  appropriate to carry? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready? That was a pop concert of Steps in  M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean. A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform  other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to  other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well. I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying ""thank-you"" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene. All in all, it was a once-a-lifetime experience. Yours, ",38.0
254," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow  musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night. Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even  it was stated in your advertisement , but the main role was played by an unknown actor. Secondly, I had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up. Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount, even that your advertisement promised them. To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs. As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one during my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to pay the address above. Yours faithfully, Katja Menan.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Almost everyone is trying to be fashionable and look modern. Every season we can see  arrival of new styles, fabrics and proportions. Let's try to imagine, what will clothes be like 100 years from now? I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be  mixture of styles from different times of the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. A new technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colour during the day. In the future people will be even more concerned with pollutions and harmful UV-rays. So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy. With so many choices shopping for clothes is going to be even greater fun than it is now. Fashion of the future will not be the same as today's, but it will be more exciting and fun! ",33.0

I will do  F.C.E in  University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school. I prefer my accommodation at Camp in tents because it reminds me  my first school. It was great. But the way, I do not like to stay alone. I would like to have lots of people near me. Among those activities that you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes about them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is my challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it. I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend. I want to know if I can take my celular phone, too. Sincerely MARGARET BORNETE GOODS  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Women love shopping. I am a woman then I love it a lot. All weekends I and my boyfriend go to  B.H Shopping Center. I live in Site Belo and he lives near  B.H. Shopping Center. I retired four years ago and my live is very bored. When I am very sad I like to buy something and sometimes it makes me happy. I bought a lot of shoes, clothes and books last week. He was with me and suddenly he became very angry. He told me that I was very stupid. I tried to buy a handsome suit for him but he shouted and abandoned me with my bags. I took a cab and went to my house. I cried very much because my life is really very stupid. I decided to stop buying those things that I don't really need. I intend to continue studying and return to work because when our life is empty everything looks ugly and sad. I know in deep of my heart sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. But I am a woman. We are different. We need different things than men. Yesterday he called me and told me that he loves me, anyway. I believe him because he is a great man. I hope that he forgets  my shopping. And I decided I will go shopping alone. At last I am really a great woman and I love myself. ",30.0
195," Dear Sir/Madam I want to complain about your advertisment about the theatre 'Over the Rainbow' I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show, but he wasn't. Secondly the show didn't start until 20:15 but it should have started  19:30 so we had to sit and wait which was very boring. There were no discounts on the ticket available either. After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed because rebuilding. In the advertisement it says ""your perfect evening out"" but it was a real disappointment. I would like to have the money back that I spent on the tickets I bought. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours Faithfully Svetlana  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She had always been like that, said my best friend Ann to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret yesterday. The secret was that I was in love with Peter in my course. I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone. Yesterday when I arrived to the college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strange at me and laufhing. I felt how I started to blush. In the classroom it became even worser. People started to whrite things on the board and pointing at me.

What about the available discounts. They were not exist. Except of this there  more. After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed, because the chef of the restaurant was ill.

I did not expect these problems from you. I am waiting  your answer as soon as possible. Yours faithfully   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day Brian, the best friend of Pat told him a secret. An important secret for Brian. He told him, that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth the best friend of Jane. He didn't told  the secret because he wanted to heard Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very shame to ask Jane  in  date. So, Beth, asked Jane if she is in love with Brian and she said that she was. When Pat heart the good news he told to Brian to asked her  in  date and he knew that she will accepted. Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him. Jane and Brian were very happy. Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",24.0
469," Dear Sirs, I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow. On Saturday, June 5th, 2000 my wife and I wanted to spend a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical. When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as  mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones. After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated. So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink. To make the matters worse Danny Brook who was announced as one of the starring person in the musical was not acting this evening. You can imagine how disappointed we were especially  the acting of Danny Brook was the main reason for us  to see the musical. On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities. As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it wasn't a perfect evening out I would like to have 50% of the prize of the tickets back. I am looking forward to your promt reply. yours faithfully, Heine Bitz  [SEP]  What would we wear in 100 years time? Fashion will always be an interesting and important subject for all ages. Today the fashion industrie has a great importance in the commercial market. In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but the fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way. Firstly, the material of which clothes are made has  a wide range. There are the natural material on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produce more and more syntetical clothes, which relay on the production cost. In 100 years most of the clothes are made from syntetical material. Beyond  colours will play an important role in the next century for the fashion. Light and bright colours will be very common. Especially contrast will be attractiv. Furthermore the style of the clothes are going to be more crazy and individuell but there will be still enumerous clothes for the solid people. One balance fashion in 100 years time will be confortable and colourful. The fashion industry will deliver a wide range of vararity in style, material and colour. There will be clothes for everyones tast. ",30.0
155," Dear Manager, Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"" and I was really disillusioned. In the advertisement, it was told that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing. I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance at him. Also, in the schedule, the time of the show was written as 19:30, but it started at 20;15 and, I missed the dinner I was going to have with my best friend in London. Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill gates, I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets; but I had to give the exact price of the ticket, which I consider  as a fault of your theatre. In addition to these, it was mentioned that your restaurant was open after the show, but it was not because there was no food to be served. As you can understand, it was a dreadful time and I went my money back as a solace for the dissapointment I had. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGY AND MY DAILY LIFE In my daily life, I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier to live. However, I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships. Until 1996, I used to go to school on foot or by public bus; but since 1996; I take the underground to go to school. It is much quicker, and I do not have to wake up very early in order not to be late. Also, I use my computer and  Internet very much in order to reach some information, do my projects and communicate with my friends. To talk to a friend from another city or country instantly online is really nice and exciting. I do not have to wait for a letter for days and I gain so much time again. on the other hand, because of dealing with computers so much, I can not see my family and friends very much, even when we are at the same medium. It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker. But despite this, I am very happy with the facilities of technology in my daily life. ",36.0

The group has been booked into a comfortabel and well situatet hotel, whose name is  ,,Palace Hotel"".

You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoon. Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but some thing  specially is our cathedrale. The architecture bring you back into the old time.  as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing. We have also an interesting museum and a modern theatre. Finally, I am sure you and your group will spent some funny realaxing days . Please do not hesitate to contact me for some more information. I look forward to meeting each other soon. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Inventions have affected all our lives! What is it what we use every day  many hours? Sometime's  early in the morning until late in the evening. Yes it is the TV. It is well know in almost all family,  often with a lot of different cannels. First of all, the TV can tell us news in a short time,  what happened all over the world. Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is, that they telling about interesting reports, for instance about animals or  different culture from other countrys. Furthermore they have a lot of different programme, usually something for everybody. It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work. Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can watching the weather  and all of them were present in wonderful colour. To sum up, in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention. However, they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children. I can not imagine to live without televison, it is something what we need for our education,  for getting news and other helpful information. ",26.00

511," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my great disappointment about the musical show I attended in your theatre last weekend. According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisinggly, it  was proformed by a different actor  who I even didn't know the name. In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half  hour later, until 20:15. To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no any discount available. The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night. You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening. I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on  some money back. I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Nowadays, we use a lot of modern technology both at home and   office but it has its aventage and disaventage. The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier, for instance  ricer cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch  on, it makes cooking more effeciently. Furthmore, we can use  computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want. It is often suggested that, modern technology makes the gap bigger between peoples, they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings. To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not alway rely on it. ",24.0
355," Sir Manager, My name is Sandre Atos, I am writting to you because this last weekend I went to the theatre, you manage, to see what was called ""London's newest and best musical show"". However, I must say, it was quite the opposite. First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced for a disappointing actor. Besides  the spectacle was setted up to   19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe in that, everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud. I was told that I would have a perfect evening, though instead of that I had a terrible one. That's why I am writting to ask for some money back, I believe I have this right.  [SEP]  Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing  could ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day  television came to my house, I was only seven, everybody was exciting about the new ""toy"", however what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned  to rule our lives. Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights, playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to science development, I am getting better, recovering from ahsma. In addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat, thanks for the microwaves invention. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological facilities, but a very happy and united family. ",30.0
15," Dear Mrs. Jane Clark, Recently I was at the annual international arts festival, that you organized. I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving  a possibility to know more about modern art. I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries. Unfortunately, only six countries were represented this year at the festival, but I hope that soon there would be much more of them. I extremely liked all  concerts, shows,  exhibitions, but why there weren't any photograph exhibitions? I think, you should make some next year. Then, I want to mark, that  concert halls were too small, that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts. Then, I want to say, that  plays and films were exellent, but it wasn't enough of them for me. May be you should make more next year? And at the end, my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea, because you don't have to stay in queues to buy a ticket for a show, you want to go to. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Lucia, I was very pleased to receive your letter. You asked, if there are some school rules in my country. As you know, I'm studying at the private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes. I'll give you an example. In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke. The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars. So nobody smokes there. I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule. But some of my friends really would like to change it. You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home. Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends. The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day. I hope it was interesting for you to know about the rules in my life. Look forward to hearing from you, ",29.00

Firstly, I would like to go to California in June if his is possible because I will have finished my course in Merton college at the end of June. Secondly, I would prefer to staying in a tent rather than staying in a log cabin in order to have  experience, which I haven't had before. I am very knee on swimming and playing tennis so that I have had a part-time job in a sports centre in the evenings. I also have qualifications to teach them. In addition to all this, I would appriciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the travel. I look forward to hearing from you.

The aim of this report is to describe our English classes in Merton College and suggest that what we should film for making a short video. Speaking class should be filmed. It is suggested that speaking classes should be filmed the reason why is that the more students tend to attend. Another reason is that it will be more useful for forigen students who want to speak English. A number of forigen students have recently been increasing. School trips It is also thought that school trips are to be filmed because it is a wide range of interesting places available. It is believed that  one of the most popular activities in Merton College. Conclusion To sum up, it is recommened that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed. ",23.0
1124," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising a good programme for us. All of my classmates are expecting to go to London. I am satisfied with your programme. However I would like to suggest a good idea as a representative of our class. We have just sen the advertisement for 'The London fashion and Leisure Show'. The show include the latest fashions, sports wears and make up. We are very keen on the fashions and make up. Moreover, the admittion fee is free for students. It would be a great opportunity to study the latest fashion trend. It is held at the 'Central Exhibition Hall' on 14 March., from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Therefore we could go there after the Science Museum. If some students want a  shopping, they could go on 15 March. Because we have a free time on 15 March  afternoon. I hope you will consider my suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'A robot wakes me up at 7 A.M. every morning. I am served breakfast with fresh coffee. Washing and cleaning have been already done by my robot maid! Everybody might dream about this kind of situation. It would be come true in the near future. Our robot maid will do all of  house work instead of  human. In addition to this you will be able to control all part of  house by a computer such as temperature or vacume cleaning. However, this robot can not replace of mother or wife. They can clean the house but they can not give the affection to the family. Children need parents love and support all the time. To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives would be more convenience. But these robots can not be replaced of  warm-heart human. ",25.00
715," Dear Helene Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am glad to know that I have won first prize in your competition. Now, I am writing to you to ask  some details about these two weeks at Camp California and giving  some answers to your questions. First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am in holidays. About the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  tents as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club for five years and earned a few competitions. Secondly, I am very interesting in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time each other. We had a lot of fun during our last holidays and we took a lot of pictures. As the instructions about clothes and money were not enclosed in your letter, I request about it and ask you to include in it. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A lot of people like doing shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes  is not always enjoyable. And nowadays people must do shopping either they like it or not. For people who used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and  they are always looking for fashioned-clothes. But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like  the sales period, I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring. In my opinion, I think people have to do shopping even though they don't appreciate it very much. If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people. And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety. ",28.0
318," Dear Sir or madam For weeks I've been planing to go to this threatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster has all of us. To begin with on your advertisment you say that Danny Brooks will be starring  the show but instead their was a different actor which made us very disappointed. Another thing that is written on the advertisment is that the night show will start at 7:30 but instead of that their was  forty five minute delay The crowded got really upset and we were going to leave with the first chanse we had To make matters worse the restaurant of the theatre was closed. You can understand how that made me feel, and when the tickets had no discount To top of it all, this wasn't the perfect evening out. It was the worst night of my life. So I expect nothing less than a full refund of the money I paid to see this so called show. If you don't do as I say an article in the biggest newspaper will deffenetly change your ming Yours sincerely  [SEP]  What are going to look the clothes  in a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to have colours, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxershorts? This is something that has trabled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry. Fashion has made a big progress since the ealary beggining of the world. The variety of new fabrics,  colours and quality,  make new fashions statements every day. Although the clothes are getting more and more smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashing  the women to wear only skirts. Long ones actually and  men to wear trousers. In the sixties people worn clothes with flowers, big glasses,  jeans, and men should have had long painted hair. Nowdays women were really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pearce their bodys just like girls do. and the other way around. If this continues the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (;practically people won't be wearing any clothes) People will were extreme. Clothes which will be really Lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but nowone wears them. ",24.0

This technologic improvement is changing people's lifes, behaviours even their homes. Can you imagine? What people's homes will it be like in fifty years time? I guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier. Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no. Of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but otherwise we will get lazy, we will lose our abilities that we have now. Now IT (information technology) is in our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order from to  computer and someone will bring . It means we'll lose our social lifes. But we can't stop to  technologic improvement. We should use it in positif ways. When people use to the technology they should know that  is not everything. They should seek to other lifes outside their homes. I guess that with technology people will spend their life much more in their homes. It doesn't seem to me alright. Our homes should just protect us  dangeres from outside. But I believe human will never forget what they used to be. Mankind has been always seeking different things. We'are learning a lot of things about life. and we are practicing these . In the future life will be more artifitual than I had been before. Probably our homes will be smaller than now. Because  human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay  big cities (like London, New York, Paris). It means there will be too many people in small areas. Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all. That areas will just use for agriculture. Beyond the near future may be our homes will be  outer space it will be a spaceship. We'll travel around to space. It is just an imagination. We live in  changeable world. Like everything our homes will change as well. ",25.00
131," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show, which I have seen in your theatre, in London during my holiday. According to the advertisement, which appeared in one of the London's newspapers, I would like to present you  some of my complaines about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you ""offered"" has been changed. The man who played the main male role was different than this one, who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start has been changed, making your show delayed for nearlly one hour! In your offer I noticed an information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another ""defect"" in the advertisement was an ""invitation"" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown for me reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information telling about a cause of closing it). Finally, you guaranteed ""a perfect evening out"", but for me it was the worst visit in  theatre in two years time. To sum up, I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre. Neither  beautiful surranding near your theatre nor  comfortable sits will not recompansate  my horrible evening. Therefore, I would like you to send my money back, because I think I deserve it as a viewer. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology is very important in our life. Mainly, because it makes it easier and more comfortable. Nevertheless it has some advantages and drawbacks. In my opinion my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet her ""at every corner"": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my life-style for  better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done,  washing machine which makes my clothes clean again. Recently, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers,  internet, super-fast cars etc. These improvements helps me with my ordinary dutes. I can do my homework on  computer, prepare for the class test by searching  information in  Internet and use a mobile phone every time when I want to connect with one of my parents. However, technology has a bad influence on us, generally on our healf. Couple of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones make a possibility of getting sick with cancer. Also fast and well-improved car increase a risk of pollution of our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents. In conclusion I think that modern technology makes our life easier, nevertheless, we should avoid any possible risks connected with these improvements. Then we will be able to say that technology is something we should be proud of. ",29.0
592," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I was very pleased to learn that I had won the first prize in your competition! To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only on July, as it is the only moment when I can take my holidays. I'd prefer to sleep in tents rather than log cabins: sleeping in tents seems to correspond to a ""spirit of adventure"" to me, what I particularly like; in the opposite, log cabins are more ""traditional"" and a less interesting experience. I'm very interested in basketball and sailing, which are both team activities. As I was a child, I was very good at basketball, even one of the best of my class. I like playing in  team and deciding quickly what to do next. These reasons are why I'd also like  sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospherical conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need. I think you very much in advance for your kind assistance. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make a pleasure to the buyer and for that reason, will be enjoyable. But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try . When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing. Hopeful, you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size. Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes. So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you do as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest! ",32.0

During that time I can talk  some secret things or private with class-mates. After that we know each other more than before. In addition speaking activity include everything  to learn English such as listening, speaking,  grammer as well. Other lesson, the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammer, English culture... etc. It might be good. However all  students are passive. So it can be boring. give a topic and then discussion about it. I know that what my friends think and like. It is real life who we are. Also the film must be funny. If a film is boring, nobody will see it. During speaking, there are lots of  happening such as, some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture. Having fun and knowing new knowledge. It makes us laugh. So I think that speaking activity should be filmed as you can see and know  real us and  funny as well. ",18.0

For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a ""must"". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone. To sum up, I would like to say that for to have an exciting shopping , you have sometimes to plan it or just be in the right mood. ",32.0
614," Dear Helen Ryan I'm writing back to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me. If it's possible I would like to travel on July because of my job. I can't leave it until this month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of the year. As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer. I would like to stay in a tent because I'm used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too. It's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer. It's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography. I have never done noon of them before and as a result I can't be good  but I've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie. I also think that it would be great to learn  photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures. If you don't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the weather of California. And also may I have to bring  money? because I know that all the costs are paid but it could be necessary for other things. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely Luna Juarez.  [SEP]  I completely agree with the following statement: ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" From my point of view a lot of people believe that it's very fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true but in my opinion go shopping can be stressing and disgusting. First of all we usually go to the shops at the same time than the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled and it's impossible to try acurately. Secondly you have to thank before you come in a shop if you're going to have  luck. I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy. Thirdly you have to pray  to find the right size and once you've got it you have to think Does it fits me? And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a big amount of money or you will end  stressed, disgusted, and depressed. At last but not at least let me give you some advice try not to go with that friend of yours that is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will be awful. ",32.0
255," Mr. Maneger, In this unconfortable situation I am writting to tell you about some irratable problems. I went today to see Over the Rainbow, and I am very disappointed with the organisation of your theatre. First of all, when I went to buy my tickets I discovered that the advertisement was saying false things because there wasn't any discount available, but in anyway I bought the ticket. Then, the time marked to the beginning  was 19:30 and unfortunatly he began at 20:15. I have already, saw others versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, who ended with the musical. Closing this facts, when the musical finished I was very , in the fact of the wainting for the start of the musical and  dissapointed with this version of Over the Rainbow, every body went to the restaurant wich is closed without any explanation. I am very dissapointed with this evening and with the desorganized way of deal with problems so I am asking  my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He has a bestfriend, that was more like a brother for him. They always done thing together, and they were the most popular boys in school, both were very hanson, played football they were the example for everybody. Before one day, when Pat discovered that his brother was gay, after this their relationship has change. Pat was very frightened with this situation. Pat and Ted, had always competition, and Ted used to be the best, he never had failed and people in general constums to like more Ted, I don't now why. This secret was an opportunity for Pat be the best without  competition but it is a secret who involved his best friend sexuality, and if Ted was a normal person it will be fine but he was the example for all  school. Unable to keep a secret he told for everyone, ended his friendship with Ted, now Ted is rejective for everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honestity. I  prefer be nothing than bun like Pat ",20.0
1021," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing, on the name of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you give us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications in the programme. The programme you has already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination between cultural visits and more relaxed activities. But, in another hand, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which includes a range of different stands. The only day we can attend to this show is the Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall. We are really interested in visiting this unhabitual show and the main advantage is that the entry is free for students. In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly after the Science Museum to the show. We all agree that we have enough time in Wednesday for shopping. I hope that you will agree with this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time Famous people have always been the center of interest for  number of people. Their wedding, their holiday, their new haircut and so on. But do we think enough about the right to have a private life? We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do politics or  movies! But from the other, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities. In conclusion, I would say that both parts, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules. As public people, stars and politicians have to accord some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful. ",31.00
776," Dir Madam I'm writing to you in reply to your letter. I was really suprised when I opened it. I look forword to going to the Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me on August and I will have to look after them. I prefer staying in tens to staying in log cabins. Because it remainds me  my childhood. I used to going with my friends to the camp, wich was situeded on a seaside. We had always enjoying ourselves. Never had I got such a great time. From your's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing. I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport. I find it very atractive. I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old. However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport. For me it is only a hobby. Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport. I would like to ask what kinds of clothes should I take with me. and I wonder if prizes are high there. Yours faithfully Angelina  [SEP]  I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want. It isn't true. Nowdays we have many big shopping centers. We like them because everything is on one place. The most suitable time for shopping is  weekand when parents don't work and children haven't got a school. Because of that shopping centers are over crowded. You can't buy something in  peacful and calm athmospher. In addition in such kind of shops prizes are very high, of course not all of them. However such centers are very useful and necessary. I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is  extremly hugh queu to the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable. If you bought something goregous, you would be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have  bad mood don't go shopping. ",26.0

You asked me about some further information. First, I'd like to travel on July at any time from the first to the 30st because of my vacation period. I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare me. Second, I'd prefer have a log cabin where I could let some stuff. Finaly, I'd like to practice tennis and to try climbing. Is there any ability required? Could you send me a note about travelling in California which could help me? Yours sincerely Bernard Moreau  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea This book stays one of the best  american litterature book. It is classified as one of the ten books that should figure in your own library. But it is also the most famous short story from Ernest Hemingway. Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it allows a deep reflexion about oldness. A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that. Then, Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man. The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful, faithful way that it callas a though about life and death. I recommand this book a lot  both to discover Hemingway and american litterature. ",22.0
226," Dear Madam or Sir, During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the ""Circle Theatre"". The show was called ""Over the rainbow"" and should be, in refer to the advertisment, London's newest and best musical show. But I was very disappointed. I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisment were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook to someone else I was very disappointed. Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should  begun at 19:30 but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you have mentioned some discounts in your advertisment, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student. Even your theatre restaurant was closed for repairs. The perfect evening you promised in your advertisment was the complete opposite and that is what I want to get some money back from you. I am looking forward to an early answer. Yours faithfully Herman Ruter  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I have been friends for a long time. We have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests. When we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent. I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know  that. Pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose. Two days later my father asked me whether I had thought at any time  to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard  that from some parents of my friends at school. He told me  two hours what could happen if I would do that. I was very surprised because Pat and I were along when we decided to do that. The next day Pat told me that he wanted to be admired by some girls and so he had to tell them our secret. I felt very disappointed in this moment but I have learned something new about humans;  is  you can only trust yourself. Pat and I have still been good friends but we have never had an other secret together. ",30.0
860," 13, June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to stay in the Camp California Secondly, I will be able to travel on July because I am a manager so I can not travel another time. Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I can not sleep on the floor. I would like to sing and  photograph, I've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it. In the other hand, I can not sing very well but I would like to do this  there. I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there, would you check the weather forecast for me, please? And how much money I am going to need to have there with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely. Maria Sophia Candoso.  [SEP]  the lost wallet A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first pay and went to a shopping center to spend my money with my credit card. I bought everything I wanted. Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money? I started to look in everywhere. I've asked my mom and my friends and everybody didn't know where it was. My mom said: 'You've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.' I started to look for my wallet and I couldn't find it, lighter. Now I was without my money and my wallet. What could I do? Suddenly the door bell rang. I went to see who was there. It was and old woman asking who was Maria. 'It's me!' I said. That's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the sit of the eating-place of the shopping center that I went  that day! ",25.0
1081," 12th December 2000 Dear Mister Robertson, The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm, which you have organised for our trip to London. The reason why I'm writting to you is the class and I have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 am - 19.00 p.m. It is a show about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all are interested in fashions and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for as because students have not to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour. I would like to suggest  you how the programm could be changed. Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wedensday afternoon in our free time. What are you thinking about this suggesten? I hope you will unterstand this kind of matter and the class and I  looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot. First point  we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or  internet. In the future they both getting closer and closer. That means for exampel while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or chees. Or never living the office you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath. So in fact people's home became more confienence and comfortabler. I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furnitures of people's home will not change as well. ",21.00
983," 20 Ibiza Road San Antonio 13/06/2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam: I'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition. First of all I'd like to thank you for the prize, I will enjoy it abosolutly. Your letter encloses an application  I have to fill  with some information for the travel. Well, as you demand, I  tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins, I'm going to be able only  this summer month because  my job responsabilities. Acording to the choice whether I prefer tends or log cabins, I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping the nearest to nature, if it's possible in front of a lake or a river, if you camping has one, so that I will be able to practise my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing. As well as this one I'll take painting, I'm very keen on art and I think I'm good at making portraits. Finally, I'd like to add some further questions: what kind of clothes do I have to bring?, Do I any kind?, and Would it be necessary to bring  money?, how much? Thank you very much, and I hope the information above would be sufficient. I look forward to hearing from you Your faithfully Jose Fernandez  [SEP]  ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than  others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners. It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering  the revenge that Heathcliff  swear,  cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but  the others character make him become thus. This revenge links the story  so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.

205," Sir, I have seen your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" in London. I have been very disappointed when I had read your advertisement, I was keen on your show, but I have not seen the same show, I have seen one which it looked like, but not be . First of all I have been attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who played effectly that evening. This actors appeared with fourty-five minutes later refering which is written on your advertisement. This late forbid me   to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing! For all this reasons I do wish that I would not have been gone see that show, for which the tickets were not available. And as a conclusion I want you to give me my money back, (I have still the advertisement if you want the prooth  what I say). You have the choice, either you make what I want, or I attack you in justice. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  ""The old man and the sea"" E.H. When I have read this book, I have been fascinated by the will of the old fisher. This will is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance  to meet someone who could help him. But I don't think he would want to. He doen't want  because he wants to prove  the little  and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big age. I think this are the reasons of his will. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumph othe  fish because of his knowledge of the sea but  principally because he has known research in the deeper of his mind. To conclude I think the difficults situations allow us to discover ourself getting out of ourself. ",23.0
240," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week. I feel disappointed because it was different to  the advertisement. First of all, the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there were two unknown actors in the show. I feel most disappointed about this. The show was started at 20.15 but actually it should  started at 19.30. Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned  discount is available. And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed because at that day was their day-off. But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you know it would be closed. I am afraid it was not a best musical show because all the things above was not an accurate as what we had been told. On the whole, I feel disappointed about the event and I would  have my money back. I look forward to hearing your reply. Thank you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I say this because of the experience I've had from her. Actually, we were quite good friends before the event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year. She is sitting next to me, we started to chat more and more, then we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually. Suddenly my heart was thumbing so quickly because I saw him? - A boy who is a new student. I know this is one right love, I'm absolutely besorrted of him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossip behind me then everyone would know I fancy him. But the thing which I've never expected is Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always make  joke on it, that makes me feel so embarrised: I was very angry at that time! Now, I don't talk to her anymore because I can't stand a person who I trusted betrayed me. I hope she would know that  was her fault and don't do it anymore. ",21.0
125," Lausanne, the 20th of May 2000 Dear M. Smith, My name is Marie Bouchard, I come from Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend. On Thursday, the 3rd of May 2000, we went to your theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"". Unfortunately, we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre. Firstly, we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts as it's written on your advertisement . Surprisily, there were no discounds. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!! Thirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement? In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!! Nothing was serious. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful. I sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back. In advance, thank you. I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre. Sincerely yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When her best friend, Scala, asked her  an idea to surprise her husband  because she's pregnant, Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala's husband got the surprise. The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village. She's a secretary in an office. Everybody knows everybody. Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husband  too. It was a Friday suny afternoon, Scala was really excited  to tell her the new. Despite  she knew that Pat couldn't keep  secret but for this time she was confident  maybe too. Just after Scala told her the new, Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery, to tell  that Scala is pregnant. As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came & bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said ""Congratulations for the new baby."" He was so amazed and asked  to repeat . She just thought it would be a secret,  she came really embarassed. When he went back to his house, his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it wasn't a surprise! Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret. ",25.0
1092," Dear Mr Robertson My name is Gabriel and I represented our class. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would particularly like to go to the show. As representant of my class may I kindly ask you to change partially your plan during our visit in London. The Monday 13 March would be fine. The morning  visiting interesting places in the City and on the afternoon  make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent. Because the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday, I would suggest to change your plan. There is a very interesting programme for young people like we. There will shown the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear,  several additional attractions. It will be beutiful if you would agree to change your plan. The last day, the Wednesday 15 March will surely  very interesting because the National Art Gallery is  very famous place in London. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it., It happened on a very lovly day in summer. The sun was shining, the Chanel was clear blue and I was walking by the Sea. Suddenly I heart somebody crying for the help. Not studying for too much I ran as fast as I could direct  there I heart the voice . I knew, I can't swimm then I realized it might be dangerous for me as well. But in this particular moment it wasn't important for me. The most important things was a little boy  about ten years old, who was in the watter without  parents and couldn't swimm. It was diffucult for me because I am afraid of watter. Although I went quickly to him and took him on my hands. He was exhaused and couldn't breath. In the meantime a man told me he were a doctor and could help the boy. I was very happy that I managed to save the live of the boy. Now, when I consider about the events it's clear for me that if I got  a few minutes later  probably would be to late. You should ignore the dangerous if you  convince you can save somebody his live. ",26.00
1031," Dear Mr. Robertson, I was asked by my class to write to you. First of all, we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three days trip to London. Indeed, we are especially interested in the sightseeing  by bus. The river trip to Greenwich is also a marvellous idea! Moreover, we couldn't go there without visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. However, could we make a suggestion? Having seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th, we would particularly like to go and visit it. How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for it! Besides, as there are more girls than boys in the class, they would certainly enjoy attending on live make-up and hairstyles. Lastly, it is free for students, which is fantastic! So, instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, we might go to the Show. We may go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, as we should have had  freetime. What do you think of this suggestion? We are looking forward to receiving your reply. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  For famous people, having a private life is difficult, especially because we are all interested in their lives. On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television. On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what we often forget they are.  ",40.00

This book help us to impove our logic, mind,  memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, be more honest with other people and pay attention for the smallest details in our life because sometimes it can help us very very much. So I hope I could help you. Write  me as soon as you can. With best wishes, your ",28.00
612," Dear Helen Ryan I've just received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in your competition  2 weeks at Camp California in the USA. I am very glad to hear that and would like to tell you all the informations you need to know from me. I would be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be long enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go on other holidays because for  Easter holiday I need to attend  Tennis competition in the name of my school and we need time to practise. In  Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going to a ferry trip with my relatives. That are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other times. I do appologize about that. I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I say before that I have to attend  tennis competition so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9, now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county player  I was 12. I attended 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad influences me to play tennis and  enjoy it. For climbing, I started to be interested in it since it was 14. My family live near the sea so we have got quite a lot of chance to go climbing. I'm not scared of height and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me. I would like to ask you a few questions. How hot is it in California in July? so I know what kind of clothes I need. Do I need a lot of money, will we have time for shopping. What kind of food do we eat? This is because I cannot eat Pork. If there is any unconvenience, please feel free to tell me. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim How are you? I am sorry that I didn't write any letter to your during  last month. I really wish you were with me last month. Quess what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that happened at my school. That's why I have no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it! As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say ""yes"" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in  drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television. The preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing  concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing  stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like? It was good fun though! , but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do. At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition make me to try to work very hard and this term I get A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now I have my aim about what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder. I hope you will feel like me one day. I will write to you again soon and tell you how I  getting on. Lots of love ",25.0
1119," Dear Mr. Robertson, As we have seen the advertisment of the programmed the school set for us as a farewell activities, we are very appreciate and would like to thank  for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class which we hardly done it before. However, on the March 14, there is the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is also interesting for us. As you know all of us in this class are preparing to go in for the art & design school in the next semester. So this is a great oppotunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will have a fashion show, a demonstation from make up artists, and a contest for hair stylist. Furthermore, most of the famouse brand of sport were companies will join in this exhibition with their new product for the coming season. We would like to know if all of us can join in this event. We all agree that we are going to join the school trip to  Science Museum, which is the most interesting trip for us. Anyway, intstead of go shopping in the afternoon session, we will attend the show. This is the solution that we all think it will be the less effected to the other students, as the school do not need to re-arrange all the trip just because of our special interesting. We hope  much that you understand, and would like to thank  in advance for your cooperation. We looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I had never wanted to be a hero It was dangerous, but I know I had to do it. Even though all of my friends who were with me in that day all said ""Just let it go, it's just only a puppy. Why do you have to take a risk?"" It seemed that all of them didn't have any sympathy to that lovely blue eyes puppy that somebody who have no mercy just left it there, in a highway. If you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got off  the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side. It was true that small dog were in danger, but your life was in that situation as well once you decide to do that brave thing. All my body was shaking, and I would almost have turned back to my car if I didn't here that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner. So I just crossed the road, and jumped, picked him up. I feel like I was a hero at that moment, even though I'd never though of it before. ",24.00
360," Dear Sir or Madam, A few weeks ago, I went to London, and I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show, called ""Over the Rainbow."" I'm very sory to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening. First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I need some time to by the tickets, I by two tickets of £20 and when I ask for a discount, they didn't give it to me, then I keep waiting for the show to start untill 8:15 pm. Then when the show finally started I got very disappointed because, I really wanted to see Danny Brook, but instead of him there was any other actor. Lately when the show finished, I planed to go to the restorant and get some food, but I was close, because it was being repaired. I will be very thankfull if your could return  me half or some of my money, or even to make the corresponding discount. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell something to her, finally everyone knew about it. But this time it was something more important that any other time. I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling me little and terrible secret to Pat, everithing started going wrong, Katrin my friend, and the one I was being bad with, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really don't know what to do, I was in love with Brett, but I love my friend too. So I decide to talk to Brett. We both decided to finish with all this stupid affair. It was difficult, but I was the best for everyone. Then I decide to talk to Katrin, I was very sory of all I have do, so I apologize with her and promise her that this will never would happen again. Now I'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the hole world. ",23.0
1114," Dear Mr Robertson, On the behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose to us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of the English culture... However, we would like to suggest you something: A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which seems to be very attractive. Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there. Let me explain  you what it is: It must be an exhibition which takes place in the ""Central Exhibition Hall"" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different leisures, make up and so on... What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a ""Shopping-Afternoon"" - that we can even put on Wednesday during the free-time - so that  to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show... Please, Let us know. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The respect of Famous people's private life has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a ""public job"". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox: Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question... As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a ""public job""?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed! But to solve this problem, we may think first about its origin... ""Reading the gossips"": isn't it what anyone of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui in his privacy. Why not? To conclude, I would say that ""privacy"" and ""celebrity"" can't go together. It's just a matter of choice: being aware of that problem, everyone is free to become famous or not... ! ",32.00
345," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see your musical show called 'Over the rainbow'. It was actually very disappointing and I have to say that I want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and I rally do think it was not the perfect evening out. Here are the problems of your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late. The price of  ticket was another problem. Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available. I did not get  discount. I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show. I really do think you need to organise your show a bit more carefully so you do not make these mistakes in future and it will be kind of you if you give my money back. Yours faithfully Ring T Lun  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I believe that modern technology has changed a lot of people's daily life. My daily life also got affected by modern technology a lot. The modern technology which changed my daily life most is a personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course works in the computer. The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations in  shorter time. I can go on  internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones. I don't have to go to  library and read hundred's of books to find informations anymore. I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses and I don't have to go to football pitches to see how the players are playing. There are, of course some disadvantages. Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology. I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere. There are plenty of trains and buses. I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit. I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot. I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more. ",29.0
1074," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to your about the trip in London. Thanks for your programme, we are all looking forwards especially for the Monday 13 March because we will discover all the monument in London. However, we have got a suggestion: we saw an advertissement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00. For all of us, it sound like a great opportunity because we though that this event would makes us learn about the way of life in London,  the english style.... Moreover, the big advantage is that it is a free show so you will not have to worry about the budget. Our request is to change the programme, either you can cancel all the Tuesday and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you cannot cancel the Museum, we can go there right after because we will have full of time to  shopping during our free time on Wednesday.  Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very exciting. thanks in advance Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Since always, medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worst and worst, you can find everything in ""gossip"" Newspapers. Does famous people deserve to keep their own life secret? According to me, you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when  to start you career you know that  medias will be hunting you everywhere and  more famous you get  worst it is going to be because that  the life style people wants to know everything , for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they saw them many time on T.V. or   Cinema, So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself. therefore, even if I agree sometimes  Medias are going too far and write really bad things. if you're famous you cannot have  private life because all of this is a part of their job. And if  Medias are too awful they have got  law to protect themself. ",28.00
1130," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, thank you for your programme. It is very various and interesting. We all enjoy it. But last week we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. This presentation will show the latest fashions and the leisure and sports wear. We would be very interesting in seeing the english fashion. At this show we could see different new  make up and hairstyles. The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students. For pratical informations, this show start at 10.00 and close at 19.00. It will stay in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It is not too far and the openning hours fit us. About the programme, we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping. As far as we are concerned we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery. We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and  the afternoon, if some one of us is intersted, we could see the National Art Gallery. I hope you won't be too angry for this changing but we would all like to go to the show. Waiting for your answer, receive our greetings. For the class  [SEP]  General speaking, homes will change considerably. They will become less dark and more confortable than today.  People's homes will build more economically by using natural energies like solar or wind energy. This improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling energies. About the size of hous, I think that in cities houses will be more and more little because of the over population. We also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats. In opposite, in the suburb or in the land, more and more rich people will build big houses. Homes like this will be build with the latest technologies and  very luxurious. But about  differences between  rich's and poor's homes  will be the same in the futur. New technologies and facilities won't improve the relationship between people. I think that people will be as alone and julous as today. ",23.00
168," Dear Madam and Mister I am writing to you about your theatre: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It played an other one who played very bad. Secondly, the musical should start on 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happend  such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true? And finally, I would  had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I  go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how can it be, it was closed! This are too many negatives points for one evening. I am afraid, but I want my money back. I hope you do not disappoint my in this point. Your faithfully Pica Landen  [SEP]  'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a tabu  by me and my friends. We have discussed about it a lot of times. I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future. I have dout when somebody said, that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change the clothes and the fashion so much again. We have so many kind of clothes and fashion behind our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes moderner so that you can not walk in them anymore. Maybe in 500 years, some people will live on the Mars and then, they  have to wear other kind of clothes. But I don't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth. They just look funny! See you in your next life! ",21.0
524," Mr Smith, Spending a week in London for holidays last week, I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really disappointed evening! Indeed, firstly, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15). Then, the actors (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) who were mentioned  and supposed to play weren't present. There were different actors who took the role. Thus, the musical show wasn't as good as it should have been. I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited  to see them. Furthermore, on the advertisement I got,  was written that the theatre restaurant was opened. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe spend a better evening than  at the begining  but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were indicated. As you can notice, my perfect evening I had supposed, was a nightmare; that's why I would please  you to give  my money back because I cannot tolerate such a thing!  [SEP]  From the begining of the century to now, modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier. Indeed, the modernism helps us to lead a confortable and better life than before. For example, cars, planes are a wonderful invention! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go to a city to an other one or to travel abroad. People couldn't think of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created. Human being became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands. The communication has made many progresses too. Everyone gets a television at home. ""A machine which talks and shows pictures!"" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago. Although there are new machines etc, the health makes many discoverts thanks to the searching on different diseases in order to make the population lived older. Thus, the modern technology seems to be a positive way in order to improve our daily life. ",22.0
378," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' I've visited it last evening in your 'Circle Theatre'. By the way I would  enquire about  some money back. I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by visiting it. I believed in the phrase by which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect. The show should  started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very wrong and afraid about it and I remember that this was the third problem this evening. By arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there will come another problem. The problem came. The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show for eating something, was closed without any explaination and the perfect evening was completely unperfect. I think this are reasons enough for enquiring about  some money back. I would be gladly to get an answer from you. Faithfully, Bergut Hunrtner  [SEP]  What will we wear 100 years from now? Fashion changed every year. Do you remember what people wore 100 years ago? And by the way do you believe that they also thought the fashion never changed? But the fashion changed. 100 years ago the people wore long clothes and large robes. You can say they wore a lot of clothes at one time. Nowaday people wear lesser clothes. Often you causes very litte and short robes and tops. Often you show your skin because its popular  and everyone do it. So it's possible to wear nothing in the future. A lot of thinks will be easier to do. But in the winter there's still a problem which is to solve. In the winter you'll freeze. But this problem is solving by itselfes. The sommers and winters get warmer. The season for this is the global warming, which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible. But by some situations you have to wear something. The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special kind of producing. So don't laugh about this idea. Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it. It's possible. ",21.0
48," Dear Ms Clark, I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate  on the organization. I am also writting to make a suggestion and to give  my opinion for next's year festival. An internation arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were starts and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the possibility to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures. In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert, ""La Moldava"" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough, it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies. I am glad to tell you that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because also people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival. I would like to give a suggestion. I think that meeting writers, dancers, musicians and artists could be very interesting for anybody. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you very much for your recent letter. I'm very happy that you are well. When I read your letter I was surprised because I didn't know that you have so many rules both at school and at home. In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht. Nobody has to be late in the morning because it is important to respect  class mades and teachers' effort of getting up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour. There isn't a kind of punishment for people who do these things. My parents are very good. The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lays. It's important for them that I tell them where I'm going if I go out and what time I think of coming back home. I can do what I like doing but I have to study. This is the only condition  to do what I prefer. There isn't anything that I'd like to change. Write soon Love ",28.00

In your advertisement,  said that one of the actor was Danny Brook but it was a different actor. This was very disappointing and I believe that all the people there, were angry. The musical show must have been started at half past seven but it started at quarter past eight. About the tickets, I the advertisement said that discounts would be available but it would not. Also the theatre restaurant was closed and I do not know why. When I read the advertisement, it said that the restaurand would be opened. Lastly, I want to tell you that I had not  a perfect evening and I would be grateful if you could send me my money back. I am looking forward to your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my best friend. She lived next to my house and we went to the same school. I told her all my problems and I could rely on her. One day I heard my mother to tell my father that she want to divorce because she can't live with him any more. When I heard it, I went to my room and I was crying. I called Pat to come to my house because I was not very good and  to tell her what had happened. Few minutes later Pat came to my house and I told her that my parents are going to divorce. Pat did not believe me and she started to ask why. I told her that I did not know. She helped me to forget it for a few minutes, she made me to laugh and the she left. But before she left I begged her not to tell anybody. The other morning I went to school and all the students came next to me and told me not to be mad because of my parents. Then I realised that Pat told  my secret and I felt very angry, that's why I said at the beginning that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. ",28.0

I would prefer to be accomodated in  tents because I love camping but I don't mind also the second possibility. In your letter you wrote that I will I the chance to do two activities; First of all I would like to play tennis because I have been plaing for seven years, secondly I would like to attend a course of surf but I have just some elementary knowledge. I would like also to have more information about the cost and which kind of clothes you suggest  to bring with me. I am looking forward  your reply Your faithfully  [SEP]  First of all I would like to say that I think it is important to concentrate this video in   few but interesting part of our daily life at school Interesting will be to show how the lessons are organize, saing that we are never doing just one activitie during the class. We should speak about our library that it is well furnished of several books, tape and video. After that we have to make sure that we explain how is it the relationship betwen teachers and students, showing the several time that we have been out together. In addition I think  should be reported in this video some personal opinion about the school  asking students and teachers. Finaly we should give some information also about our courses concerning tourism, buisness and computer. ",26.0
863," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter with congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need. First of all, I would like to start with the time of the travelling. I would prefer to go to the Camp on July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August. As regards accomodation, I would rather choose staying in tents. That is because I am keen on hich-hicking and I amused to living in tents. It is quite romantic, I think. As to the activities offered I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not quite good at the last one. Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure. As regards swimming, it is my passion from the very childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now. In the conclusion I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information. I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me. I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzeled about what to wear there. Besides, I would like to know how much money will I need and which expensies will I have to pay for by myself. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely XAVA SURGANOVA  [SEP]  Subject: to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about  daily life of our school. Introduction. The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see  watching the short videofilm about the daily routine of our school. The Area Around the School: I have made a little survey on the subject of my report and I have elucidaded that most of the pupils of our school consider that the region and the area around school should be filmed first. Personally I agree with their statement and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school. We should film our gardens around  school and a pitch with the playgrounds for volley-ball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning. Classrooms, Lessons and Breaks. Next things to be shot, by the majority of students was said to be the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the decoration of our classrooms and  atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been made during the last  years and all  modern conveniences that were made for both students and teachers. And as regards breaks student consider them being a very important part of school life, despite all their mess and noise. Outdoor Activities And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities, which our student are provided with in our school. We can make some short shots about the school theatre and it's performances and also about the sport-clubs and their competitions and awards.

494," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called ""Over The Rainbow"" and ask for  money back. This show was presented by the Circle Theatre. First of all, the poster told me that this show was performed by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there was different actor. I am so disappointed. Secondly, the show was expected to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I have been waiting for 45 minuties. The poster also told me that I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show. As you know the show started late, so, I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed before the show has been finished. Thirdly, there was no discounts available but it was printed on the poster. If there was no discounts, don't write it on the poster. I got confused and  disappointed again. Finally, I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward for your prompt reply and improvement. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The world is changing every day. So, modern technology is needed to meet the requirement. In an every single day, many modern technology is produced and it really affects or changes our daily life. The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world's computers by some telephone liens. You can send a letter to your friend by an e-mail but not writting it on a piece of paper and send it by post. It just takes you a few minutes. How convenience it is! There are also much more advantages, you can buy somethings in a supermarket by only a mail order, you don't need to go out of your home. Other than the internet system, there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life. For example, we can go to the Mars and do some invesgation. So, we know much more about our universe. Some modern technology is also put into the transport system. For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster. The modern technology has changed our daily life. It aims at improving our standard of life and makes us live more comfortably. So I think the changes are good. ",21.0
284," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"", which was played in the ""Circle Theatre"", because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all I would like to say something about the starring: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard about. So the main point of my visit had dissappeared. Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later. A serious theatre can't miss  such an important thing, the starting-time. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was going to pay for the tickets, I found another thing : there were no discounts avaible. In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence. But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed, without  saying the reason. I had to go back to the hotel, because all  restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded. Summing up, you might have noticed that that wasn't ""my perfect evening out"" wich you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back. This might be the only way I keep on relying on your theatre. I hope I will receive an answer. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and because of this Pat caused a big, but stupid problem. It was late in the night, and Pat was thinking about something Nick had told her that afternoon: - ""Don't tell Marie I was here"". Nick was Marie's boyfriend, and Marie  a very good friend of hers. They were in the shopping centre, and the problem was that Nick wasn't alone, he was with a very beautiful girl. What could Pat do? That morning Marie had told her that Nick couldn't go to the cinema with her because he had a lot of work to do in the afternoon so.. what was he doing there with that girl? In the end Pat phoned Marie and told her: she was a very good friend. Marie was so shocked that, as soon as Pat had stopped speaking, she phoned Nick and, without letting him say anything, she broke up their relation. But the truth was very different, because what Nick was doing there was something which had nothing to be with what Pat had thought. Nick was there because the following Sunday would be a very special day for him: he would have been going out with Marie for three years, and he wanted to buy a present for her. But..what about the girl? She was his cousin! She works as a model, and she was advicing him about which clothes, etc,... buy for her. Pat couldn't keep that secret, and in spite of helping Marie, she made a couple disappear. ",30.0
718," Dear Helen, I have just received your letter which made me so happy and I am writing to apply  your questions. First of all, I can travel only  July because my son's school is going to finish at the end of June, so it is impossible for me to travel during on June. Apart from that I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year so July is the best choice for me. I would rather stay in  tents because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family. I have always loved camping. My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it. I have been taking photographs since I was 17. I took some lessons and after that I have really improved it. Beside this, I am very good at playing basketball. I used to play in  high school's team. Also, I have some questions. I have never been to California before so I have no idea about the climate. Could you please give me some information about it and what kind of clothes should I bring for my holiday. Besides, I really would like to know, approxiametely how much money should I take with me? Is it an expensive city? I hope all those information will help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am so sorry that I couldn't write  you last week. As you know, I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked  as a director's assistant during the last week. First of all, it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer's name before who is called Tina. As a director's assistant my job was  arrangement of the audience's seats and tickets. All seats were brought from a sponsor company. Everyday I worked for two hours in a shop to sale tickets. It was quite enjoyable because everyday I met different people who like listening the  pop music so we had lots of things to talk about. I also helped  the singer's some special demands which weren't so difficult to do. She was very nice and friendly. At the concert night, I worked as well. After the concert I was absolutely exhausted but the thing is I will never forget this experience. I met lots of people who were very famous. The best thing was of course  Tina. We promised each other to keep in touch and she has invited me  her next concert! So, my news are finished. Write me back soon. Love from, ",32.0
457," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to the musical show I saw last week in your theatre. I hoped that it would be the most excited evening during my week's holiday in London. Unfortunately it wasn't. I wouldn't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information. First of all, when I had bought the ticets it appeared that there is no discount available. Secondly, I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone didn't excuse. Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook, which is my favourite actor, didn't play in the show. Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed. Finally, I must say that I had a very disappointing evening and I would like to get my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I wish I had know it two days ago... Exacly on 15th June we were at the birthday party. Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him. I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea. I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin. It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was stearing at us. Yesterday I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony. I really regret that I was so foolish. The most horrible  is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I don't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties. ",33.0
1052," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have heard you organised such a nice programme especially  river trip and museum for our class. I would like to thank you for doing that on behalf of my classmates. By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show. It will show us the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear. In addition, make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time. We think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience. What is  better,  all students can participate without paying. It takes place at Central Exhibition hall in London. And it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of March. So we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on Tuesday instead of  Science Museum and put  science museum into free time on Wednesday. I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Much safer but still at home Our homes have change with many comfortable things compare with the past. As many inventors made lots of things, we can live in good facilites houses: But do you think no more comfortable homes will be built? Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security safety like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That is, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place. To conclude, while our homes in the future will be much safer than before, they will still have good spaces for us to be at home. ",25.00
836," DEAR MS. RYAN,  IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT. I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE WONNER OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH. IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA, WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE. ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME, ACCOMMODATION'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO. ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY. THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER. WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY. CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING (ASPECIALLY IN POLAND, WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS, MOTORS OR COMPUTERS. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST). BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR  BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION. PEOPLE, WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD  BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE). ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE. EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY). BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT. IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE-STYLE, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS. ",27.0
633," Dear Ms, I have just received your letter which inform me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA. In this letter you ask me  some further information for my conveniance for this trip. Firstly, I can take my holiday only  the two first week of july because of my work. Secondly, I would prefer sleep in a tent. I am going every year camping in the countryside of France. The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing. I have never sailed but I am a well swimmer. Last summer I took a course of one week in Switzerland of climbing so I have good knowledge of this sport. Finally could you please tell me wich kind of clothes shall I take with me and if the camping furnitures are provided. I  also wondering me how much money I need and if there is a safe place where I can put my money and passport. I look forward to earing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful. Yours sincerely Laura Demoriane  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on saturday because for lots of people they don't go to work  and  is the only day off of the majority of people. If you don't get up enough early you can't find a parking  in the town centre, all of them are full before 11 am. In the street is so crowded that you can't walk like usually and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lost them. In the shops is worth, if you are lucky and you find a clothes with your right size you will wait 20 min. at the fitting room and after that 20 min more at the cash desk. In the supermarket  is the same. When you buy food or drink they give you  plastic bag for carry it  and this bags broke every time. At the end of the month when your husband will receive the bill from you visa card he will have an heart-attack! Why not buy with  internet or if you have a nice mother at home enjoy this time because shopping is like go in the jungle. ",24.0
1134," Dear Mr. Robertson. I and all of my college have read your programme, which you organised for us, for our three days trip to London. We all think the programme is organised well, especially we're so keen on the idea  to go to the National Art Gallery, to see  work of the bigest painters on the world. I'm writing to you, because we saw a great advetisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show. The show will be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday,  14th of March between 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm. I think it's a great opportunity because, we will have a chance to se the latest fashion, leisure and sport wear, and as well the way to do the perfect make up and hairstyl. In my opinion, we can have a great time there, and entrence is free of charge for students, what is very important as well. I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go on that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to  next day. I hope you'll think about our proposition and consider to change the programme. Your faithfully  [SEP]  'My perfect holiday' 'It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it' My story began on my holiday. It was  nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine have decided to go for holiday this year to the see side. We thought  with that beutiful weather the seeside is just perfect for relax, sunbathing and joy. However the truth was a little bit diffrent. The things started happening from the first day we arrived. The weather had changed suttendly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and  rain. Despide of that we were still thinking optimisticly. We were thinking is so many other activites to relax and enjoy ourself then sunbathing on the beach. We went to  few Exhibitions, night clubs,  restaurants around  area and we really had a fun. In the end, the weather got better, so we decided to go to the beach. Everything was showing, today was going to be a good, sunny day. We went for swimming. Then again in a few minutes the weather changed and  strong storm begun. The sky went completly black, so at first it was difficult to see, where everybody is. I look around and I relised one friend of mine is still in the see, and fighting with  storm, trying to get to the side. I didn't think just went  to save my friend. Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunetly  ended good. That was the end of our holiday, and next year for sure we won't be going to the see side. ",25.00

Dear Madame, I have received your good news and I'm very happy because I have always wished go to California and now it's real , so, thank you very much about that. First at all, I would like to give you some further information from me and secondly, I'll  ask you for some doubts that I have. About, when I would like to travel I think that my answer will be easy for you, because, I have two months off those are July and August so, my travel should be in between,  my accomodation I would like to stay in  tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru,  long time ago, it was wonderful. With regard to the activities at the Camp, I would like to choose basketball and photography, because I think that basketball is  very complete sport for training your muscles and I used to play in a league in my country, it's hard but at the same time lovely. The other selection has been done because I like to much discover different places and with a camera  is possible to do it easily. If it  possible for you to help me in some doubts I have, I'll be really greatful. One  is with regard to how much additional money you believe will be enough to enjoy the holiday? Another thing  is if the meals are include or  I have to paid for them? Once again, thanks. Waiting for your reply, best wishes. Your faitfull. Daniel Ortiz  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have heard from you recently and I'm really happy, I hope you and your family are well. I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much. Besides, she told me that you are very keen to know how was my experience, so I'll give you some information in this letter that I'm sure you will be glad , even  you have not been in the concert. First at all, I'll tell you that in the day  concert I woke up at 6:30 A.M, very early for me, you know me I'm lazzy, the work began around 8:30,  was very hard but when the band come for training, since this moment I was enjoining to work until the concert had finished, the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind with every one who was working because they understood that  a concert is a job to be done by a team. During the concert I listened  the band like everybody , besides I earned money so,  was a wonderful experience. Looking forward to hear from you. You Sincerely. ",21.0
175," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show I have seen last Friday in your theatre. Unfortunately your advertisement about it wasn't true! Firstly, it's written that  it will be played by Danny Brook, but in fact it wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard about it. In addition to this, the timetable 19.30 wasn't correct. We've lost our time waiting outside in the cold  that the doors would get opened 45 minutes later. Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a reduce. Again, it wasn't true. When I enquired about the discounts, at the cashier they told me that they didn't have any information about it. At least, after all my disappointments when I wanted to visit your restaurant, it was closed because it was too late. I think that you are not a good manager. Therefore, I should be grateful if you would send me back some money for all the disagreements I've had in your theatre. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is my best friend. We spent all our childhood together usually driving our parents mad. As we grown up, we were getting closer and closer sharing all our love stories and even more. I'm certain, that our friendship is stronger than other people. But I do have a problem with her. Pat isn't good at keeping secrets. Even worth, she is not able to keep anything . For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday asking all . friends  to close their mouths. All did except one: Pat. Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately driving too fast I drove through the front gate. I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them. Of course, the following day all my family had heard about my odd story. In conclusion to this, why do I still go on with her, it's the fact I love her as well as my sister and I know that she can change it if she would because last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.

828," Dear Miss Ryan, I have safely received your letter bringing the good news. I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found  that I won the competition. Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received. I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience. Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember. Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons. Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just stay in Camp California all the time? I hope that I haven't taken up too much time. Thank you for this exciting news. I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime! Yours sincerely, (Au Kwan Ming)  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience. The concert was held at our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result. Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements. I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall. I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular. It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers. I really enjoyed myself and I hope that you can have the chance to experience this too. I hope that you can write to me soon. I look forward to reading what you have to say. Bye for now! Yours faithfully, (Au Kwan Ming)  ",40.0
580," Camp California in the U.S.A. Competition Organiser 13th June 2000 DEAR Helen Ryan, I am really happy for receive your congratulations. Was  very exciting moment and  very nice competition. And now to be the first winner. Is wonderful for me to have the opportunitie to visit the Camp California in the U.S.A. In answer at your letter. I would like to travel in July for two reason one's is because I totaly will finish my exam in that date and the other   in the first two week  I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and will be there the delegation from my country. And for the second question. About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp I would prefer  log cabins; because maybe  is more interesting to share with other people. In other hand you ask me I have the chance for to choose two activities while I am at the camp. but  is no easy, because all is very interesting for me. But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for practice climbing and surfing. Meanwhile, these activities are develop. Can you said me if  is necessary to bring  special clothes, I refer for instance if I practice surfing  I need  water suit. Is  possible to get  there? At the same situation for climbing  I need  special equipment and then there are  available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities?  I need  extra money? I am really appreciate  if you can answer me these doubt and saying again. Thanks very much, because is new stimulation for me. this prize. Yours sincerely, Isabel Cruz  [SEP]  13th June, 2000 Shopping is not always enjoyable. I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view, because we can studie the  reaction before, during and after to shopping. People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary. We must to accept that  media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V. For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes, cosmetic, accesories, jewels etc. And the other  they choose sometimes just for the label. Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area, because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they  shopping they choose pre-prepared food. We know  is more easy for these  busy life. In the other hand the facilities for access to  mall center is not good. The area for parking, space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate. Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable. I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment. which is special place in the town we  lefet just for  comerical area, but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket, and mall centre in different areas of the city.

162," Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spent the hole  last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" was (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city. But from the beginning we found a lot of problems. Despite we are actors we had to pay  a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you  the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show. I am waiting  your answer,  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life. Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic. Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space. Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of  Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays, and send my work to the office everyday. ",35.0
1226," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing to you to give you the information about the conference. The hotel your group has been booked into is called  Palace Hotel. It is simple to find the way from this hotel to the conference. You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel. There you will find a modern building with two different doors a red  and a blue one. You are asked to take the blue door. After entering you will see the signed conference room. We organized a end-of-conference party on the day before your departure. Everyone is welcome to join   this party   to get to know each other in a good atmosphere. You should wear nice and comfortable cloth. This is an informal party. I suggest you visiting the old part of Zurich or going to the zoo before your departure. I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference. If there is any question left, please contact me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Most Important Invention I love baking cakes, cockies and breads. Baking is  passion and in the town  I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area. It doesn't matter in what kind of mood I am, I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good. But I couldn't bake without an oven. I'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion. I think the oven is one of the most important inventions. If there is someone who doesn't agree with me, he or she should try to live  one month without using the oven. Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys. I'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes. I'm thanking the person who invented the oven. Thank you! ",36.00

If there is no chance to go to California on July, I could wait untill next summer. About accommodation, I would like to  a long cabin because last year I had an accident and my back is enjure, so sleeping in a tent it would be painful for me. I play basketball at university and my level is quite good but  I am really enjoying is being a referee. Due to my back enjure, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit, it would be a good aidea to be a referee. I would like to swim everyday if  is able. Althoung swimming is so bored, it would be a good  help for curing my back. Could you please let me know where will I eate? if will there be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it? how many money  you think will I need for those two weeks? And please could you give me  details about how does the weather  like there and what type the clothes will I have to bringh? Looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerily  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was brilliant! I had the best month in my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard, I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys with funny people. My job was cleaning the ground after the concert; ""it was very dirty"". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course, I had not to pay for getting in. I felt in love with a beautiful girl ""Calen"", she is from Spain and was selling ""hot dogs"". She will come to Liverpool next week and I'll put her up. Probably she'll come with a friend  if you want you can enjoy us. Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've done a new friends and I know that in the concert there isn't any drunk just funny and wonderful people. I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help in ""Doctor Meesee"" that is the best concert in the world, I hope you will come there. You have to save up  money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..). Love ",29.0
1168," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give some information on the conference as you required. First of all, your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is very convenient to stay  and has  beautiful landscape. I would recommend you get to the conference by subway, because  subway station is situated in 5 minutes' walk from the hotel. It will take you about 15 minutes to arrive at the college. There will be a party after the conference. We will serve you dinner and some college students are going to sing, play musical instruments and so on, but you can join  if you wish. Therefore, you had better wear casual and comfortable clothes. Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on. You will be able to buy them in   reasonable price. I hope you will enjoy your stay in my country. I look forward to meeting all of you.

986," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote  me asking for my preferences about the Camp. About the information you needed, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, because of work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in  tents, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a boyscout and go against the routine. From the list of activities you sent me, I stay with the, from my point of view, most relaxing activities available: painting and photography. One of my hobbies is the photography, so I think I am rather good at it, but I will take painting only to learn, because I am not very talentive at it. I also would like to know if I have to take  money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location. Please reply  soon. Yours sincerely David Brian  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! A couple of months ago, I was told that Britney Spears was coming to perform in our city. When I knew this, I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepares the stage during the concert. I was really excited. The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle. And I didn't even got paid. But it was worthy. I found my reward when the concert finished. After been carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was eshausted. But when Britney came out of the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write  me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me. Bye. With love David Brian ",32.0
919," Hi Helen, Im very excited because I won the first prize and my family is very proud of me. about the things you asked me in your letter I would like to go to camp California on july because that's the month when I go out from school and I have my vacations and I think it would be much easier that month. About my acommodations in the camp I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more confortable. The activities that I would like to do are signing because my friend told me that im good at it. and the other activitie that I would like to do is climbing because I thing it  very exciting although I have never tried climbing. because in my city there are no mountains. I just want to ask you for something else. How many jeans, Pants, sweater etc... do I have to take? and how much money would I need to bring in my pocket? I appreciate that opportuniti that you are giving to me and Im very thankful to you guys. atte. Henrique Aguilar  [SEP]  Dear Kim Im having a great time here in brazil, I have been going out with some friends an now I have a girlfriend.

488," Dear Sir, I address this letter to the manager of the theatre. I want to talk to you about an evening I had in your theatre : OVER THE RAINBOW. Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthousiasm. But I had a very disappointing evening and it was because  many points. First point, I didn't see Danny BROOK as starring. I was coming to see him but there was a different actor. Second point, the musical show had to begin at 7:30 PM but we have waited for fourty five minutes to see the show started. Third point, your advertisement told  about  ""discount available"" about the ticket's price but it wasn't . Fourth point, after the show, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant but it was closed and no one didn't know why! Well, as you see it wasn't a ""perfect evening out!"" and I think that you could give to me some money back because I really have the impression that your advertisement is wrong. I'm waiting about your news, Yours FAITHFULLY,  [SEP]  We live in a society where the technology grows up everyday. We can find some everywhere. Then, I think it's interssant to answer the following question: How has modern technology changed my daily life? My plan will be very simple: a description in a first time and an analysis in a second time. Everyday at 7:00 a.m, I am woken up by my radio. After, when I take my breakfast, I use my toaster for my bread and, as I want a hot milk, I use my modern oven too. When I go to school, I can see in many stores the new tools they've just received. But I think that the most important  is my cellular phone: I can give a call or receive a call from everywhere. This little paragraph shows that I depend of technology and, more over, because I'm in an electronic eegenering school, I'm keen on technology. I don't know if it is good or bad but we are a generation who's grown up with technologies progress. Modern technology doesn't changed my daily life, it just allows  to evoluate in this new world....

889," Dear Miss Ryan,  I am writing in reply to your letter, informing me that I have won the prize in your competition which is two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am really pleased to hear that the prize includes accommodation. I would like to stay in a tent, because I have been camping nearly every summer since my childhood and I really love it. I would be really happy if I could apply Singing and Photography as the activities you have written about. Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5. I could say that I am quite good at it. However, I used to assist my brother, who is a profecional photographer. So that, I consider myself expirienced enough. I would like to ask you whether going there in July is possible. I am afraid that July is the only appropriate month, because I am due to start work in August. Finally, I would like to ask you for further information about  spending allowance and the clothes which I am supposed to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry I haven't written for so long. But I've been quite busy just recently. Last month, I helped  at a pop concert which I really enjoyed. The singer, who took place, wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being  stuff there, was just amazing. I was just behind the stage. I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so that I could see all that screaming like made crowd. I even saw crying girls, who were trying to reach the pop-singer. Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly . I think you never realize this, until you're not a part of the crowd. But I'm really happy, that I had even  small role in making people enjoying themselves. I mean, all that flashing lights,  the changing colours of them, I believe they helped much. Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself being very successful. And finally, the greatest news. I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there. He was so nice and he even gave me his picture whit his signature on it. I suppose, I will never forget that night. That's about all my news, I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Lots of love, ",36.0
577," Dear Helen Ryan, I was really glad to receive your letter and find out that I won the competition. I am writing this letter to give you all the necessary details. First of all, you have asked me when I would like to travel. Actually, I could only travel in July, when I am having my school vacations and I will be totally free. As you have asked me about the accommodation, I would be grateful if I could stay in a tent - as it seems to be more practical and comfortable. Among the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - ,and Photography - from which I know just the basical skills. I would like to know if I should take  winter-clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Natalia Lopes  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable With the increasing of violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres. Shopping may be very enjoyable, in fact, as people get in contact with new products, take a look at shops, buy some things or just walk around. But it can also be dangerous. First, most part of shoping centres uses artificial illumination and refiguration, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring. Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumism may develop to a compulsion. There are cases of people that can not spend one day without buying anything. After all that we can notice that shopping can be a good option as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time. ",35.0
1203," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about  international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed. The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite to the hotel) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it. There is a party on the last day of the conference. Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best. Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music, dancing and fun are provided. Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11pm. You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party. Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about  free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to  for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone, a car, a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us (or we have got used) as we use them every day. Hundred years before people couldn't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer. They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so. Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them. First of all they say about  enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others . But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then. I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone  doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention  hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life. Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an automobile transport is  undenyable neccecerity in our life. In case of all  said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel's inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages. ",24.00
