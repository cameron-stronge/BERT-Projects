1046," Dear Mr Robertson! I'm writting to you to thank you for  good programme of our English class in London, especially for  river trip to Greenwich, it will be a great experience for us. But the students in our class have seen an adverstisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which'll take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show. It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions, make up,  hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends. There is one more advantage: it is free for students. So we would like to suggest you how the programme could be changed. First of all on Tuesday we all will go to the show and spend there all our day, but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have  free time we can go to the Science Museum if you don't mind, of course. Please let us know, as soon as you make your decission. With best wishes, your student.  [SEP]   Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Lucas! Thank you very much for your letter, I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you. First of all I want to congratulate your cousin with fifteenth birthday and with  all the best. I hope that it will be  good holiday for her, her family and friends. Now about your questions, it is very difficult for me to give any advice you about it, I don't know your cousin very well so I don't know what she prefers reading. But when I was fifteen my favourite book  "" Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". So I can recommended you to present  this book, because it is  very interesting, amuse, sometimes dramatic and mystery book. This book help us to impove our logic, mind,  memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, be more honest with other people and pay attention for the smallest details in our life because sometimes it can help us very very much. So I hope I could help you. Write  me as soon as you can. With best wishes, your ",28.00
895," Thomas West 24 Kingsberry place CS4 1XD Tuesday 13th june to Helen Ryan Competition Organiser at Camp California Dear Madame, thank you for your letter, I've been so happy to receave such a good news that I can't already believe it. To answer your first question, I would like to travel on july if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at this time of the year. In the accomodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, he is going to be more funny, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question. I can see in the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quiet good. I finished 5th at the England Golf tour junior  in 1999, and basketball, because I would like to discover this sport I only used to play at school. I've got other questions: wich type of clothes do I have to bring? Can I change money on the campus? Are some party organized during the holidays? Is there only one teatcher for each sport, and how many are we in each group of activities? Thank you for all  informations you could give me. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report about which lessons and activities we should film. First, I think we can't shoot a film only about lessons or only about breaks, because this two elements are representative of a daily life at school aren't they? First, we should film some lessons because everybody know (or remember for the growns up) that it is the activity that to be the most of a student time at school. Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily school! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free,  there are no teatchers, it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons. To come back to a strict (a little beat less) subject, I suggest that we film the sport lesson , doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups. Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchers, we mustn't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchers.

1057," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, all the students and I would thank  you for this great idea of a trip in London during three days. The programme is very exating and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Otherwise, all the class have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", and we are all interested  to see this show, this is why I am writing to you. In fact this is a great opportunity because we certainly will not have again the chance to take part in a live show, like this one. Even more, the students don't pay the entrance. The show is on the 14th from 10.00 to 19.00, so I suggest to go to the Science Museum on the afternoon of Wednesday, and just have two or three hours free time after the museum. This is the arrangement that we fouded with the other students and everyone had agree. I look forward to hear  news from you. Your Faithfull,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. The survive of my family depended on me. We were a poor family, living in one room for five persons. My father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children. We haven't enough money to buy food,  new clothes and the worse  was that my youngerst brother was terribly ill, and without money we couldn't bring him up to a doctor. So, a day I decided to steal the bank. During weeks, I had prepared my programme, trying not to forget something important. Everything was ready and me  too. So I knew that the day after would be the good one. I get up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had founded a little window at the back of the building, so I entered by this way and by chance I just arrived in the monney's room. I hadn't never seen so much money. I took it, the most of possible and went out by the same way. I ran to my house and went back in my bed for sleep a little bit. When all the family get up, I told us the true and  all promised to say nothing. It was our family's secret. ",24.00
981," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was pleasantly surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. Firstly, I would like to answer your questions. As I am doing my A-levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August, I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent. It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins. I enjoy basketball very much and I am quite good at it. I would like to play this game at your camp. I have never tried out climbing, but I have always wished to do it one day. Would it be possible to do this activity at your camp as a beginner? Secondly, I would like to ask you for some information. Would you be kind enough to tell me which kind of clothes I should bring with me? Could you possibly tell me how much money I might spend at California Camp? Would you recommend me to bring some equipment, like a rope, sticks, with me? Thank you in advance for your help. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi, how are you? I'm actually fine at the moment, but have to study a lot because of my exams in English. You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and  make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could stay at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signature. He was fantastic, you know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you see many stars out of stage. And you might manage to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money, not a lot but enough for me. Well I'll have to close now. Give my regards to your parents. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. With love, ",37.0
35," Jane Clark, The organiser, I am writting to you to give your my opinion about your festival. It was great, but I think it could be even better next year. First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries were here. So, if you can have more than six countries, it could be great. This idea is in relation with the number of plays and films. If there are more stars and artists from around the world, there are more plays and films and it is better. My second complain is about some   concert halls which are too small. It would be better if you have some  large halls, like your ""Arena"" hall. To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one reasonally price, because for someone who do not like especially art, it was very attractive. A least suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some ""salsa"" band, It would be great to listen and dance in the same time  ""salsa"" music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jimmie, I was very happy to receive a letter from you. I am writting to you to answer at your question about school rules and what I am (and I am not) allowed to do at home. Firstly in the school it is not permitted to smoking in the no smoking area or in the classroom. But, I think it is the same in England. Secondly, when you want to ask a question to the teatcher, you must to put your hand up, and speak when the teacher ask you. In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly. For example, put the music  too hight when my syster is working. But there are also some life's rules, like do not put  legs on the table when we are eating or  eat with my fingers. There are not really anything that I could like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries. It is just polite's rules. I hope I answered to your question. Big kisses, ",26.00
445," Dear Sir, I have come to watch the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' in the Circle Theatre. I was really disappointed because a lot of things were not done. I will explain these now and want to ask to get some of the money I have given you back. It was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show. Danny Brook was not there, a different actor was in his place. That was very disappointing for me. The musical show was going to start at 19.30, but it started t 20:15. We have waited for 45 minutes getting bored for it to start! When I went to buy tickets, they didn't accept the discounts. But I had read that the discounts were available. Like it was written again, we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed. They said that the time was late and they wanted to go home. There was nothing for us to do, the show started 45 minutes later. Now, I think that you have seen it was not a perfect evening at all, a lot of  things written were not done So I am asking to get some of my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  DAILY LIFE - MODERN TECHNOLOGY MY daily life. I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do. I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost in  Internet. etc. Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it in a normal day, but when I sit and think, its everywhere! For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example for modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at last! TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels. Now it's colourful and there are many channels on TV. You watch whichever you want. I can't think that I watch the same channels every day. A wonderful example for modern technology:  Computer! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most of the people. And  Internet. You can look for everything you want. You can talk to every people living all around the world. You don't understand the time passing when you are in that world. You can have information about all the things,  go everywhere. Everything is near you. You can reach them whenever you want! You see, our daily life consists of modern technology. It would be hard to live without it. ",27.0
1174," Dear Maria, I'm so happy to help you for this international student conference. I'm afraid for Richard. Could you please tell him my best wishes of  health? I'm sure  you can perfectly replace it to lead your group. At first, you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel that is one of the best in the town. The access to the conference place is very easy. First of all, you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop, then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college. After the conference, there is a great party that is organised by friends. It starts at twenty o'clock  until the end of the night, so be ready! There is no special thema for the wearing style but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy... Finally, I propose you to go to the new college swimmingpool on the last day   afternoon. Every body will go there. I hope you will have fun! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello, I will give you some informations on the yverdon's castle. This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town. I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developped around it since its creation. Those days, the castle is being remade, so there is a lot of construction engines around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries. There is a lot of old items that were in the King's family. You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years... You can see it in the dungeon. So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide. I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon. Best regards, ",27.00
807," Dear Helen, I received your letter the other day,  I was very happy to find out that I won two weeks at Camp California. Well, to answer to your questions, I would prefer to attend at this camp during the month of July because it is the only time when I can get vacations. It is because I am an apprentice, so they let me have my vacations only in July!! Well, for the accomodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like  adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to the nature, and the animals! For the activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it, I used to do some competitions when I was younger. And for the other  I will chose tennis, I really enjoy this sport, I am not really a good player but I like to practice tennis during my free time! Since I'm coming during the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me, and I have another question, it's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have change or checks? Best Regards, Helen  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Well this is abosolutly true, espacially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed, and most of the people are stressed, it's crazy. For exemple you go into a cloth shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt, so they are looking every where, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have  and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose. And you have to wait after  to buy it, so finally you waited so long that you are getting late, so you get stressed to. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them. So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if I can give you an advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!! ",34.0
1059," Dear Mr Robertson I would like to congratulate you for the excellent programme that you have prepared. I think that  is such a good programme especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting. However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London  where the latest fashions will be shown. There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles, too. And it has free-entrance for the students. We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London,  the 14th of March. We think that, if you don't have any problem, we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show. We are wating for your decision and we will accept it whatever it  be. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  ""THE HOME OF THE FUTURE"" From any point of view, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just  pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa. Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very important, they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier. The cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. In balance then, I think that the houses that we can see on films won't really exist. ",33.00
953," Dear Miss/Mrs. Ryan, I have just received the excellent news about the prize I have won and I am writing to you in order to give you all the details you need. Firstly, I can only travel in July, as it is then when I get my holiday from my present job. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, because when I was a child I used to go to a campsite and stay in a tent with my family for two weeks every summer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. About the activities I can choose from, I would be delighted if I could sing, because it is something that I have always loved and, although perhaps I should not say that myself, I think I have a nice voice. I am also very fond of photography, so when I have seen that it is among your options it has been a wonderful surprise. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp, the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves. I am looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks very much for your last letter. Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month, I'll tell you something: it was fantastic. I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt  the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it. When we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat. But the most amazing thing happened later, when ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always keep it like a treasure. I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, O.K? Till then, take care  yourself. Love, ",36.0
933," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I received your letter last monday. I want to say thank you that I was the lucky person who won that competition. It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States and I am so happy about that, I can not explain it. You want to know some further information from me. About the date, when I want to travel can I say that it is only possible for me on July because I have to do some exams at the school. I would prefer to the accommodation at the camp a tent, the reason is that I like to live realy natural and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent then in  cabins. As activities I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me. In basketball I have  more practise then in tennis. I play every weekend on competitions with my local team and about tennis it is that I tried but it is not like my basketball experience. Also I want to know how much clothes and  money I would need for these two weeks. Please write  me  your answer as quick as possible. I hope I can hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you my lovely penfriend? I hope good. You want to know how was it to work and help at a pop concert? It is marvelous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I should help to bring the staff for the band, things like guitars, drums and others. It was maybe hard work for a while but I was so happy about that to help on a real big pop concert I can't decribe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and diner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I realy enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, when not the greatest experience in my life. On the other hand it was a good paid job with 15 pounds per hour, what do you can say. The organizer of the tournement have spoken with me and asked me if I want I could do the same work in two months at the concert by the Rolling Stones is that not fantastic. I couldn't believe it but he gave me the contract to fill it out. I hope Kim you was not too jealous about that, sorry. Please write  me soon, I'm waiting. Loves ",28.0
472," Dear Sir or Madam! I'm writing to you because of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre. There are several points I have to complain  wich made the evening  not nice at all. At first the show started much later than it was written out. Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons, the first one is that there was no information  how much time the start of the show is going to be late . The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month. After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor, who couldn't sing as half as good then Brook. On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available, when I ask at the ticket reception I couldn't get any discount for beeng  student. To make an result the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like  promised. For these reasons I want to ask you to get my money of £25 back. reasently Miss. Winkler  [SEP]  What is the prize? Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He didn't want to say what Sarah just had told him, it just came over  his mouth, when he talked to James. ""Sarah has won in a quiz show?"" James was more than just interested, he wanted to know what she had won. But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he already had told enough. After one hour the hohle class had heard about Sarah's secret. Everybody was interested in what she had won but knowbody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told in a secret to them. Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around a talking and wispering started. Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him did you tell anybody about our secret. Pat told her everything. Sarah looked at him for a while, than she stood in front of the class and explaind to the others, that she won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the sea of southern France and everybody of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Do you know, I am amuzing  to play tennis? I am  tennis first team in my school, so I can show my highly tennis skill during the holidays, and I can play Basketball as well, but not very good, you can say I only know how to play. Do you mind tell me what is the weather , when I  during the holiday, what kind the money I should bring with me and what language I should know in there? Please write back. take care From  [SEP]  What do you think about shopping? Very Fun, very happy, if go with your girl friend  will feel romatic, you should think something like this, but do you know  is not always like this. When you go to shopping with your girl friend, she want to watch every  clothes in the shopping centre, but you are not interesting of that, romatic, no! I think you will feel boring. If you interesting of the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, they should had diffence fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so at the last you both two will feel unhappy or angry to each other. If you go out with your same sex friend that should be fine, same fashion, but  everytime  go to the same place, everyone will feel boring. Shopping is enjoyable, but not very offer, so don't say to everyone  shopping is always enjoyable! ",19.0

1215," 12, June, 2001 Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter about the international student conference. Here are  answers for your questions. You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated in front of the railway station, Camberley. To get  the conference, you catch the coach No.7 from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop. It takes 5 minutes from the station. When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held. The end-of-conference party will be held at the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium. It starts at 18 p.m. and ends at 22 pm. We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign country will prepare their ethnic foods. There is a museum next to the Camberley Station, which has  good collection of paintings and potteries, and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time. Instead, there are a lot of shops around there, you can buy souvenirs. I am looking forward to meeting you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: Student from the United States From: Juli The aim of this report is to describe the Haunted Castle in Camberley. Place This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods. Inside of the castle is always dark even in  daytime. Story It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost. She appears occationaly and opens every window in the castle. It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window. People said she was seeking something and  still seeking  even if she had dead for 500 years. Conclusion The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture of  16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is worth while to see . I hope you'll enjoy visiting there.

Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off in the beginning of the month. For the accommodation, I would prefer in  tents because I like adventure and simplicity. Concerning the available activities, firstly, I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years. Secondely, I am interested in discovering something that I have never done, so I would like to do sailing. Finally, I was wondering if some special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip? I thank you in advanced and looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writing to you to relate my experience in helping at a pop concert last month. First of all, I would like to tell you that I've never had a such good time in my life! The day one consisted in surrounding the festival's place with fences. The second day objective was to install the scene, with lights, loudspeakers and all stuff. This job was quite hard, but we took enough time to be not exhausted! The last day, in fact the concert day was absolutely fantastic. The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer  front of the scene, to avoid the people coming on the concert floor.

Firstly, since I'll be very busy during the next three months due to my job's demands, I would like to travel in July. Although the weather may not be friendly, it is the only time I have to see the beauty of the camp. I'll choose to stay in  tents, considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way. And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child, these will be the activities I'll like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things! I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which  will be necessary for me to take. I'm looking forward to joining you in July and hoping for this trip to be an amazing experience. Yours sincerely Pablo Picasso  [SEP]  Shopping can be painful As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink. It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts. Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains. Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces. ",36.0
1239," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference. The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel on Old Street. There will be signs to follow from  Central train station. The conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00-15.00. Light lunch will be provided. After the conference, there will be a relaxing party. There is no dressed-code for the party. However I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference. I have included the local map, there are some ideas at the back of the map. Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours, We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance. Personly I recommend the Dicken's tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical. I hope that I have covered all  information you would need and look forward to seeing you. Your sincerely, P.S. Please find the enclosed map.  [SEP]  There are several interesting buildings in the city of London. I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top  list. The building itself looks grand and elegant. Despite the fact that this building has served half-a million commuters in a day, it  always clean and functional. There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting  building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern  style with escalators and touched-screen ticket machine. It is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation. The old bit is rather unique and charming. You could really imagine how it looked like in the old day. There is another surprising section in this building. At the far back of the station  is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park. It is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public. Finally, it is in the heart of  city and everyone would be able to find  without doubt. ",32.00
1243," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college. However, due to the congestions and delay near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is by  underground,  Victoria Street station. You would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes. At the end-of-conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities. All different types of clothing could be worn however jean wears and T-shirts would be common on that day. Instead  staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre. The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium,  market square, could be found near our monument of our town, the Saltisy Bridge. I am looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Little Woods shopping mall Location The Little Woods shopping mall is an idea place for you and your group to visit. It is located very close to the town centre next to the town museum. It can be accessed by the nearby train station. Facilities For those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewellery, stationary, book shops, fashion and beauty departments and many more are availiable. For those who want something more exciting and advanturous, you are recommanded to visit the Fun Fair and amusement  on the top floor of the building. Other facilities such as cinemas, theatres,  large department stores could also be found . There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from aboard  to enter the car park. Conclusion Not only the tourist information centre would provide the information you might need, you could also visit the ICT block which allows you to access onto anything you want to know from the computers. A special trip could also be organized. ",30.00
339," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I would like to complain about a musical show. I was very disappointing  a week holiday for me because I had got a lot of problem with the show. I had seen  the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it was not Danny Brook. I was really disappointing because he is my famous actor. The musical should started at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. When I went to asked for the discount of  ticket in the cashier desk they told me no discount  available for this. I had seen the advertisement say that  discount  available. After the show I decide to had dinner in your theatre restaurant, but I couldn't because it  closed. It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm. This was not  perfect evening for me, so if you don't give  my money back, I will tell to the newspaper about it. I am looking forward to hear a good new. Yours sincerely, Boo Sersuwan.  [SEP]  I think in the next 100 years people will wear the space clothes with  small engine in the back. because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere in the earth  now starting badly every years. The  carbon dioxide are growing very fast and people cut  more trees, therefore  not enough trees to such carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. The designer will have a lot of idea for how to make very nice and useful clothes. I think if we wear this clothes we will travel to every where easier than we use cars, ships, planes and space ships. This mean the engineering will find the way to useless petrol for it, so it must useful in the future. I think somebody will make a very big area to grow plant because they can sell the oxygen. This is a new business. I think I can win this price, because this clothe will produce in the future soon. ",21.0
184," Dear Sir, The reason for which I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you. I hope you will not feel offensed, but I really needed to contest about your theater. I was present at your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening. Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here! You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it! How rude! Moreover; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30; it actually started at exactly 20.15! 45 minutes latter: where we had nothing to do, but waiting. We couldn't even have a drink, because, obviously, the restaurant you talked about was closed! Really, what a mess in the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reached either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful client. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  If more and more ingenors work on science and technology, it must be that it is really usefull: but in what particular way? For my part, I know it would be such a pain in my neck. The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot. I guess I could not live without many instruments. The first  I think of is  internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do. It also makes me write to my friends by e-mail. I did not to write at all to people until I have got   internet. By this procedure, you only type and send, no need to going to the post-office! Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force me a little, and then go to the library and to the post-office, but  internet just makes it easier! I am also very fond of cell-phones. These are also such a relief. I can go anywhere without being nervous about the fact, that maybe someone is trying to reach me! Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me  to be more peaceful and I think it is essential. Although I am thankful to modern technology! ",35.0
126," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to complain about the problems  were exist on the musical show. First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not. Another actor took his place. After that, the time that the show should start was 19:30 but it started fortyfive minutes later. People have been started to complain. What about the available discounts. They were not exist. Except of this there  more. After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed, because the chef of the restaurant was ill. This is not an excuse. You have to excuse me but this was a very disappointing evening. I would like  to return to me my money back. I am very disappointed with you. I did not expect these problems from you. I am waiting  your answer as soon as possible. Yours faithfully   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day Brian, the best friend of Pat told him a secret. An important secret for Brian. He told him, that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth the best friend of Jane. He didn't told  the secret because he wanted to heard Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very shame to ask Jane  in  date. So, Beth, asked Jane if she is in love with Brian and she said that she was. When Pat heart the good news he told to Brian to asked her  in  date and he knew that she will accepted. Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him. Jane and Brian were very happy. Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",24.0
304," Dear sir or madam, My name is Molly Menbrook. I have seen your new musical, 'Over the rainbow'. I am sorry but I must admit it was a bit disappointing. I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant except it wasn't open. I couldn't see anyone inside either. No one. The show it self was quite disappointing. The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors. I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical... Also you mentioned a discount. For tickets. Well no, I didn't get a discount! And the tickets were pretty expensive... Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with  hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in. Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the runner of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him. So you see my point. It wasn't very pleasant. So I am going to ask for a refund... I hope this isn't affending you too much... Or asking you for too much. Reply as soon as possible, best regards,  [SEP]  I think the clothes in future will be similar in shape as the clothes that exist now. Just like sweaters, shoes, t-shirts etc... But maybe not. When it comes down to color, I think it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery. Like shiny and plastic kind. Maybe silver and gold, glittery red, purple and blue. As well as bright yellow, orange and green. All suitable for discos! Shoes will be high heeled and modern. Colors to match the clothes. Still, comfortable. I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens. But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick in them! Though some people may fancy the glitter and the spacy feel, I don't like it and I hope it really isn't the style for the future. It's just not my cup of tea... ",30.0
341," Dear Mr. ... It wasn't the first time for me to visit this show in your theatre, but it was the worsed one. At first it was a great plessure for me to get a ticket therefor becauses I'm one of the greatest fan of Danny Brook. It's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but I had choosen it, because I'm (alowed?). When  musical started at 20:15 (not at 19:30 as showed) I was realy shokked when I realised that a different actor was playing . I couldn't stay any more and had to leave the theatre. You have to know that I am very sik because of my blood presure and so I was laying down the hole weekend. In my opinion it's a simple way for you to pay me the money I left back. Otherwise I have to contact my lower. I am waiting hearing of you.  [SEP]  For me as an scientist it's a main problem to show how the inovations of the last century goes up with the environment and natur. In  past new technologies  mostly followed by ground-, water- or air pollution. A nowadays simple thing like a computer include so many possible ways  to destroy different environmental compartiments. On the one hand there are the materials from which the PC's are made of, on the other hand is the uge waste problem situated. Now I try to show, in my daily work, how the airborn chlororganics, which are degased from plastics, will be seperated and damaged by green plants. Sometimes it seems to me like  joke if I remember all the daungerous materials I need to do my job. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the only way to find a better kind of living with the nature is to check out the problems we have. Therefore it make sense to use the inovation which are standing for environmental destructions. ",15.0
437," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show, which was played at The Circle Theatre last week. Unfortunalety my feelings are rather bad. I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning  'Over the Rainbow' musical show. The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. Especialy due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' even did not appologize for this range. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have been ( started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite I am a student and the advertisement said that discounts were available, I was refused to buy a half-a-price ticket, and the explaination 'why' wasn't sufficiant. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which according to the advertisement ought to be open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angier. There was no information  why it was closed and if it would be open at all. The advertisement say 'your perfect evening out', however it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you give me my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday, however on Friday almost half of my class knew what's going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I would pass the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving center for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I hope that nobody would watching me. Unfortunately Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The instractur opened the car  and asked me to sit on the drivers sit. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very ofen crossing the white line on the road. I looked at the mirror and I saw how my friends were lauthing. It made my crazy. I started doing stupid things: turn right instead of left and so on. Next day, I decided that I don't want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment  my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. Eventually the things weren't so bad. I went to school and everyone was very friendly. Pat appologized  me for not keeping the secrets. At the begining I was very angry but in the end I said that everything is O.K. We are good friends nowadays, however I will never tell her my secrets. ",25.0
488," Dear Sir, I address this letter to the manager of the theatre. I want to talk to you about an evening I had in your theatre : OVER THE RAINBOW. Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthousiasm. But I had a very disappointing evening and it was because  many points. First point, I didn't see Danny BROOK as starring. I was coming to see him but there was a different actor. Second point, the musical show had to begin at 7:30 PM but we have waited for fourty five minutes to see the show started. Third point, your advertisement told  about  ""discount available"" about the ticket's price but it wasn't . Fourth point, after the show, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant but it was closed and no one didn't know why! Well, as you see it wasn't a ""perfect evening out!"" and I think that you could give to me some money back because I really have the impression that your advertisement is wrong. I'm waiting about your news, Yours FAITHFULLY,  [SEP]  We live in a society where the technology grows up everyday. We can find some everywhere. Then, I think it's interssant to answer the following question: How has modern technology changed my daily life? My plan will be very simple: a description in a first time and an analysis in a second time. Everyday at 7:00 a.m, I am woken up by my radio. After, when I take my breakfast, I use my toaster for my bread and, as I want a hot milk, I use my modern oven too. When I go to school, I can see in many stores the new tools they've just received. But I think that the most important  is my cellular phone: I can give a call or receive a call from everywhere. This little paragraph shows that I depend of technology and, more over, because I'm in an electronic eegenering school, I'm keen on technology. I don't know if it is good or bad but we are a generation who's grown up with technologies progress. Modern technology doesn't changed my daily life, it just allows  to evoluate in this new world....

I can only travel in July because I had already booked and fully paid for a middle-east holiday, from 25th of July till  end of August. If you can arrange my departure time from 1st of July it should be convenience for me. I would like to stay in  tents because I had much great times in tents during my previous holidays, if it is suitable for you. I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp: Sailing and photography. I have great experience for sailing. I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey. And I have done  certificate for using  radio (VHF). I have knowladge about navigation, engine , ropes and knots and  sails as well. My other passion is photography, especially I like black and white photography. I have a camera which is a called Minolta X300. That is a manual camera. I know  to develop films and print them. I have doubt about clothes, money and  immigration rules of the USA. please could you write me how is the weather like there, what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping . I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and  products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products. Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card . It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless. As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about £500. This experience has changed my shopping habit, now I do all my shopping on the internet. But I'm not sure how it is safe. But you must be always award against to pickpokets. ",32.0
137," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment about your theatre. On the advertisement, that I have received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour. And there were no discounts available either, unlike it was written in the same advertisement. Another disappointing point was that I wanted to watch Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him. And the actor's performance was terrible. And finally, after the show I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to eat, but it was closed because of restoration. There was no notice about it in your advertisement. Because of all these reasons, which I have listed above, my evening which should have been perfect, turned into a disaster. So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And now the situation was becoming harder to get on with. On one side it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret. But on the other side it was her best friend's family, that she must lie to. Her best friend was going out with a boy that night, And she told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat's house, in order to get permission. So Pat could not decide what to do. She did not trust the boy, and it was very hard for her to lie to people, that she liked so much. And she realized that if something happens to her best fried, it would be her fault and her best friend's parents would blame her for it. She knew she would be very sorry too. So she decided to call the parents of her best friend and tell them what was going on. Of course, her best friend would never trust her again and never share any secrets, but she was doing this for her best friends sake, wasn't she? ",34.0

First of all I would like to thank you for organizing the programme. I read it and found it very good, specially,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts. However, I have a great proposition for you. Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I thing it is a great opportunity for us, as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students. Girls should like to see the latest fashion, new make-up and interesting hairstyles. Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear. I would like to suggest a change in the programme by giving up shopping and going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing form you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  THE HOME OF THE FUTURE Home is an important element in everybody's life. It gives you safety. I do not know people who would not want to have a home. We like our houses that is why  are always trying to make it more comfortable and useful. I think The Home of the Future will be bigger as we will need more room for us, our belongings and interests. The construction will be more simple what will give us a feeling of balance. More houses will have gardens what will make us feel closer to the nature. Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside. I do not think so. Because of computers we will have the possibility of working at home, therefore, home will be  very important place worth paying attention . Take care of your home, do not hesitate  in it and you will be very happy. ",30.00

I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay. As you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week, we can say that   a kind of relaxation time. Nothing will be spacial. Place is  College garden. Time is 7 pm. There is no need to bother  about clouths. Everybody can put on something casual. Befor  leav from England I suggest you to visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke. You could find the opportunaty to see the country life. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Time flies I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word. I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our times passing so fast. Can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus. May be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot. Try to imagine your life without having anyof them. Wouldn't  be unbarable and painful. Ceartainly it would be just like mine. Because I live in a rural area far from any village, town, or city center. The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot. I have no car,  no local bus service to use. Even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me. And ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life. But also I'm aware of that the time flies for me. I must do whatever I want befor it is too late. And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity. ",23.00
1183," Dear Mrs M. Smith, I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to give you all the information that you requested. First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel, 82 Regent Street, so that it is very easy to reach the conference. In fact you can take the bus number 3; as you can see, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel, then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass, on your right hand. Secondly, we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge. I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age. What is more, I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie. Finally, if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours. However, if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square. I hope you will find my letter of interest and I look forward to seeing you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Have you ever thought  to live without your car? How can you manage your daily life without it? I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car. It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted. On the other hand, this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy. In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring  lugguage and shopping bags. Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey. For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with. However, I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic. On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly. That's why I couldn't image my life without it. ",31.00
378," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' I've visited it last evening in your 'Circle Theatre'. By the way I would  enquire about  some money back. I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by visiting it. I believed in the phrase by which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect. The show should  started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very wrong and afraid about it and I remember that this was the third problem this evening. By arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there will come another problem. The problem came. The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show for eating something, was closed without any explaination and the perfect evening was completely unperfect. I think this are reasons enough for enquiring about  some money back. I would be gladly to get an answer from you. Faithfully, Bergut Hunrtner  [SEP]  What will we wear 100 years from now? Fashion changed every year. Do you remember what people wore 100 years ago? And by the way do you believe that they also thought the fashion never changed? But the fashion changed. 100 years ago the people wore long clothes and large robes. You can say they wore a lot of clothes at one time. Nowaday people wear lesser clothes. Often you causes very litte and short robes and tops. Often you show your skin because its popular  and everyone do it. So it's possible to wear nothing in the future. A lot of thinks will be easier to do. But in the winter there's still a problem which is to solve. In the winter you'll freeze. But this problem is solving by itselfes. The sommers and winters get warmer. The season for this is the global warming, which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible. But by some situations you have to wear something. The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special kind of producing. So don't laugh about this idea. Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it. It's possible. ",21.0
1042," Dear Mr Robertson: Firstly, I'm very glad to hear from you. Thank you for being organised the programme for our class, I think you may think about a long time that how shall we study during  three days. We have seen your programme, and like all of those , especially the Science Museum, it will  good for us to increase our knowledge, and so on. Secondly, I wonder if you know it will have ""London fashion and Leisure "" be showed on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will introduce, is most interested in us, I mean it's conflict with your plan, what a pity! All of us want to go to the show, the generation who are the same ago with us all like make up, become beautiful, and it's important that it will  free for students and just be showed  one day. So, we don't want lose this chance. Finally, we would like to get your permition to go, maybe if it is possible that you  change your programme, we may be going to your college any time after Tuesday. We're sorry to give you trouble. We look forward to hearing from you again as soon as possible. Best Wishes  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. This story happed two years ago. That was a very hot summer, every people in our city like to swim in the river, perhaps they didn't think it was interesting if they swimed in the pool. Personally, I'd like to say I was good at swimming. Not only I was a member of  swimming team in our school, but also I was tought by my father since I was five years old, So I would understood some skills and  how to protect yourself from my Dad, if you had a accident. One day, I passed by a river in accident, I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river. Suddenly, I heard  of ""help, help"" in my distance. In a while, lots of passed-by crowed to the river-side. To my surprise, nobody want  to save that boy who was shouting,  just stood there, like lots of ""champ"". I started think about it, after all, either had I neve done this task before, or trained. I  just 15 years old. Finally, I jumped into the river, I really knew that was dangerous, but I haven't think about anything except ""justify"" this word. I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time. Thank goodness, I succeed,  save that struggled child. When I went the river-side bank, I saw some red-faced. ",22.00
504," Dear Sir: I am writing to let you know  the disappointed evening I had seen your show with the worst services I have ever seen. First of all, in the ticket for entrance  says that the actor was Danny Brook and realy he was not. In the show apears a different actor, so I was very disappointed. Then, in the ticket  says that the show started at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very unpolited of your side, and also,  make me lose time. Other thing is that in the ticket  apears that discounts were available but when I asked for it, there was no one. The last thing is that you invited us to visit your restaurant after the show, but it was closed because the food was not already done. I thought you were a good theatre, were people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but realy I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back. I'll never return again because of the bad service you ofer. Please, let me know your answer. Truely.  [SEP]  All of us know the technology and science has affected our lives.

893," Dear Helen Ryan. I am writing to reply  your letter about my first prize in your competition and give you all  information for my two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I  prefer travelling in July, because it will be my school vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during school times. It'd be great if I could be accommodated in  tents, because I've never slept in  tents before, and I think it is an interesting experience. Secondly, the two activities wich I'd like to pratice during the campsite are sailing and surfing. I have already surfed when I was travelling in Brazil, but since them I have hadn't a chance to do it again. Although I know how surfing, I have no idea about sailing, I just only read about it and I am very interested  to practice. Is there any problem? I'd like to ask you some questions: Is  necessary bring  money to the Camp? How much? And about clothes? What is more appropiated? Finally, I want to thank you for the great opportunity I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely. Camila Beatriz de J. Branco  [SEP]  A programme  not often good. Shopping is said that an enjoyable programme in all situations. However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be. When you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant. The problem is find a shop assistant who hear  your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times  isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash. So you had lost hours to buy nothing. You can't talk to  manager even to give him suggestions  to improve his business, because he is always absent. And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you. To conclude, although you can have good moments while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, isn't it? ",29.0

Secondly Discounts did not availabe. Even though I brought  discount taken which I was given by  travel agency. What's more, the theatre reastaurant had been closed, when the show finished. Because the show started  20:15. It should have started at 19:30 as you said at  advertisement, or you should not have closed  before the show finished. It was not  perfect evening whatoever.

196," Dear Manager, Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at the Circle Theathre. That is why I am writing this letter; to inform you about the problems I had. First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts to students, but at the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me a full price. The day of the show, we got to the theather at 19:30. Instead, due to some technical problems, it began at 20:15. Second, I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook, the best actor I have never known and the reason for which I decided to see the show, was not going to be performing. Third, the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up. I was really looking forward to eating at that place. In conclusion, I would appreciate  if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. Sally, her best friend, had told her what had been happening at her house for the last two months. Pat knew something was wrong because she had known Sally since they were five years old, but she did not  why she was acting so strange. Sally did not want to tell anybody about her problem, but she knew she could trust Pat. So Sally started to talk. She had seen her stepfather hitting her mother everytime he was drunk. She didn't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather find out about that, he would get made and hit her, or even worse, kill her mother. However, she needed to tell somebody. One morning somebody knocked at the door at Sally's house. It was the police. Sally was so scared, and at the same time mad at Pat because she knew the only person who could have told the police was her best friend. But she knew that Pat did it because she loved her and was afraid something horrible could have happened to her or to her mother. ",33.0
435," Dear Sir or Madam, Unfortunatelly I have to complained about  musical show  in your's Circle Theatre last evening. When I become your's advertisment concerning the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I thought that I'll have a great evening, but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I start for the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend. The show had a 45 minutes delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts, whot kind of discounts? I haven't seen any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to paid a full-prize for his ticket. Becouse the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your's theatre restaurants was closed because of  holiday. Hereby I have to ask for  money back or another discounts for me. Waiting for you replay. With best regards  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The stay has begaun last year, when I stated my summer holiday. I had not any money for travelling but my parents were able to give me them if I only had a concret plans. I started talking with my parents that I will be travelling with my friends through West-Europe for one month. I had really a good plan but any good friends. I become quite a lot of money and I left home. During one week I was really travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on a railway-stations or under a bridges. After one mounth I came home back and explained my parents how a lot of fun had I with my friends - I don't know why I was such a lair. My parents belived my word's untill my younger brother Pat told them the true. Now my parents' don't belive my words. But I think, this was a good lesson for me and I  lair any more. ",23.0
481," Dear Sir, My name is ***. Recently I spent a week's holiday in London. read the advertisement and I found it interesting so I though that it would be nice to spent one of the nights I had in London at your musical show. But I was completely wrong. It was an awful experience. I had come with two friends on the 21st  August, and one of the reasons was that we were big fans of Danny Brook and we were looking forward to watch his show. You can imagine  disappointing  was to find out that he was replaced by another actor   not so popular. We were there at 19:15 as the show was starting at 19:30 for getting our tickets. We asked for the discounts you were refering at your advertisement but  the counter  told us that they were not available because it was Sunday. That was terrible but we didn't want to make a big deal of it so we went inside and waiting. The show started forty-five minutes later. We got really bored waiting. After the show had finished we went for dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the owner was ill. From all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening. was We are asking you to return our money. Hope you'll understand Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. From the time she was a child she couldn't keep anything for herself, she always shared her thoughts with other people She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family. She went to a new school and she had no friends. She was not very sociable and she could not create relationships very easily. By the time she became close friend with Kim, who was really strange to  other students and everybody disliked her. Pat was wondering why and one day she found out. Kim explained  her that she kept the distance from the other students because her father was in prison and  didn't want no one to find out. Pat Kept this a secret for two months but one day told it by accident to a boy from her class. In a few days all  school was familiar with Kim's story. Kim was terrified because everyone was making fun on her and   very angry with Pat. Pat had to make  up . She had to find a way to make Kim forgive her. She had found the perfect way. She stand up infront of the whole classroom and explained that Kim's father actions didn't influence Kim. That she was a great friend to her and if someone owed to be punished that was her. Kim forgave her and all the students understand how wrong they were and were very sorry. They  all got to know the real Kim know. ",37.0
486," 17th - June - 2000 Auda. Lolas 44 MADRID 23456 SPAIN Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the show ""Over the rainbow"" taking part  the 15th of June The last week I have been to London for a holiday. There is saw the advertisement for this show and I decided to go there. I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible. In the advertisement you told me I would have  discounts. This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I was waiting fourty five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. When it started the main actor Danny Brook was not in , another worse actor was taken his part. In my opinion when the main actor can not do the show it is better not do the show than do it with a horrible actor. When it finished I arrived at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they are going to do a new better restaurant. In my opinion you should refuse my money because the evening and the show were so terrible. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I have fell in love with Paul a friend of us. No one know it else her. The wendsday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also love Paul. I had also told Sally my secret. The thursday Sally phoned me, because we are also friends, but she did not tell me anything about Paul. The weekend started and this Friday we went to the dyscoteque. I spent there a good time but at the end , when we were going to come back home, I saw Sally kissing Paul!! It was terrible!! When Sally came out  the dyscotheque I was very nervous and I started to shout  her. She hit me and I decided in this moment that I never should speak with her . Paul ask Pat what had happened and she told him my secret. One friend of mine told me that Pat had told Paul my secret and I went to speak with her. Now we are friends but I know that I can not tell her any secret. ",23.0
389," Dear Sir, I write this letter because I find there were too many problems concerning your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". At first, I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor, but she must have been changed since the actor was different. I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre. Nevertheless, I stayed since I had paid. I also want to put the stress on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm. It is a really a shame! In fact, if I had knowned, I would have probably stayed at home. We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available. Nonetheless, there were no discounts available at all. And, we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant in so far as it was closed. Indeed, there was a little paper on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness. Consequently I ask you for some money back seeing that I think: it's not worth the bother to loose money for such a show., Thank you.  [SEP]  I think that modern technology change my daily life. Indeed, daily life is easier thanks to technology. For example, if I want to buy something, I have to go on my computer and buy it. But it will make me lazy. On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we've got more and more possibilities to enjoy ourselves since she invents a lot of products. But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes cheap and I can't afford it. In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it hadn't existed since there are too many things on  market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different marks. And it's all the more tyring since you often wait during two weeks before buying it. I'm bound to feel nervous. To put it in a nutshell, I would like to say that technology can be a good thing, but it creates many problems too. ",27.0
165," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you in order to complain for the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; concretely on Friday evening. First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion about your company, which is said to be the best exhibitor of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended  the referred day to your theatre with the aim of having a perfect evening. However, nothing was further from what really happened. In the beginning, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started. And finally, when it went on, we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing. I hope you realise this was totally different from what you advertised, and I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future offering me some money back. Yours faithfully, Jaro Santoquez  [SEP]  Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in. Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily life had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished looking  how our lifes are changing frenetically. We have hardly assimilated a new technology when it is replaced or modified by another. Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily life more comfortable and easier, but does it means that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free-time. However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stopping race. Machines do now most of  hard work, but this does not mean that we are working less. People spend more and more time working, searching for new inventions that will make life easier, but then fail to profit  all the obtained benefits. ",33.0
53," Dear Mr/Mrs, I've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to it. I must say that  International Arts Festival is really  great idea. And your last festival was very intresting too. But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful. First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there are people only from six countries. I think it can make your festival more popular. Jazz, rock and classical concerts are amazing, but I think that some concert halls are too small, so not everybody can come. Your dance shows are very beautiful,  art exhibitions is something original and exciting. And also it is very interesting to talk with writers. I think that one reasonably-priced weekend  for all events is  exellent idea because it isn't so Expensive as buying  ticket to each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue to making your festivals. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tom, How are you? Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting. The question you asked me in it is very original too. I must say that  rules aren't  same in  schools of our country. Every school has it's own rules. I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students. We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem. So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers. I'm allowed to do many things at home. My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right. And the main reason Why our family is so friendly, it's because we haven't go many rules. So, I think there isn't something I'd like to change. I hope everything is good in your family and your school. Take care, ",23.00

I would like to travel in July because I have an important exam in September. Plus, it may be lovely weather at that time in  U.S.A. I would prefer log cabins. To tell the truth, I want to stay in both, but I have never stayed in log cabins before, so I would try  new style for me! I would like to choose singing and tennis. I used to go to KARAOKE with my meats in Japan as I really like to do that, anytime. On the other hand, I have played tennis for nearly 7 years and it is also one of my hobbies. If possible, could you please let me know information about the way of getting there, e.g. airport information?? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim Hello, Kim! It's been ages to write letters to you. How was your exam? I believe it went well! By the way, last month I was in that pop concert which you mentioned in your last letters. Can you believe it? Actually I helped and support to sell tickets at the reception. I've sold tickets before but not in that kind of big pop concert. Before it was packed into by  audience, we had to clean around the reception, but totally it was really exciting although I was just a  staff in the small reception, because I felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queing. I liked that especially. I don't like to tidy up, you know!! I like to face people whom even I don't know. Foremost, after finishing my work, I could meet singers by chance!! That night was brilliant and class! I keep that in my mind,  ever! Anyway, hope to hear from you shortly. See you. Love From ",24.0
1207," Dear Mrs. Smith, In reply to your letter, I would like to answer your questions and give you more information. Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is  'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and  no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party would be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you could wear something quite casual. Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount. I hope this letter should help you with enough information. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Could modern people live without a light bulb? Well, I don't think so. Only people who could live without it, must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation! We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly  happens! Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply. I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in  toilet, all the light was turned off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be, and I was sure I can never, ever live without it. ",34.00
1191," Dear Maria First at all, I am sorry about Richard illness. Please remember me to him and give him my best wishes. About your request, I'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need, however you can call me if you consider it necessary, (my phone number is 2496 9731). Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. Because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it. Moreover, it is really well-located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem. Even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre, which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel. We haven't asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes, although you can come well-dressed, if you feel better . After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce  each others. Finally in my opinion, you should visit the Art Gallery. It will take you two or three hours but it's a gorgeous place. I look forward  hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Sagrada Familia"" a real holly building. If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona, which you can like whatever your tastes are, you should visit the ""Sagrada Familia"". Among the big number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art. Gaudi conceived  this church n 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it. Since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again. After Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later. Nowadays, a hard work is being done in order to finish  as soon as possible. The visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit. There is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted. And, unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top. There you can enjoy a terrific view, not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building. ",34.00
1074," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to your about the trip in London. Thanks for your programme, we are all looking forwards especially for the Monday 13 March because we will discover all the monument in London. However, we have got a suggestion: we saw an advertissement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00. For all of us, it sound like a great opportunity because we though that this event would makes us learn about the way of life in London,  the english style.... Moreover, the big advantage is that it is a free show so you will not have to worry about the budget. Our request is to change the programme, either you can cancel all the Tuesday and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you cannot cancel the Museum, we can go there right after because we will have full of time to  shopping during our free time on Wednesday.  Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very exciting. thanks in advance Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Since always, medias has been keen of famous people life and it's becoming worst and worst, you can find everything in ""gossip"" Newspapers. Does famous people deserve to keep their own life secret? According to me, you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when  to start you career you know that  medias will be hunting you everywhere and  more famous you get  worst it is going to be because that  the life style people wants to know everything , for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they saw them many time on T.V. or   Cinema, So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself. therefore, even if I agree sometimes  Medias are going too far and write really bad things. if you're famous you cannot have  private life because all of this is a part of their job. And if  Medias are too awful they have got  law to protect themself. ",28.00
71," Dear J. Clark, I'm writing in response to your advertisement about the annual international arts festival. I really think it was a great idea to organize such a festival in our city as there are lots of people fond of art over here. I'm sure they are all very grateful to you now. I've already been to the festival and I think it's really important to let people see artists from all over the world. It would be wonderful if there were stars from more than six countries next year, the festival would be even more interesting then. I also think the places you have chosen for the classical concerts were not good sometimes, some of the halls seemed to be too small. But your idea about the weekend ticket is just excellent, people from the whole country get the opportunity to visit your festival and see all the events you are offering. I've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival. You could probably show a little bit more films and interviews with the most interesting artists. I'm sure it would attract lots of young people. Well, thank you very much for this festival, my friends and I have enjoyed it a lot. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Dave, Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you. Howe are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk bout our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow. Hope it will be interesting for you. Bu the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teaches don't let us smoke of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest. We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teaches. As for our rules at home, it's always different and depends just on your family. My parents are not very strict as you know and I appreciate them for giving me freedom. They understand that I can make my own decisions, but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother nay time we need it. I think the only rule in my house is to care bout each other. I hope to hear from you soon ",38.00

And it is free for students! If you don't mind, we'd like to change the programme a little bit. Instead of shopping on Tuesday afternoon we'd like to go to this show, which will continue till 7 o'clock in the evening. We all expect the trip to London to be exiting and hope to get unforgettable memories Best regards your students  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Our life is changing every day. New technological inventions bring us new cars, new planes, new houses. Future is almost unpredictable. But what if we'll try to imagine how our house will look like in the next 50 or 100 years? Will we all live in  countryside in house surrounded by forest full of animal life? Or would be our house itself alive? With new computer technology nothing is impossible. The scintist could invent the 4'th dimention and we'll get unlimited space inside the house. It is already predictable, that very soon all house appliances will be voice controlled. You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you'd like to wear, your hob will cook your preferable meals and your refigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food. Lots of changes could be done in the future, but the main purpose of the house - to keep comfort and safety, to place for you to relax and feel at home, - will remain. ",30.00
133," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show I saw in your theatre a week ago. Although the show was supposed to be the London's newest and best musical show, I am rather disappointed with it. Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage. However, you changed actors without informing  viewers. As if this were not enough, the show was forty five minutes late. Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject. According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused being given a discount. On top of everything, the theatre restaurant was closed. You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening. I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further. I look forward to receiving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Recently, we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones,  internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through  internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients. However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing  computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon cars from city centres,  closed down factories which produce too much sewage. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably. ",34.0
302," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show, ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" a few days ago. I am writing this letter to tell you how I felt disappointed with it. There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show. With the advertisement, you mentioned Mr. Danny Brook and Ms. Tina Truelove were going to play but actually different people were playing, whom I have never seen before. And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it was not started until 20:15. To make it worse, neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available. According to the owener of the restaurant, it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off. As I am writing, it was not a perfect evening at all but horrible, so I would like to ask for  money back and compensate for my special 20th birthday. I am waiting for your reply as soon as possible.  Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Fashion Of the Future There have been already a variety of fashion style nowadays. Some are in formal others are in casual. Especially in big cities such as London, New York and Tokyo, you can see a lot of people in various clothes, so I do not think there will be such big differences in  outlooking of clothes even 100 years from now. However, I think, there will be some diffences in  quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made in especially swimming costumes and athletes' costumes for  Olympic. In addition, I think the earth will be warmer and warmer than now and 100 year from now will be an Area of Space. So clothes for space will be necessary and clothes for warmer climates will be necessary. In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think,  better quality in clothes will be created in every field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space. although  outlooking such as, shape and color will not be changed so much in fashion.

876," Dear Mr Ryan. Thanks for you letter. I am so exciting that I have won the first prize. I will give you all  information you need and ask some questions. I could only travel on July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is  summer holiday. But I have booked a flight to home at the beginning of Auguest. And also I would like to go on summer. The accommodation I would like to live in tents. Because I never live in  tents before. I think it is great and I want to try it. I like doing sports. I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp. I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college term. But I am not very good at golf. And also I want to ask some questions. What clothes should I taken? How much money should I taken? And how could we meet at the airport? I am looking forward  your reply. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  As our class is going to mark a short video about daily life at college, I write this report to suggest some lessons and activities which should be filmed. 1. English lesson. Because all students in  English class are from all over the world. We can talk  everybody's feeling  living and study at a foreign country. 2. Computing lesson and computer room. Nowdays  internet makes us closer and closer. We can get all what we want on  internet. It's one of the most important things in our life now. 3. Liabrary. We not only borrow books from  liabrary but also study at  liabrary. Library is very important in our daily life. 4. Canteen. Everyday we go to  canteen have lunch, no matter  you bought food from there or you take your own food. 5. Football. What do you do after class? Joging or doing some sports? You can't forget football. These are what I think should be filmed. If any of you have other suggestion, we can discuss  again. But I think these five lesson or activities are  most common in our daily life at college. ",24.0
1195," Dear Mrs Smith I am writing to answer your letter about the details of  international students conference.  Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is  North City Line,  is  yellow line on the map. After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station which is for twenty minutes,  is in front of the conference . The conference which will be held from 1 pm through 4 pm, is a formal party. You should wear formal clothes, and are going to play a game and enjoy  welcome drink together. Before catching our plane, we will be able to enjoy going shopping around the airport for three hours in the afternoon. Because there are so many unique shops and you should buy good gifts for your parents Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mr Wolf I am writing to answer your question about the information on an interesting building to visit. I would like to introduce one building in my town. ""Sky Heaven"" which is the name of the building, is for fifteen minutes from the centre of my town. This building have a hundred floor and it takes for five minutes  from the grand to the top in the elevator. There are many facilities which are a museum, a exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping. The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world. You should get  the top of the building and experience such a amazing view. Another reason is that there is a good museum, which tell you about the history of my town so easily and clearly. It is a good experience for your students. I hope you will accept my recommendation and am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  ",26.00
70," Dear Sir, First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea. I enjoyed it and found  worthy to visit. The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with the stars and artist coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get used to more cultures by inviting  from some other countries too. The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in. So I could hardly participated in all of the concerts. The organisation was very good I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year. It was really a reasonably-priced weekend for me, but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs,  drawing a portrate next year. Then it would be excellent. Thanks for everything. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, I have received your letter. It is nice to hear from you again. I'm in a hurry, so I will directly come to the point. Everywhere and  everytime in our lives we face with the rules. Some find them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them. For me they are both. At schools we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk. I think these are international rules which help things to go in order. Contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and  feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in   wearing. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class. They don't care if we have problems, exams to study  or if we are ill. At homes we have again rules, but more flexible ones. You should be punctual when coming to  dining table, respectful, do your home works and watch TV less and not too loud. I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have the enough power. They are against democracy I think. Anyway hope to hear from you soon. With all my love, ",33.00
637," Austria, 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I refer to your letter in which you informed me that I have won the first prise in the competition. You asked me for some further information and hear are my ""desirs"": I would like to travel only in July because in August I have to study for an exam. Further I would prefer to live in a tent at the Camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spent my holidays in tents. I would like to do painting, because one of my greatest hobbies is silk-painting and so I think I can improve my abilities. The second activity, which I choose is playing basketball, because I love this wonderful sport. We always play it at school and I am very good at it. I am in our school-basketball-team. I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you which clothes and how much money I should bring with me. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Austria, 13th June 200 Dear Kim, I hope you are fine. You know, last month I helped at a pop concert and I am sure you want to know some details. My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears. I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets. Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both ! I had to tell one of them, that she had to leave. She started crying. Such a poor girl. At this moment I didn't like my position. My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect ""dangerous"" items, I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags. This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it. Summing up I can say that it was a fantastic day, because Britney sang so beautiful and the performance was also super. I hope you can imagine how a wonderful day it was for me. Yours ",31.0
8," Dear Clark, I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival.' First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year. To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries. Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining. Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year. Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp  a whole weekend for a cheap price. To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year. In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  How can you earn money in your spare time? I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work. A traditional way to earn money, in the spare time, is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything get wet. Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs. But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at  you'll also earn some money. Okay don't wait, there where you're good at and begin. ",34.00
1102," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you concerning the London trip that my English class is going to do in March. First of all I want to thank you for the good programme that you mack for my class in such a short time. The students are especially very happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to do on tuesday morning of 14th March. The point of my letter is that  students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and they would appreciate  if they could go and see the show. The show is going to include  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles and best of all it is free for students to get in. The only problem is that the show is going to take place on tuesday of 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes in your programme. My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be showed. We suggest to swop shopping on tuesday and free time on Wednesday, so we can see the show on tuesday afternoon. I'll hope that this matter doesn't going to cause you any problems and we hope for an answer as soon as possible. Thank you  [SEP]  The home of the Futere In what ways do you think people's homes will be different in the future? That is the question, which many people ask themselves and other people quite often. The technologi is changing very fast and at the same moment as I'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new owen which co-operate with your refrigerator and has in the programme to make dinner for you every day without that you have to do anything. What about rooms which can feel your mood and acting after that, if you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing musik on and turn down the light a little bit. Next step might be a robot, which would do all your housework, but what would happened to the people? I think that everyone should not think just about the positive sides with technologi but also the negative. The technologi is good as long as it gives people more free time, but what would happened if freetime became your life? ",28.00
666," Dear Helen Ryan, I'm writing to you with regard to the letter I've just received as I wish to give you some further information about myself. I would rather travel on July because I'm not as busy as on June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather. Regarding the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep  and they aren't very cozy. Regarding the activities I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, but I expect the water to be as crystal clear. I've also chosen singing. I'm an awful singer, but I would like to learn. I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very extrict vegan, and to suggest me what kind of clothes to bring. I'm really looking forward to my stay at Camp California and to your response in this regard. Yours sincerely, Nuria Valverde.  [SEP]  Have you ever asked yourself which lessons or activities should be filmed in the school video? Well, I've just polled some students and here are their responses. 70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because  is one of the lessons they enjoy the most. The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun. 60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video  they can also have fun at school. Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring. In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because  is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it. But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows how breaks are  and what students do during them. In a nutchel I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed. Nuria Valverde. ",32.0

I would like to sing and  photograph, I've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it. In the other hand, I can not sing very well but I would like to do this  there. I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there, would you check the weather forecast for me, please? And how much money I am going to need to have there with me?

Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money? I started to look in everywhere. I've asked my mom and my friends and everybody didn't know where it was. My mom said: 'You've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.' I started to look for my wallet and I couldn't find it, lighter. Now I was without my money and my wallet. What could I do? Suddenly the door bell rang. I went to see who was there. It was and old woman asking who was Maria. 'It's me!' I said.

1073," Dear Mr. Robertson I am a student from your class and I would like to thank you first of all. It's a good programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show. That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00. They show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear ands something for the women: make up and hairstyle trends. That show is free for students, so it's also a big advantage. We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing. I know that it is a change. But I have thought about it. On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich. Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime. I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge, as well. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Who would like to be famous? Are you dreaming of being a Star? It must be wonderful when you have a lot of money and everybody seems to know you. Really? I think the main problem is that you would lose your private life. That's the price you have to pay nowadays. But you need all the journalists to become famous so the only way is to accept that there are journalists and that they are just doing their job. No one told you to be famous. If you are famous it was your choice and therefore  is a price  to pay. Of course you have fame and poverty. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on the street. To sum up I think, if you  well-known you have to deal with that. There's no other way. Everone knows you because of the journalists so  can't just ignore them, can you? ",30.00

Although Tina Truelove was there, I went to the theatre to see Danny Brook. Another problem I had was  the time . I was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining. I'd like to explain too that I didn't see that you made  discounts to no one. I was queuing for a long time and I didn't see it . And I went with a lot of friends and we didn't have any discount. Another question is that in the advertisement you advised we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we couldn't do it. And we were very hungry after being three hours in the theatre. And that are all  problems I found. And, because of these faults, I'd like to have my money back. If you don't mind, of course. Yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I met Pat when we were children. We went at the same school and  at the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say it to him. When we finished  our primary school we went at the same secundary school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every weekends. And when we finished  the secundary school, I decided go to a foreign University. I spend five years there, although I came  all summers and we continued going out as we did before. When I finished I return to my city to find a job. A day, Pat told me that we was talking with this boy and that he told her that I like him and immediately she told him that he liked me too. A week after that I found him in a coffee and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted. Now, five years later we are going to get married. ",26.0
38," Dear Jane Clark I went  the international arts festival which you organized. Most of the events were good, but I felt that the festival could be even better next year. So, may I give you my suggestions and opinions? I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea! But the stars and artists who are from around the world were from only six countries. You had better invite more nationarities' people. And some concert halls were too small, so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films in the next year than this year's. I think the idea of one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent! Because it does not complex, also we don't confuse. If you can improve these points, your festival must be better than this year's. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Johnny Thank you for your letter. Anyway, you want to know about rules at home and school in my country, don't you? My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed  many things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes  whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom in any time . Of course we can go out  the classroom in any time. But some schools in my country don't allow many things. One of the rules of my friend's school is not to drink and eat something during a class. And the students have to wear the uniforms, so they can't chose their clothes. Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back  my house until 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule! I really want to change this rule. Many of my friends have this rule. How about in your country? Love ",26.00

The girls are interesting more than boys, For make up and hairstyle. and they want to know all the latest news about these .

Private life is very important to anyone, because your job create you stress and you should rest, charge your batteries For the next day. If journalists  following you step by step  is difficult to have a private life. On the other hand. I believe that Journalists  doing their work, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and  always. Following the Famous people in order to discover something new of their lifes. Another thing is the pressure. From media owners and the difficulty For someone to Find  job in our days. Media owners want to maximize their profits and always press the journalists to Find something new. To conclude journalists should doing their work but without annoyance to the other people.

But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see it, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time. And sometimes the credit card machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of your credit card. Another bad thing is that people want something very badly, and they can't afford it. That makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy theirselves. ",36.0

Could you answer my questions please as soon as you can, because I'm nervous, and I need your soon answer, and I will have  talk with my parents about  camp. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays, the people are always buying anythings  maybe they don't need this things,  only buy  because  is in fashion. In the first place, when the people think only in go to the shopping  forgot others things: play with their children, talk with than parents, friends. In the other hands, when the people go to shopping  spend a lot of money. I my view,  is more enjoyable do others things than go to shopping because, maybe ""you lose your money"". ",19.0
1105," Dear Mr Robertson, I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visiting London. I have read the programme and I find it very appealing, specially because of the River trip to Greenwich. However, I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I was wondering if we could visit it. The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall  the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. There will be shown the latest fashions, leisure and sportwear, some make up and also different hairstyles. The students are  free so we won't have to pay for the visit. We all think this is a great opportunity to learn more about London daily life and what people like to wear. I suggest visiting the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday morning and visit the Science Museum on Friday afternoon. We all hope you would consider our suggestion. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Almost everyone hates other people gossip in their private things. It's a natural reaccion to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping  and bothering your personal thoughts. So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or films stars don't deserve being followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time. I thing that  journalit's only aim is money, be cause they know that if they publish famous people's private life they would earn lot's of money selling the magazine or the newspaper. But they don't consider the problems the romours may bring to the famous family or couple. Sometimes the journalit's aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil the politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous. In conclusion, no matter which or what the journalit's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private life just as normal people have. ",26.00
917," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan Yesterday, I received your letter. It made me happy and I would like to than you for the opportunity you offer me First of all I would like to travel in July. I think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to California. This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. About the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen is swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough t this sector. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm intrested in this sport even if I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action. As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the cloths I must take with . Please drop me a line Yours sincierly  [SEP]  Dear Kim Yesterday I received your letter and it made me happy that you and your family are healthy. As you asked me I will write  you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough. Before the concert I helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert. It was really a very beautiful experience. It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too. In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and have a lot of autogrammes by them. I will never forget these days and for sure I will take part in activities like this in the future. Yours faithfully Alexander. ",32.0
1000," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan With reference to the letter from you. I would like to inform  some further information as follow. First of all, I am able to joy the camp only in July because then will be my school holiday. I would prefer tents to long cabins because I think it will be more interesting and exciting than live in long cabins. I am also interested in swimming and sailing, I am always go to  swimming pool when I have time, our family used to live near the sea side, we would go sailing on the weekend and I miss it very much Finally, I don't know much about there, is there anything should I bring with me? What is the weather going to be like? Because I want to know what kind of clothes should I bring with me? And how much meney should I have? I look forward to hearing from you. yours sincerely RATTANAKOSIN AREVA  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining way. Some people when they are in a sadness, they will go shopping to forget every thing and the fact is that every body knows how to shopping. If you have chilldren, you will know it very well  when you are busy doing something and the chilldren see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometime they even cry or shout to you and it is really anoy you. However they are happy after they have it. Anyway, even in families they usauly have this problem that when they bought a new one, suddenly they have a problem that where the old one is going to be and that is the begining of  argument between mother and farther or parents and chilldren. Eventually I like shopping to and I beleive every body like shopping, but before you buy something think before  you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough meney for survive.

6," Dear Mr Jane Clark, My name is Rosa Santor. I'm 24 and I'm  student from Poland. I study architecture at the Polytechnics in Krakow. I'm very interested in art, specially in paintings and goings to galleries. I'm writting you a letter, because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival. I recently spent two days at this festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that  festival could be even better next year. It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion if this is an international festival, it would has more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like it was this year. It was  great idea for doing something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hall were too small for all  people, who took a part at that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also  a great idea was, that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. I think, as a person, who in this festival took place in, that this is excellent, because we can spend a lot of time with art. There is only one bad fhing, that this festival was too short. In my opinion next year it should take place  much longer than two days. I'm not looking foward to received  letter from you, because I know, that you are busy, but please look at my suggestion for next year's festival. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear Kathleen, I've been just receiving this letter for you, so I'm writting  you. I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years. You wrote that in your class, you've been talking about rules, both at home and at school. So now, I would like you write something about  school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. As you know I'm not a secondary school's student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Sathurday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there are a lot of drawings,  paintings and some other subjects doing by hands. We also learn how to design the interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons at the morning, till  afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all  class, for example next to the lake, and there we are paintings the nature. I don't have troubbles with my education, my friends and teachers are nice and friendly, but there is one thing I'd like to change in my school. I'd like to have more tests during the whole study, not only at the end, because it causes that I'm getting very lasy. I'm looking forward to received a new letter from you. I think, that you don't forget, & will write  me soon. See you soon, your best friend ",25.00
1136," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all, I want to thank you in the name of the class for your good organisation and programme,  Especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time. We really appreciate this. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from 10 oo to 19 oo o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall. There will be shown the latest fashions about leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't been ever before in this kind of show. As well as this, the entrance for students is free. As you can see this is the best time to go there. We have some suggestions about how to change the programme. Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something. To sum up, this is a really great opportunity for us and I don't think that the changes are so big. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  The man is a being that need to live close to other human beings and to create a society around him. As well as this he needs his own free space and privacy. This is also  important to him as friendship and family In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press. Just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The yellow press is searching for every little  information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people, just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat. The photos will be on tomorrow's press and so rumours are born. On the other hand the people have choose to walk on this path. Everything in life has a price. The price for fame and money is the lost of privacy. First of all you have to give up something for getting something else. However, the press shouldn't create rumours and hunt those people like animals. As well as this, the stars shouldn't complaint at any time about their fans and their lost of privacy. They wanted to be famous and the had known the price before. The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous. ",35.00
113," Manager of the Circle Theatre 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show ""over the Rainbow"" you presented  the 10 of this month. I read your advertissement five days before, and I was realy impressed by it. But, the quality of this show wasn't what you let understand, an I feel realy disappointed by it. I want to give you some details about my feelings. First of all, you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late. Then, I am a student, and when I bought my ticket, there wasn't any discounts. Finally, I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make my totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00. So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending ""Perfect Evening"". For all these reasons, and if you want to keep me  a costumer, I would be gratfull if you give me some or all  my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My marks wasn't good enought to obtain my degree in Computer Science, and the exam session was finished. There was no solutions to finally obtain the diploma. You need more explanations about me to understand my motivations at the end of this story. In fact, I did this kind of studies because of my interests in programming. The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam to succeed. That's why I decided to hack  the teacher's computers to change all my marks. I never talked about this project to anyone, exept my best friend Pat. At the end of the exam session, all students and teachers meet together for a big party, to celebrate it. During this party, Pat drank too much. And when he was totally drunk, he started speaking. Then, the teachers made copies of their file, and my project wasn't possible anymore. So congratulation everybody. And I think I will still be there next year. ",23.0
1037," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you liked it. We are very grateful to you for these three days that we are going to spend in the English capital, especially because you planned very interesting and different kinds of things to do for all  us. However, all we agree that we would like to introduce a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show in the Central Exhibition Hall of London in the trip organisation. I am sure that, if you allow us to go, we are going to enjoy it a lot, to learn new topics about the English culture and have an opportunity to communicate ourselves with all those professional of the fashion. It is a very good chance to join this exhibition to see all the new fashion tendences, the latest hairstyles and make up as all  we came from many different countries and have not the same customs either. And another important thing to consider is that for the students the tickets are free. As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of doing shopping in the afternoon. By this way, we would visit the museum as you had planned and n Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished it. Well, that is all I wanted to tell you. We do hope you like our suggestion and we can have an agreement to join the fashion exhibition. Yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  Do famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time? Some people think that they should. They are human beings actually and they need to keep a little bit of pirvacity and freedom in their lifes to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymus and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to go out home  not to be recognised.. This is supposed to make them happier... Nevertheless, if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of the people, if they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity, a popularity which has given to them by all us. So they need to become famous to be what they want and if the people don't know them, they are forgotten, they die... To sum up I would like to say that for me  is very difficult  which group has the reason but, by the moment, we should try to respect each other and go in the other's soul to feel like them in those moments we cannot understand them.

460," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Having seen with two of my friends your musical show last week-end at The Circle Theatre which  called ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", I am writing to complain about our disappointing evening. First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'tickets student price'. Despite being forced to buy adult tickets, we still were excited and took our seat, and waited for the beginning of the show. Usually, the show starts at 19:30, but this time we had to wait until 20:15! In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement , so we were disappointed. Concerning the restaurant, it was closed due to transformations. In the result, I am sure you will understand our annoyed and frustrated, so it was not a perfect evening out that your advertisement stated  was. Finally, I am writing to request a full-refund for my friends and I, because I felt your advertisement was misleading. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, H. Boulard  [SEP]  What do you think about what will clothes be like in the future? I'm sure that anyone has already thought about it, because fashionable clothes have always been really important for almost all of us. Let's have a look at different points. From the past until now, we have  wearing several different  fashionable clothes, but why? From my point of view, almost all humans would like to be more and more attractive, so we always think about it. As a result, clothes are the easiest way to be more attractive. In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever. Furthermore, it's one of the best way to make money. Anyway, don't you think that nowadays, fashionable clothes is quite similar than  20 years ago? It's evident that whatever we wear look like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid. We can't wearing peculiar clothes like in science fiction films. I bet you that in 100 years, humans will  wearing exactly the same clothes as today, because we love the actually fashion of clothes which is wonderful. The last survey about fashion shown that people feel really comfortable with those now! ",28.0
1060," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days, during our stay in London, and would like to thank you. Firstly, the whole class is very pleased with the programme, especially with the visit to the National Art Gallery. As we have been told, there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures  in which we all are keen to see it. A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion, that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London,  Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine and there is free entry for students. The show includes the latest fashion wear, sports wear for spare time, make up and hairstyles. At the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study ""Art and Design"" next year. We agreed in the class  to visit this show on Tuesday 14 March in the afternoon after lunch instead of  shopping. Do you think it is possible? We would be grateful, if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To be famous or not to be famous? Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences  like not to have a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just think that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis. On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for. It is the way how they earn money, of course. But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture. For example Lady Diana. Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis? Well, this will be an open question to anyone. ",35.00
145," 17-6-00. Mr. Smith, I write to you because last night, (Saturday 10), I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre. I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets. Furthermore, it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience. After the play, we went to the theatre's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999's spring! How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant? In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't spend the ""perfect evening"" you announce. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Although he had promised Lise that he wouldn't say a word, when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann. Of course, Ann promised not to tell anyone, but by the lunch-break all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams. Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would make all her homeworks during 3 weeks. There was no escape. It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell anything to the teachers, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise. Unfortunately, the perfect plan doesn't exist, and a teacher heard two students talking in the bathroom. The teachers started investigating and asking all the students, but it was a secret and they couldn't say a word. Finally, the teachers asked Lise and her friends. No-one said a word. Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",34.0
1145," Dear Mrs Brown, I am one of your husband's students. My fellow students and I know that your husband has his birthday on Tuesday the 16th of June and we would like to organise a party for him. First of all I would like to suggested  you to come to our party and we would like  not to tell anything to your husband because the party is a surprise. The party will be organised on Tuesday the 16th of June at three to six pm at  college Canteen. We will have food and drink and we will have music because we know that Mr Brown loves music. At the party will come his students, the teachers and the principal. My last question is about  present. My fellow students have suggested to buy a CD or a Book. We would like  to tell us which is the best present for him. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  John said he had some good news to tell me. I didn't beleive him at the first time. But I could se that his face was happy and he didn't tell lies. I stopped talking to my friends and I followed him. We started walking and walking. When we arrived at the bus-station I couldn't understand why he wanted to come there. But I didn't ask him. We wait there for an hour, and I was really angry. I wanted t know why we were there. At that moment we saw the bus to come, it stopped and one man come and sit near of us. I could recognise him. He was my father. I couldn't beleive  I have  to see him for five years. I though that I was dreaming but I wasn't. It was true my father has come at his country after five years. Now all the problems will finish and we will start a new life. ",27.0
221," Matthias Hähnel 104 Mühlenstrasse 09111 Chemnik Germany The manager of the Circle Theatre Dear manager, During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the advertisment you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain  the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how it was told in the advertisment. It was also told that the evening shows are starting  19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also because I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisment. I hope you will answer my letter and correct the problems in your theatre. Yours faithfully Adolf Schmidt  [SEP]  At first you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology'. For me modern technology are things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, Hifi sound systems, television or even cars. But are they are usefull in every situation and everywhere? My oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same problem with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I  got  Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use  his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots. We should also move our body and not only use our brain. ",35.0
415," Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to ""the Circle Theatre"" looking forward to watching your musical ""Over the rainbow"". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-five minutes later. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles with buying a ticket before: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing . This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything   had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced  to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)  [SEP]  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" I heard somebody say ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death. The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping  to the line where the fish is on. The reader feels with him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up. Although this situation might not  very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.  ",37.0
639," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to thank you  to send me all the details about my prize and I'd like to give you a complete information about the journey will be done by myself. I would like to travel at the beginning of the month,  could be between  first and  fifteeth of july, because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip. Related with accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins. Although I like camping and sharing with different kind of people, I'd prefer a confortable and private place (if it's possible) where I can sleep, or be quiet.. I am not a teenager! Really, this prize is wonderful to have a healthy life. I want to do two activities; painting and tennis. The first one is for my mental health, I need a break in my style of life. the second one is just because I'm  fanatic of that sports (really I'm not martine hingis). Eventually, I'd like to request to have  special food, because and vegetarian person, besides I try to eat just organic food. I hope my reply has been suitable. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you doing? It have been a long time since the last time I wrote  you... I'm sorry. However the reason is absolutely amazing. I was training to be a personal assistance to Madonna herself. Maybe, you don't believe me, but it's true. I applied to the job and she selected me between hundreds of candidates (I don't receive  salary). My work is to help her during each concert. You know, she has a brilliant performance where she must change her customs, make up,  scenery, everytime; so she needs a lot of people near. My first job was in the Hillsborough's concert ( I think, you heard about it). I was running all the show, my responsability was to get dress her. I wasn't alone, I worked with a staff of ten people. We had to take of some clothes   and then to put on others ones completly different, in just  few minutes (similar to Formula One). I was exhausted when the concert finished, anyway it has been one of my best experience and I'll remember  for life. Finally, I send you all my positive energy and I am looking forward to receiving your letter back. all the best. ",26.0
685," 8 Jun 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Sir At the begining I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much. I have always dreamt about holidays 'in Camp California' However there are some problems that I hope to solve. First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July. It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down. If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to the nature. I would like You to know also about my two hobbys: swimming and surfing. I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at 'Camp California'. There is also one thing that I would like to ask You about. The question is: Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip? Yours sincerely Anna Nowak  [SEP]  Unconected part of every people lifes is shopping. We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money. As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like  flaing. Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I ought to do is buy and choose. I think that ,,having is a dream'' of all of us. It's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you can't have it. Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present. Everybody know that ,,present presents a problem'' You know your own task but what vith a task of the other person?

852," Dear Ms Ryan I'm writing to reply to your questions about Camp California. First of all, thank you very much for giving me such a good opportunity. I'm very pleased and I'd like to go to the States as soon as possible, however I'm free only in July. Currently I'm studying in England and the school finishes at the end of June. After that I will go back to Japan and continue studying at College, but it stats at the beginning of August. As for the accommodation I would prefer log cabins. I'm not a kind of person who can easily fall a sleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent. At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf. I belonged to a climbing club at my highschool and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practicing centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent of golf. Lastly I'd like to ask you some questions. That is how many and what sort of clothes I need and how much money I should bring. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I think we should follow our time table if we make a video about daily school life, but we cannot film every lessons so I picked up some interesting ones. Firstly we should defnitely put the news review lesson , because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion. Secondly I think the FCE class should be filmed. Most of us (students) came to our school because they wanted to study English, so it should be the important part. In addition if we film the class, people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is. Then why don't we film our lunch time because it is also important, isn't it? I think we should film it at the very crowded moment so that people can see we have to wait patiently before we reach our foods. I think nextly we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class. For the very last part why not filming our faces when all the lessons are finished? ",38.0
605," Dear Ms. Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. I appriciated to this big news. Please, let me tell you my answer now. First, I would like to travel during July. Because my college will finish in the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August. Second, I prefer to stay  a log cabin. I usually stay  a tent during camping. Actually, I don't like tent so much. Therefore, I am interested in staying  a log cabin. Third, I chose painting and golf as activities. I learned painting when I was  school student. Specially, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to  golf club when I went to university in Japan. Finally, I would like you to advise  about clothes and pocket money, which I will take. Thanking you for your time. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is always enjoyable for me. I love shopping. I never feel tired during shopping. Especially, I prefer to go  department stores. They are heaven! I can spend in there all day. In fact, they have many kind of products which make me happy. To be honest, I don't always buy these products but I can be satisfied with just looking  them. Some people doesn't like to go shopping with a friend who takes  long time to decide. Even in this case, shopping is fun for me. I believe there are  lot of why to enjoy shopping. By the way, shopping is a sort of therapy. I sometimes go shopping when I have stress. Shopping helps me to cheer up every time. I think many people, specially women, had  same experience. But the most important things to enjoy shopping is not to use every  money which you have. ",29.0
886," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have recently received your letter informing   I won a two-week-holiday prize at the Camp California. Enclosing  information you asked for, there are some points, I want to point out. First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of the June so I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in  tents  than  log cabins. Since I was a child, I have been intrested in camping and sleeping under the tents. If I can participate on swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful. I have been swimming for 8 years for a club and enjoying  a lot. I am afraid, I am not good at photography but I want to improve it. I need some more information about the camp life and also I would like to know what I need to take with me. For exemple, how much pocket money will be enough and which kind of clothes I should wear.. I hope to receive your reply soon. I am really looking forward to going  this camp. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Subject: Suggestion about lessons and activities  should be filmed. A - Lessons English It is one of the most popular subject in the school. Also, because this video is their project, it should be filmed. Drama Seeing that this is the first year of the drama lessons, it is not very well known. Also they are showing their first play on the 2nd of July. Part of the show can be filmed. Maths Regarding that the school's maths team won the this year's city's maths competition and is going  to the national school's maths championship, it will be  good idea to film some of their training course and also ordinary maths lesson where the majority of the students attend. B- Social Activities To show the life at the school  is not only lessons and exams, the video should  be inclued the annual summer Fete,  school's weekend trip which is on Friday 7th of July and also the dance which is organized on the last day of the school year.

568," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to answer the questions you asked me in the last letter you sent me. Firstly, I can only travel on July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in  tents a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to practise Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some excersise while I am on vacation. I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have practised them all my life. I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won. Firstly, what kind of clothes  I have to take to the camp, clothes for hot or cold weather?. I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me, too? Those are all my questions. I am looking forward  receiving your reply. Please write  me soon. Yours sincerely Eleonora Jimenez.  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am writing to tell you about my experience at a pop concert last month. As you know, I am a member of a BSB fan club, and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live. Firstly, I helped selling the tickets. That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go. The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes, which it was. What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talk with them about their lifes as  a pop group. I also enjoyed being able to work as  a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB. It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life I am looking forward  hearing from you.

879," Dear Helen Ryan, In response to your letter that I have just received I am writing to give you all the further information you need. According to your letter, I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacations so I would not have to miss any classes. About the accomodation, I would prefer  tents because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities. As I may choose the two activities I would like to practise during my staying at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography. I have been taking singing classes since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it. On the other hand, I am a beginner in photography skills. I would appreciate  if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even  special kind of clothes for those activities. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Yours sincerely CATARINA PONTES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable These days people have been shopping more often than they used to. Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives. First of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment. It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy. On the other hand, sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants. It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something. Furthermore, sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product. In conclusion, like all things in life, shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day. ",34.0
742," Dear Mrs. Ryan, thank you very much for your letter. It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition, which means that I will have the possibility to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me. As request following you will find the information you need . First, I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for  holiday at that period and it would suits me very well. Secondly, I would prefer an accomodation in  tent because I enjyoi being outside close to the nature. Thirdly, what the activities concern, which I can choose, it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them! As I am very good at tennis and swimming I will choose these. I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad. and I am able to swim  every style. Finally, I have two questions. Please let me know which clothes do I need then and how much money in cash and as travellers cheque shall I take with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely E. Elmo.  [SEP]  Sometimes the bad charachters in a story are more interesting than the good ones. I completely agree with this statement. Recently I have red a short story written by Agatha Christie. His title was: ""The Mistery of Hunter's Lodge"". The charachter which I liked most was that of Mrs. Havering, the mistress. It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people: herself and the houskeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it. I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him. She was the head in this story. The plan was almost perfectly and the police hadn't discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot. In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense. Moreover she must have had an ""ice blood"" and strong nerves to handle  in that way. As far as I am concerned I would appreciate to have myself some of her characteristics, like take a decision and handle. ",30.0
890," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to ask for some queries about your letter which I have received. Firstly, I would like to travel  Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp. Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that. Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers, if possible. Thanks for your attention. I really look forward to receiving your reply soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It seems ages since I wrote to you. How have you been? How's your new flat? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat, it really looked nice. Anyway, I'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert. It took place in a Korea national center which was the biggest building in Korea. There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs. I helped to guide foreginers who would like to take participated in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England. That's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well. What I really enjoyed was meeting famous World singers such as Madona, Bon Jovi, Ena and so on. I got Madona's signature! Can you believe it? I'll show you that and some pictures. I really hope to see you soon. Best wishes, ",28.0
1141," Dear Mrs Brown, I am writing in connection with a surprise birthday party for your husband, Mr. Brown. We are writing to invite you and to give you some information about the party. All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him. The party in on Tuesday 16 of June. You should come on 3 pm in  college Canteen. We have bought some snaks to eat and three students will sing for him, also. Besides this, we have invited all  other teachers and the Principal of our school. Of course all the class will take party to this party. Furthermore, we don't know what present buying for him. So we would appreciate  if you  help us with this matter. We have thought  to buy a cd or a book. He loves to read books. What do you believe? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon especially as I am concerned about this matter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays people's life has many problems which need some solutions. Especially younger's life has been very difficult  the last  years. The only appropriate  to solve people's problems is the family. Teenagers usually think about a matter which is drugs. Their family could explain  them how they avoid things. They know the way to do this. And the way is love. Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children with difficulties of school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend. On the other hand, friends are not suitable  to do this. Definately, they don't give real solutions and advice. There is a chance  not to be so good friends and imitate that they are. The way  which  family comes in contact with the members so easily is love. So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions of our problems. ",29.0
682," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I am really pleased hearing from you, I won the prize. So I can go camping for two weeks. It must be great. As regards your questions, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to  U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in the tent. So exciting! And I would like to have chances to play tennis and go swimming. In  case of swimming, I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis before 3 weeks. However, I am very enjoying playing tennis. Further, I have a question. Actually I have never gone camping so I really have no idea about that. I wonder which clothes are suitable for your camping. And How about the money? Do you think if there is some occasions to spend money or not? I am really expecting going camping Yours sincerely JAE KWAI ",12.0
220," Dear manager, Last week I went to the Circle theatre, of which you are responsable, to se the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring ; you have written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had joined the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you have changed the program. Moreover the advertisement said that the show time was 19.30; on the contrary it started with 45 minutes of late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket's price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner. So it was not ""my perfect evening out"" and because of my disappointment I am here to ask you  some money back.  [SEP]  I think modern technology has changed human's life a lot, expecially starting with the last century. The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out: I live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so I cannot go to the city using a bycicle. Because of my ""isolation""  telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and  internet so study or do researches, because there are not  book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like very much play guitar, and in my free time I prefer play electric, than acoustic or classic guitar using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.

Secondly, the show started at 20:15 p.m instead of 19:30 p.m. Thirdly, a theatre restaurant was being closed. But the worst thing is the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove., It was really  let me down!! How dared you could show ""You perfect evening out"" in you advertisement.

544," Dear Sir/Madam! Thank you very much for your letter. I was surprised because I didn't expect that I could win. Now I study and I'll continue my study untill the end of June. Then I'll have  holiday which finish in August. That's why I'd like to travel only in July. I prefer to live in  log cabin because I think it's more comfortable. There are warmer and drier and I'm afraid of insects and spiders. It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest  time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where  in the lake or swimming-pool. I think it's  very usefull and helpful thing for my health especially when I do it with pleasure. The second  my favorit sport is tennis. I've played tennis for ten years I'm a profesional and I have to be good at it, in any time. I want to ask you about money. How much money  I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card. Could you let me know about the weather because I don't know what kind of clothes I should take. Would you send me your answer as fast as it  possible. I look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you Yours faithfully Katerina Petrov  [SEP]  Hi, Kim! How are you? I'm fine soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward for them but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot. Now I want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advices about suits and dresses. Often we looked repetitions and if something didn't like us we tried to correct it. The most enjoable thing was to smart people. We have a good and rich sponsor, that's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style. We always explained  them and at the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loud  audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. You should try it and feel. I'll be waiting for your answer. Best wishes.

687," Dear Competition Organiser: I'm so happy and exciting to receive this letter about  I've won the first prize in your competition. I've been dreaming  to travel to  U.S.A for so many years. The dream happens to me now. So I shall think about it carefully and make everything ready! I would like to travel in July because I have to go back to my country in Auguest. And I'm sure about that the weather in July will be lovely! I prefer living in tents to living in log cabins. I think living in tents is more comfortable for sleeping. Also I am not very keen on sleeping with too many people in the same place. Basket ball is my favourite sporting. It's one of the most popular sports in  U.S.A as well in my opinion. And I was school-team player when I was in High school. So I am good at it. The other thing I would like to do is sailing. But I never try it before. I just think it will be exciting and interesting for me. Maybe I can't manage it! Also I got two questions to ask you. The first one is that shall I take a lot of money or just a little? And the last one is that do I need pillow or blanket or something else? I hope that I will enjoy my journey! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  More and more people like shopping now. You can see so many people walk along the business street every day and any time, especially in Oxford Street. Sometimes shopping can relax people and increase people's working express. But is it always enjoyable? Of course not. The most obvious example is that when you're shopping in the shop you're not sure which one you are going to buy, you turn to the people who sell them, but they sometimes ignore you. So you like them but you don't want them any more. It makes you angry! Also for example. you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tell you ""I'm sorry, this one is sold out""! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately. And sometimes for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you were  rich man it doesn't mater, but if you were  poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable at thoese situation! So I think shopping is not always enjoyable! ",27.0

I went to see it on time as it was written  19:30 but it started t 20:15 with a delay of 45 minutes. This is nothing, it was said that Danny Brook was starring. However a different actor starred and we were all disappointed. What is more, about the tickets, discounts were not available as it was not said so. The last disappointing thing is that the theatre restaurant was closed so we could not visit it after the show. As well as you can understand I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing. Therefore, if avaliable, can you play my money back please?

All of them were schoked by what they heard. As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere. After a week of holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that every of her friends knew  that. She became very shy and engry She couldn't talk with people and she just was very sad. Finally, she couldn't wait and wear to talk to Pat.

1054," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to thank you for the lovely programme you organised for our trip to London, especially because we will have both cultural trips and entertainments, like shopping. I can tell you that we are all looking forward to going there. However, I have been asked by the class to propose  you another visit. We all would like to go and see the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday 14th March, from 10.00 to 19.00, in the London's Central exhibition Hall. This show is about the latest fashions, the leisure and sports wear, the make-up and the hairstyles. Everybody in the class is interested in this show, and it would be a great opportunity for us to see it, especially because many of us would like to work later in the fashion . Moreover, this show won't cost anything because it is free for the students! Consequently, I proposed  to change the programme as follows; on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping, we could go to this show and we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, during our free time. What do you think about that? Hoping to hear from your decision soon. Yours sincerely, (class 3CD)  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time."" Nowadays, most people think that famous people have a so good life ( lots of money, comfortable house ) that they have to stop complaining about he media's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life. On  one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the audiance, and soon. Moreover, especially for film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the Tv or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their fame. However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographs all the time. You can't go outside quietly, and there is all the time a crownd of people who stands in front of your house waiting for you. The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have all the time people around your house who are watching at you or people who are following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this. That is why I think that famous people deserve a private life, like everybody , and that journalists should not follow them everywhere. ",33.00
262," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the show, ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw in your theatre last week. I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected. First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor. However, he was not on the stage that day. Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything. It was a waste of time. I also thought that there should have been discounts for students, which in fact was not available and I had to pay for  normal price. Furthur more, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay. I had to go home without eating a dinner, though I was really hungry. I have to say that the evening was terrible. If I had known all of them, I would have changed my plan and could have a better time. I strongly suggest you should give us  right information. I also would like to claim some refund for the evening. I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion in 100 years If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them. People have become more informal, casual and practical than before. But how about the fashion of the future, for example, 100 years from now? I think it'll also be very different from now. But in which way? First of all, people might think more about the function of clothes than the design. For example, they'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution, sunshine etc. Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouthes and noses like we have sun-glasses, and that all the masks are designers brands, which are made of  special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air. It's like a joke, but a bit scarely. Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from  sun-burn, and it's the most trendy fashion of the year! It's funny. But we never know!! ",32.0

I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement  said the show will start at 19:30 however it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even though, I can't understand  the actor of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove doesn't appeared in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this I wanted to make my evening pleasant however for my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because  some problems of sanitary. I explained to you every detail about what happened in the musical show and I want you refund my money and send to me an apology for what happenned there. I hope hear from you  sooner as possible and thanks for understand my situation. Yours fainthfully Phat Cheung  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Many years ago human beings or whatever we  called was another animal species but when they tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything. Modern technology changed our lifes in many ways, when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste. I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork. Even though, this is not enough  the technology created a better way of communication, first there were letters, after telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through  internet. It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around  just making a click with your mouse and you are there. If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave. When I have a headache I ate pills, made by technology. I think everything round us is thanks for technology but we can't forget that this things was made by us. The human being. Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it. If we creates guns to protect our homes, others will use it to steal our homes,  take advantage from the indefense people. However, the technology never stops, we always search  new things because we are made to compete, discover, think  things which we don't know. ",22.0
1204," Dear Mrs Smith, First of all I'm sorry to hear that Richard Brown is ill. As you are the leader of a group instead of him, I'm delighted to give  all the information you have asked for. The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and from there to the conference, we have organized with the hotel's bus service to take the student to the conference. We will meet at the lobby at 9.00 AM. The conference party will last at 1.00 AM, but every body do not need to stay until the end. There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end. The bus will be service at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM then at the end of the party  will be the last one. Everybody are free to dress for the party but be considering  to be appropriate. On the last day at noon, you could go to the craft centre near by the Airport. There are lots of thing there you will enjoy watching or buying for friends. If there is any information you need to know about the conference, please let me know. I look forward to see you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Telephone saved my friendship It's very hard to decide which invention is the best. Because all of them are so important in difference way. As now I'm being away from home,  telephone is very important to me. Having  telephone I can call my mother, my friends which helping me from  home sick, not completely but I think it's better than other ways. To hear the voice from the person you love is the feelling that  hard to describe, it's wonderful and so real, you can imagine their face clearly. I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e-mail. The problem is the language, we used English but we both were not very good at it by the time which made us misunderstand each other. However, the problem solved by a telephone. We are now still friend. Thanks to the invention of the telephone. ",20.00
467," Saturday, June 17th, 2000. Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" that has been presented in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre in the last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with that. First of all, I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced  to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and the principal point: it started forty five minutes later. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder  you could explain  me why. Due to my huge dissatisfaction, I would like my money back, as you do not make what was advertised. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, MANUELA REVES RAVERNO  [SEP]  The influence of modern technology Every day, the growth of the modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life. Today, almost no one can live without, for example, a television, a radio or electricity in their homes. The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good aspects to my life, like the facility to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image in my cab TV and in my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of comodity can led us, in the future, to a completely ""cold"" world, because of the distance between people that can be caused. Another bad points can be mentioned, like the polution for example. Despite the bad aspects that the modern technology can bring, in my opinion, if the governments tryed to do the best, and if everybody contribute with a little bit, we can solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lifes.

455," Dear Sir, I've been recently to one of yours musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle theatre in London thinking it might be a good idea but it was desappointing. I'm writting this letter to explain  you what had happened and look for a solution. To begin, the organitzation of your collegues of the theatre was awful becouse of diferents problems. Despite saying it will start at 19:30, it done at 20:15 which I think is to much late for a good theatre like yours. After, you say in the advertisement  to visit your restaurant, however it was close, how can you explain that? Secondly, there were some false information in your advertisement that made me angry. You say it would be Danny brook the man who was going to sing but it wasn't. And to sum up, there weren't  discounts on the prices of the tickets. For all of that, I want my money back, at least 15 of the 20 pounds I'd paid. Looking for forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want I knew that it was going to be a concert on owr city  of, from my point of view, the best group of the world, Oasis. And she had planned with my friends went there without me. At first I got angry with Pat more than with the others friends of the group, becouse Pat was and is my best friend. However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked she why. She answered to me becouse all this year I have been so irritated that I got angry with every person who tried to talk to me, and the others friend had convinced her to let me out. The I realised that she got reason, I was irritated becouse my parent was going to  divorce, but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I wasn't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert becouse I had to go to the court to solve my parent's affair. I asked her to look photos of Oasis for me and she accepted. If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry for not being able to go. And that's the history of how I lose the oportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis had done in my city. ",20.0
611," Hello Helen, I have recived your exiting letter, informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I will answer your questions in this letter begining with the best moment for the Camp. Because of my study I will not be free to travel until july and schools goes  on in August again so I hope July will be fine. I much prefer sleeping in tents, it seems more friendly and realy sounds like holydays. Choosing only two activities in such a bunch of interesting ones was quite hard, but I decided to take the two I've never tried, Climbing and Surfing. I would like to know what kind of clothes should I bring and wether I can wash it or not, and I'd like to know how much money will I need for extras? Thank you very much Yours sincerely Andre Michel  [SEP]  Hello Kim, How are you? Excuse me for the long time I left you without any news. I wrote  you last time that I was going to give a hand for the installation and preparation of ""Garbage's"" concert and you asked me to tell you how it has been. So one week befor the concert I went at ""L'Arena"" to meet the other worker and receive the instructions. I've had the hounour  to help their sound engeineer and branch the cables for microphones ggitares etc. We realy started to work like ants the morning befor the show. It was exiting looking  all three mens working together and building a scene, and it was interresting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configuring his computers to get the best sound possible. About two hours befor the beginning of the show, we met the band and recieved tickets to  backstage, that was wonderful, maybe better than the concert itself! And the next morning, I was here again to help them folding their stuffs. That's a great experienc! Now Kim, tell me about your side of the show Yours Andre ",26.0
901," Mrs Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize of the competition of which I need more information. To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to travell. Well, I would be only available in July, because at that time I would be in  winter holidays. Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent than  in a long cabin because it is easier to clean. You mentioned the chance to choose two activities from you list. I would like to do tennis, because I used to play when I was at school and swiming because I like water sports and because I am good at it. Could you also let me know what kind of clothes and how much money I would have to take. Thanking you in anticipation for your help, I look forward to hearin from you. Yours sincerely, KA.

823," 14th June 2000 Dear Miss Ryan, I am really pleased to be the winner of your competition and I cannot help thinking about the two weeks in the USA. First of all, I would like to travel only in June given that my wife will come with me: her holiday are only in June. Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to live in  log cabins? Indeed, my wife is afraid of sleeping in tents. Moreover, I practice Basketball in a famous French Club: That is the reason why I would like to choose the Basketball. If I had to chose an other activity, I think I would do Photography. In fact, this activity seems to be very interresting. Unfortunately, I have never practiced but I feel to like discovering that. Finally, I would want to ask you whether we had to bring  money: Life is so expensive there! Furthermore, what sort of clothes must we have for the different activities? I hope my answers will satisfy you. I thank you again. Yours sincerely Tom Turner  [SEP]  After having thought about this video and asked different people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take  a great part in a day at school; this being in three parts. the morning That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all  students come in  class. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makes the film. Furthermore, as Mathematics are the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film  a time where we are in  MathClass the lunch After that  could come  the lunch which takes two hours per day. The better  to do would be to present the cooking personnal for they are very nice. the afternoon We could begin the afternoon with the sport, showing the different places with  surroundings (near the wild): it would give a good impression. I advise to finish with a lesson of Chemistry so that people see the laboratery. Before that, I would have showed the break at 3 o'clock which is important for us. ",24.0

The conference day our school driver is going to pick you up in the hotel and take you to the conference. The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking. You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual .

Being at Camp California was one of  dreams of my life and now I can relaized it. Firstly, I could to pass this two weeks during next July only, because, before and after it, I have to working as a waiter here in my town. However, about accommodation, I'd prefer a log cabin, becouse it is more confortable than the tent. All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing, because I'm used to playing tennis during every weekends and I'm very keen to surfing. I'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too. Lastly, I'm interested about the law's schools in California, they are very famous here. I would like to know if I will visit at least one of them. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim This is a precise letter that I write  you now. I'm very happy and lazy at the same time. Last month I visited Tom, another old friend, and he told me if I had worked with him like  musician at the XZY pop concert. ""This is extraordinary"", I said. Firstly, I was very embaracing during the concert, but all the staff were very kindly with me and Tom too. This is the most important experience in my life, I knew all the people, in a particular the famous singer ""Kos"". He is funny and easy-going. During the concert, I was near the  and opposite there was ""Pipe"" the biggest  of the world. It's very difficult describing all  emotion I felt. I can only tell  that  had been an important experience for me and for my new songs. Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I obn't be able to write oben this letter yet.

168," Dear Madam and Mister I am writing to you about your theatre: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It played an other one who played very bad. Secondly, the musical should start on 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happend  such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true? And finally, I would  had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I  go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how can it be, it was closed! This are too many negatives points for one evening. I am afraid, but I want my money back. I hope you do not disappoint my in this point. Your faithfully Pica Landen  [SEP]  'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a tabu  by me and my friends. We have discussed about it a lot of times. I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future. I have dout when somebody said, that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change the clothes and the fashion so much again. We have so many kind of clothes and fashion behind our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes moderner so that you can not walk in them anymore. Maybe in 500 years, some people will live on the Mars and then, they  have to wear other kind of clothes. But I don't think this clothes are going to be a fashion on the earth. They just look funny!

At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying. However I will be free in July - but please not that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California. For the accommodation, I would like to stay in tents as I have never slept in one before. It would also be a chance to try it out for the first time in my life. I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never took proper lessons. Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block? Lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet to take? Would there be a bank near the camp? Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, MIDORI FUYU  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter. You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes! Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groups instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as my balloons as we can and sprayed them with gold and silver. The concert went terrific, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having a time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me! At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alread left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night! Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it! Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck! Best wishes, ",37.0
34," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, With regard to your International Arts Festival advertisment, I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and  some suggestions for next year's festival that you might take in consideration. The International Arts Festival is a beautiful idea. I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money. In your advertisment you mentionned that there is artists and stars from all around the world coming, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented. I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the Festival if it is possible. It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kind of music and to discover different culture. Hoping that I did not offend you in any ways and that you might take in consideration my suggestion, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide. The night he came into this world, was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born, it was a casual night. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land. Only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born. When the three men saw him they fell on their knees to worship him. The mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins. This little man from Israel died as the  hero of all times. His message is still as impacting today and will always be even if this story happened a long time ago. ",26.00

Also I am pleased, that I don't have to pay any expenses. I would like to travel  end of July. In June I have other arrangements, such as my school exams and my birthday. It is convenient for me the last two weeks of July. After my school exams I will have time to prepare myself for the trip. In your letter you are asking me to chose which  accomodation I prefer. I would like very much to stay in  tents. Last year I stay in  tents with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it. Summer time the weather is good and I don't see  any problem  anywhere I will stay. During my time in California, I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming. It is my favourite sport. I am good and fast at swimming. Another sport I love is basket ball. Hopefull I will meet some other girls  in the same sport. So we all play as a team. My final question is this. Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks. Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need. Please write soon Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. As a housewife I have a good idea about it. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go two days We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not. I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday  is not the same. Shops are so crowded and it takes  long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we got to face a long queue in order to pay. Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people. I find it very tiring sometimes. Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually much more money we spend than we expect. We can't do anything about is. We have to face it - it has both sides. Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not everyday. ",29.0

First of all, I would like to travel in July because I think California is better in Summer. Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because cabins seem to be more comfortable than tents. According to your letter, I will be able to take part in two activities at the Camp. Let me tell you that I would like to sing and play tennis. As a matter of fact, I am very good at both of them. Finally, I would like you to tell me if I will need some special clothes. If the answer is yes, could you tell me which kind of clothes I will need. One other thing, it would be useful to know if I will need to take with me some extra money. If the answer is yes, could you tell me how much money I will need to take with me.

Yours sincerely, DENIS JIMENEZ  [SEP]  Introduction This report is to suggest which lessons and activities should be filmed in order to make the video about daily life at school. Lessons and Activities suggested Lessons attended in the language laboratory. Special lessons attended in the library. Students using the computer and video room Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings, sing along parties and indoor games. Ordinary lessons attended by students from different levels . By filming... Lessons and activities which take place in the language laboratory, in the library and in the computer and video room, we can also show the school's facilities and how students take advantage of them. Ordinary lessons, it is a good way of showing the relationship between students and teachers. Activities connected with the social programme, we can show how students make the most of their time at school when they are not attending their ordinary lessons or using the facilities. Conclusion I would recommend the lessons and activities mentioned above in order to make the video in question. ",40.0

First of all I came to see a play just becaus my faivourite actrice shoud of been part in it, but she didn't. The evening time on a tiket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 which made visitors stay in a plase for 45 min,  waist of time.

In my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming as well as people  become more niceer, less   will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray. It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable. Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking  clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and Green pease will  very strong community, much stronger and  pouful than it is now. So as we can think the Future Fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people.

94," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I have recently been in London for spending a week's holiday. As I am an enthusiasmic of musicals I went to see this musical show. I am very disappointed because the things that were writen on the advertisment were not really true. It was writen that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there was playing another one. I felt abosolutly disapointed. The musical should have begun at 19:30, but it started at 20:15; it is inacceptable! It was writen too that there were discounts available and I asked for them and they said me that they weren't allow to do any discount. After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks. As you say in your advertisment it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Ms MARIA AROZ  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life. On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day. Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone, if you get lost somebody could find you. I think that the most important  modern technology in these days is  internet. With  internet you can do whatever you want without going out home (shoping, speaking with a friend, working, putting your money aside....) On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies. To sum up modern technology has change a lot our daily life and this is going to increase. ",24.0
1124," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising a good programme for us. All of my classmates are expecting to go to London. I am satisfied with your programme. However I would like to suggest a good idea as a representative of our class. We have just sen the advertisement for 'The London fashion and Leisure Show'. The show include the latest fashions, sports wears and make up. We are very keen on the fashions and make up. Moreover, the admittion fee is free for students. It would be a great opportunity to study the latest fashion trend. It is held at the 'Central Exhibition Hall' on 14 March., from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Therefore we could go there after the Science Museum. If some students want a  shopping, they could go on 15 March. Because we have a free time on 15 March  afternoon. I hope you will consider my suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'A robot wakes me up at 7 A.M. every morning. I am served breakfast with fresh coffee. Washing and cleaning have been already done by my robot maid! Everybody might dream about this kind of situation. It would be come true in the near future. Our robot maid will do all of  house work instead of  human. In addition to this you will be able to control all part of  house by a computer such as temperature or vacume cleaning. However, this robot can not replace of mother or wife. They can clean the house but they can not give the affection to the family. Children need parents love and support all the time. To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives would be more convenience. But these robots can not be replaced of  warm-heart human. ",25.00
1135," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the good programme which you have organised. There is only one thing we don't agree with you , it is the  Tuesday 14 March. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. and we would all like to go to this show. It would be very special for us because we haven't seen something like that before. There are four different shows. First there is a show with  latest fashions, after they show us the leisure and sports wear and then there are the make up and the hairstyles shows. The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of the show is free for students. You see, the programme has only to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping  how you have organised in your programme. In our opinion; it is enough to go one time in a museum and it is on Wednesday . Thank you in advance for your trouble Yours sincerely your English Class 4A  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Now, we are in the 21th century. Most of us live in houses or flats and it is most very comfortable. But in which kind of homes will people stay in the future? What will be different and what wont change? We can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer. I have further ideas: In the futur, maybe in 2113, there will are houses like now but only with more technical things. The life at home will be more easy because  a refrigerator which fill up itself or a bathroom which clean itself. So, people wont have to clean their houses because there are  machine for all  works. But I think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair. These things and a lot more went change or wont be forgotten. So, I think. houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present. This is my idea and we will see! ",26.00
998," Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you very much. I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel only in July, because in June I have to study at school which hasn't finished until the end of June. In August, I have already made another appointment with my friends. We are going to visit the places of interest of China, as usual, our new term begins in September. I only can travel in July Accommodation I would prefer in tents to in log cabins. Tents are very easy to take and  go everywhere. What's more, in my opinion it is very romantic. I am good at singing and photography. I can sing most kinds of songs, such as pop music, folk. I like taking photograph, in my only room. There are all kinds of photos, for example,  beach, sea trees and so on. In the end, I wonder what kind of clothes I should take and how much money I should bring with me. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  To: Mrs Flame From: Kate Subject: which lessons and other activities should be filmed Instruction: The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and lessons  be filmed into a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class. Results: The majority of them said it's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills. Sixty percent recommended that the activity which called make the brain up in the morning class should be filmed. Ten of them said  should make the computing. Two thirds said we should film a part of playing football. Reasons: Although Maths is very boring, it is very important in nowadays. English is the most popular language in the world, what's more, more and more people start to learn English. The activity of making brain up can help us remember new words. Playing football is good for  health. Conclusion: It is recommended that  should be filmed about Maths, English study skills,make brain up and a part of playing football. ",26.0
274," Dear Sir or Madam, I am a foreign woman who had a week's holiday in London and decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show. That show wasn't as it  supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writting to you. One of the problems is that a couple of actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, were the ones supposed to act and a different actor took Danny's place, it was disappointing! The second show was supposed to start at 19:30, but to make the matters worse, it started at 20.15, so after the show I couldn't got to the cinema. Apart from that I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for  holidays. On top of everything the tickets didn't offer any discounts, so  the last day I couldn't buy the present for my neighbour. I am writting to ask  a refund of the £55 which I spent on the ticket for the miserable show. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully. Jane Smythe  [SEP]  I am going to write about how has modern technology changed our daily life. First of all I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions of human  and that without it we couldn't be where we are wright now. One of the best examples is the car: in a lot of cities around the world, cars can be seen in the streets all day long. During the last decade the number of people who has a particular car has increased very fast. On the other hand people who hasn't any cars, can also be helped by technology: they can use the public transport like the train or the bus, which is also a comfortable form of travelling. But if you want a fastest  transport, the plane is the perfect one! But technology can also help you at home if you use modern machines for cleaning your house, clothes or dishes. Apart from that, technology also helps in hospitals. Every  time  more machines help doctors and nurses with their difficult tascs. In contrast, technology is very bad for the nature: if we use cars we contaminate , and many cars are being used every day! On balance I think that evidently technology has got more advantages than disadvantages. ",24.0
647," Dear Ryan I am writing to reply for your letter about  competition. First of all I would like to say that I am very happy that I won first prize in your competition. Secondly you asked me, when I have time for travel, so I can go only in July, because only in July I have holiday. And I would like to go in the first part of this month,  socond part I spend with my familly. If you do not mind I would prefer  tent, because in  tent I will be along. While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing, because it is my favorite sport. I am good at it - I am sailing from childhood. The second activities which I would like to do is surfing - I have never do it. I would like to know, how much money I must have with me? And what clothes I should take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faitfully Aniela Chmielewski  [SEP]  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" 'This is such a marvellous book you will want to read it again' In my opininion this book 'The Old Man and the sea' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway had writen. Thise book is about  men who know that he will die soon, he know that he didn't made his dream coom tru. So he decidet to go for  last trip in his life. Hes destenation is get  Marlin. He is very old, and he isn't so strong that he should be. He need to rest, but he don't geve up. I the end he make his drems coom tru, he get  vast Marlin. In thise book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it can be deficult and take  long time but we can do it. We must believe in our selfs. People in our ages should think about this. Sometimes they geve up, befor they get something,  To sum up I must say that every-one should read this book. ",23.0
1178," Dear Mrs Smith, I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best. I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference. As far as  organisation is concerned,  adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station. To come to our college, you can either watch downhill to the lake front (about 10 min) or take the new cable car from the train station. The college is just stairs away from the bottom end. The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. Appart of that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear. Depending on the interests of your students, I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office: www.neuchatel.ch. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Where are you? is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone. Why? Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever. The mobile phone. Once heavy, expensive and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers. Due to the mobile phone. communication has changed, not improved. Of course it allows  to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy. Mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes, we should right on it CAUTION: use of this device may damage your brain. ",30.00

Especially  River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forwold to his. By the way, on  14th of March  LONDON Fashion Show and Leisure show will hold at  Central Exhibition Hall. We are very interested in this. We have a great opportunity to learn   latest fashion free because of  students. Therefore if you could change the program on 14th, we would be very happy. Could you consider this for us? We're looking forwold to your reply. Thank you. Faithfully, your students.  [SEP]  The Home of the Future. As  developing modern society, we will become to have more material than now. Invent glass was very eventuly to architect. Architecuture with use of grass brough us the modenism in 1980. In the future we can expect having  new material and it will make our living more confortable and convinient. In Japan, crime of minority is increasing. It said that as one of the reasons  small separete room makes kids unsociable and dissapointed. Therefore Japanese architect consider designing of use many glasses as much as they can in house and try not to create speparate dark room. Otherwise as producing new electoronic, our home of  future will be more convinient. On the other hand  inside of the house will be too simple. Although  high might be still  same. Because human high won't change so much, unless 10000 years passed. ",17.00
49," Dear Ms clark: I am writing to give suggestion for the international art festival, which I have been to one weeks before. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year. Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it is very interesting, especially for the young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time  very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world  on the advertisement, but in fact they are from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls are too small, could you consider making them bigger next year. The plays and films were really wonderful, people liked them very much, so could you play more next year The last thing is about the ticket. It was excellent about one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will be also like this. I hope that you can consider my suggestions. I really look forward to going to the festival next year. Yours sincerely:  [SEP]  Dear Jacob: I'm very glad to hear from you. I hope everything is ok. I'm really sorry I didn't write you back immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you. In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet during the lessons, we should go there in the brake. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt, I don't like it. If I can, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success at once, we should give them  second chance to try. Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home,  just don't take trouble to my family, that's all. OK, just here. I look forward to hearing from you soon. All the best wishes and good luck. yours: ",28.00
244," Dear manager of the Circle Theatre, Last night, I cam to your musical show, ""Over the rainbow"" and I was very disappointed because it wasn't  what you writed in your advertisement. For example, your advertisement said that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not them! They were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This event was not the only one because another problem was the respect of the time. Your advertisement said that the show will start at 19:30 PM, but it has started at 20:15 PM. I don't like to have such big change in time. The third problem was that it was writting that the discounts were available, but when I get there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation. After that, I can tell you that I spend the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied about ""You will have a perfect evening!"" After all these explanations, I am sure that you will understand that I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night. So I wish to hear soon about you. Yours sincerly Leia Beroni  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology, such as computer, car and other else, changed my life in many different ways like communication, traveling and working. For example, a car, which is used from everyone everyday, changed my daily life in the sens that I don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology, but because I can show that I am responsable. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries that Switzerland. Another  technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it like homeworks, works, photos, but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web. This  a big walk in the technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. At last  technology that I would like to bring out is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or  else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one  here  are the most important in the change of my daily life .

223," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, On 14th June 2000 I went to see your ""Over The Rainbow"" musical show and I have a few points which I would like to bring to your attention. Your advertisement was featuring ""Danny Brook and Tina Truelove"" as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening. The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30 however the show started at 20:15. As I came to London on holidays and purchased ""The London City Guide"" I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance. Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were  quotas  available at that price but were already sold out! After the show we tried to go to your restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for renovation! I was very disappointed of my supposed ""perfect evening out"" to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY ""Technology"" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me. From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings to develop positively and negatively. Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc. were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today. Back in the 30's the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies. The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people.  The fast and growing computer industry is giving us less and less physical work due to a mechanical concept. Biotechnology is providing us with the latested discoveries to heal or improve the human body to  its most efficient state. Transport means are also part of the overall technology and allow us to go faster, further than before with less effort. Besides all those improvements and confort I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands. ",36.0
521," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your music show entitled ""Over the Rainbow"" Which I saw during my holiday in London. Firstly, I expected to see the play by Danny Brook who is my favourite actor. However, without any announcement, a different actor was playing his role. Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show would have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed because of the equipment mentenance. You should have let us know such information in advance. Finally, although I heard the student discount ticket was available, the ticket salesman said I should have bought it at least one day before the show. I was not satisfied with your show at all. Therefore, I think you should pay some money back for me. Please let me know how you think of my complain and request as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Thank you for modern technology. I think modern technology has changed my daily life, especially in communication with my best friend who is studying in Britain. We had seen each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain. I used to think I would miss her. But now I can communicate with her every day by e-mail. Furthermore, we can talk on the phone. I feel no distance as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan. Without a computer and a telephone, I couldn't contact her easily and I may lose touch with her. in addittion, I could go tot Britain to see her by plane. Before the plane was invested, I suppose it might take several months to visit Britain by ship. In present, it takes just 12 hours by plane. Thanks to such modern technology, I can improve the relationship with my friend, even if she is living  away from me. ",27.0
1069," Dear Mr. Robertson: I'm writing  you representing all the english class in order to let you know how exciting we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interresting on doing in London while we're there. First of all, we'd like to thank you for the programme you all ready arrange it's wonderful, because it covers most of our interrests. But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure show that will be held at the Central kExhibition hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00. So we suggest to put it this way on Tuesday 14, in the morning go to the Science Museum and instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion show, because  will be the latest fashion, leisure  and sports wear, make up, and hair styles, and as you know us, we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are  London. Thank you for your time, and We're looking forward to hearing from your opion. faithfully yours  [SEP]  IT WAS DANGEROUS, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT ...BECAUSE Since always I'd gotten the idea of travel abroad and experiece others people's life and cultures, so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university. I arrived in Paris for New Years Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a little amount of money. But eventhough all of these desadventages above, I was folling my dreams and objectives and inspite of everything I was going to do it. So suddenly, a week later I found me a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke french at that moment. It took me three months to overcame the languages and after this time the whole familly falled in love with me,  that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the familly, eventhough It was very hard at the beggining.

1045," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I would like to say thank you to you Mr Robertson for planning to take us to spend three days in London. Your programme looks very interesting, especially the River Trip to Greenwich, which I always dreamt of. However, we have seen an advertisement on the English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00. The show will have  latest fashions from  top fashion designers in the world. Leisure show will have leisure and sports wear, new make up style and new hair style for next year. The best thing is that it is free because we are students. We would like to ask you whether we can change some  programme. Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show. We won't miss any programme that you have planned and we could also have  great opportunity to see the show. We're looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time"". In my opinion, everybody wants to have a happy life in our own world, we want to do whatever we want, sometimes we do the right things and sometimes we do the wrong things. We are ordinary people, we work and come home to have activities with our family or go out together. The politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. Although, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of  public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their story always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story base on the true story just to get  attraction from people. I think, if the journalist want to publish the politicians and film stars private life, they should have asked for permission. They deserve to have a private life as everybody .  ",28.00

At the assembly students are told about changes in the timetable and activities for the whole day. In the computing department student learn about informational technologies. The main job of the head of the computing department is not to teach but to keep the computers working properly. Maths is the most popular subject in the school. Mathematics teachers do  great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons. In the chemistry lab experiments are often set up. The teacher looks after the pupil while they are investigating the topic of the lesson. Meals are very important. Kitchen staff works hard to provide students with  variety of food. The video can be finished with a view of the school from outside. ",35.0

Firstly, I have had no discount at paying. secondly there was  delay which got me into trouble, After the show I couldn't catch my train.

As a result of this our society has changed a lot. On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier. On the other hand we have faced some problems, such as social and environmental problems. Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before. Although in those days the only way of learning was reading. These days we can use  computer, television and some sophisticated equipment. which were unusuall before. Than to technology we can reach any place in the world easily. We can get some information more quickly. Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well. Children play wit computer instead of  usuall plays. Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively. There has been  change  relatinships between people. People are getting more and more lonely. We have noticed the environmential damage in recent years. While we are using technology, we should take into consideration  environment. We shouldn't allow to be exploited the world. If we want to leave a good world to the next generations, we should behave more respectfully againgst the nature. ",27.0

Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage. As you known, I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that  why I chose to paint the scence of the background. I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice. And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of ""Bon Jovi"" on every T-shirts which are given to the audiences. I felt that it was a great time in my life. However, I told my teacher that I am willing to give a hand next time. Are you willing to give a hand next time? If you are, I'll tell you  in advance. I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do. Best wishes ",33.0
956,"  Mrs Ryan When I received your letter, I was very surprised and happy because I don't remember that I did this competition. First I can travel only in July because, I will finish school at the end of June and I will pass my exam in Septemeber; so I have to repeat  it a lot during the month of August. To answer your second question, I choose the accomodation in  tents because I like to sleep outside. For the activities, I choose the Golf and the Surfing (that wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, cause almost  choice interested me) I tried the golf twice, I'm really bad but I hope to do much progress . I never did surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic. I have just two questions. Can I wash any clothes there? How many money will I have to take with me? Please phone me to answer my two questions. Thanks for all Mar  [SEP]  Hello Kim I'm sorry I can only write now because last week I have too much work. As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert of last month. With my friend Miko we looked for a little job during a week-end and one evening we met a guy who wanted to buy some drinks in the pop concert and so we told him that we were agree to help him at the bar. It was a wonderful week-end: we were opposite to the singers and we have seen every concert without buying any tickets entry! (we were include in the staff of the concert) At the end we have 1200. - of benefice and each  us take 400. - for himself I particulary like seeing all this people, and I meet a lot of new friend there. For next year we search for a new barwoman. Write to me soon and tell me if you want to join us for 2001. Love Mar ",22.0
169," Mr Manager, I'm sorry of writing  you for such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you announced: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased  to see Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the scene! By the way, what really upset me was the time of starting. According to your advertisement it was at 19:30, and, what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost which was from £10 to £20, but despite my thoughts I had to pay £20 without   chance. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me. As you can see it's not a perfect evening, isn't it? I'm asking you  my money back, you can do it, can't you? Wondering your comprension your sincerely  [SEP]  THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA - Ernest Hemingway As I see it, the Old Man and the Sea is a really exiting book. It describes a challenge, the challenge of life. The major characther is the old man who has to fight against the sea to keep alive. It could be his last adventure. This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish  something good. By surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen, a beautiful marlin. The man keeps immediatly in contact with it. They are going to be one thing linked together. They're fighting for the same reason with the same strenght, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish. I think they're really brothers, they feel the same pain and fear during the battle. If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man's  same thing. When the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased. He respected and still loves it. But, afterwards, the life's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that's the most difficulty  to face  to. ",24.0
1168," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give some information on the conference as you required. First of all, your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is very convenient to stay  and has  beautiful landscape. I would recommend you get to the conference by subway, because  subway station is situated in 5 minutes' walk from the hotel. It will take you about 15 minutes to arrive at the college. There will be a party after the conference. We will serve you dinner and some college students are going to sing, play musical instruments and so on, but you can join  if you wish. Therefore, you had better wear casual and comfortable clothes. Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on. You will be able to buy them in   reasonable price. I hope you will enjoy your stay in my country. I look forward to meeting all of you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Amusement Centre Introduction The aim of this report is to give information on the Amusement Centre in Seoul. It is based on my experience and on views expressed by local people who were interviewed. Facilities It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself.

705," Dear Ms Ryan Thank you for your letter. I was so happy to hear that I have won a two weeks holiday in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July. I am going to finish my exams in June, and I am planning to go back to China in early August. So if I could travel in July, and coming back before  6th of August, that would be great. I would prefer living in tents to log cabins. I have never had any experience  to live in a tent, so I would like to give it a go. I think I will enjoy myself in a tent. I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really wanted to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach  could give us a lesson during the Camp. Also, I would like to join  basketball team, I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during  last ten years in our city. I am glad I had taken a part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team. Would you tell me that how much money you would give it to me and how is the weather like in  U.S.A. Thank you for every thing! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine in your place. You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping  last month? I must say that was a great fun, I've never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets, they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had  chance to see most of the performance, that was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During  break time I did give a lots of direction to people who can't find  toilet, and  information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was  bit boring, but it was part of my job. I got to go. Write to you next time. Love ",34.0
1038," Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you very much for your programme but we have another plan  to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which unluckily  on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum so we would like you to change the plan a little. Your programme is very good, especially that we can go to visit the Science Museum which I heard is very good but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles and it is free for students too. So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and to do the shopping after the show. Thank you very much and we look forward to hearing from you. With great respect,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I climed up the tree. My friend was looking at me from below. I went on climbing until I saw my friend's model aeroplane. If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been here. No, it wasn't the time to regret , just get it and it would be all over. I stressed my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg. It was very hurt, my friend rushed to me than ran back to my house and called Mom. I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster. The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out. Mom came in, looking very angry, I prayed for a short conversation. ",28.00
190," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - over the rainbow. I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which is published on the newspaper. According to the advert, it says clearly that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, for whom I was coming. After the show we went to the Theatre restaurant, but it was closed due to the refurbishment. I am not really satisfied about the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out. I therefore would like to have a compensation of  £30 which I spent on the tickets. Your Sincerely   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread out the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it. I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful. but this idea was soon be put off since I noticed on the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck, I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. The last few days, we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'. ",29.0
619,"  Dear Ms Helen Ryan I am writing this letter as an answer to your request for some further information from me. I would like to travel in July, because I have recently got a new job, which I am going to start in August. Therefore, July is my last free month until much later. I would prefer to stay in a tent during the camp, as I find tents a lot more exciting than log cabins. I am a very good swimmer, so I choose swimming from the activities you listed. I am also very keen on climbing, although I am not extremely good at it. I would also like to ask how much money I am supposed to take with me and I would be glad if you could give me an answer before the camp begins. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Bibiana Krol  [SEP]  Most people enjoy shopping. But not me. I think shopping is hard, exhausting work, especially when you are trying to buy yourself some new clothes. The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular stuff for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you. Eventually, after long seeking you find a skirt you like. But it doesn't fit. You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one. And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams. And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop. Accident like that can really make you livid. At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town. You phone your friend to visit you and your friend come, wearing the skirt not unlike the one you have just bought. But that's the life. You can always go and buy a new one. ",34.0
144," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the unexpected evening I had when I went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" in your theatre. First of all, the time for the second session was meant to be at 19.30, but somehow it began at 20.15, which was a 45 minutes delay. I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing of that evening. But my complain does not finish here. It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts. And what is more, I could not go to the restaurant after the show, as it was closed because the main chef was ill and could not come to work. Definetely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back. Looking forward to hearing from you, Alessandra Lane.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As soon as she arrived home, she phoned her best friend Sue and told her everything, all details included. She also told her not to tell anybody about it because it was a secret. The thing was that Mary couldn't resist the secrecy and phoned her cousin, who also studied in our school. She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary didn't tell her it was a secret, so on monday at 9 a.m. MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day, eventually everybody had read the ""news"". I didn't know it was published as I didn't read the paper and no one told me anything, either. But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to eachother. At first I didn't realise what was happening, but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed eachother in the park last friday. Suddenly my face went all red and I ran towards the toilet. I had never felt so embarrassed and miserable in my life, but luckily next day almost everybody forgot about it. That day I swore to myself that I would never trust anybody again. ",39.0
1093," Dear, Mr Robertson. I am writing to ask  some information about the programme which our class would like to join. There are a few questions which I have wondered. First of all, Would you give me an explaination about the London fashion and Leisure show? We regard that the show might be  great opportunity for the most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure. In addition, I would like to get your suggestion  how  programme could be changed on the second-day of the trip. so that we could enjoy going to both  science Museum and the London fashion and leisure show. I am appreciated  you for offering a well-organised programme, especially, the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in. I am looking forward to getting your reply. your sincerely.  [SEP]  In the middle age, Nobody expected to have a electric goods which have been helping to do housework.

As the result, we can observe that the home of the present have a lot of machines which make home like a factory. By contrast, In the future, I guess we would rather go back to the acient time, owing to have natural life style. We will be unwilling to give a housework away. Being at home with doing housework, taking care of their children, might be  purpose of the future life. ",18.00
284," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"", which was played in the ""Circle Theatre"", because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all I would like to say something about the starring: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard about. So the main point of my visit had dissappeared. Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later. A serious theatre can't miss  such an important thing, the starting-time. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was going to pay for the tickets, I found another thing : there were no discounts avaible. In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence. But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed, without  saying the reason. I had to go back to the hotel, because all  restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded. Summing up, you might have noticed that that wasn't ""my perfect evening out"" wich you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back. This might be the only way I keep on relying on your theatre. I hope I will receive an answer. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and because of this Pat caused a big, but stupid problem. It was late in the night, and Pat was thinking about something Nick had told her that afternoon: - ""Don't tell Marie I was here"". Nick was Marie's boyfriend, and Marie  a very good friend of hers. They were in the shopping centre, and the problem was that Nick wasn't alone, he was with a very beautiful girl. What could Pat do? That morning Marie had told her that Nick couldn't go to the cinema with her because he had a lot of work to do in the afternoon so.. what was he doing there with that girl? In the end Pat phoned Marie and told her: she was a very good friend. Marie was so shocked that, as soon as Pat had stopped speaking, she phoned Nick and, without letting him say anything, she broke up their relation. But the truth was very different, because what Nick was doing there was something which had nothing to be with what Pat had thought. Nick was there because the following Sunday would be a very special day for him: he would have been going out with Marie for three years, and he wanted to buy a present for her. But..what about the girl? She was his cousin! She works as a model, and she was advicing him about which clothes, etc,... buy for her. Pat couldn't keep that secret, and in spite of helping Marie, she made a couple disappear. ",30.0
1078," Dear Mr. Robertson, My name is Bao-yu Liao. I am  representative of our class in your college to write to you. We are very grateful for what you have well-organised the programme going to London for us. It is a good programme, especially  National Art Gallery is one of the most places we would like to visit. This is because we are very interested in art. In fact, some of our classmates have seen an advertisement for the 'London Fashion and Leisure Show'. Concidently the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14 which is during the period we are in London for the three-day programme. We think it is a great opportunity because we are very interested in art and fashion. Of course,  leisure as well. Therefore, if it is possible, we would like to see the show in the afternoon on 14 March instead of going shopping. It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange  the programme to be changed. We look forward to hearing a good news from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. We know it does not matter  they are famous or not, everyone has his own privacy. However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious. We like to know and chat about gossip. This is why gossip magazines are so popular. Due to commercial value, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep  their private lives to satisfy us. There, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them. However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and priciples are also being concerned. Of course, it everyone pays less attention or interest, the situations should be better. I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana died in the car crash was one of the most disarster examples. Although we can not deny it is our nature -  curious, we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them. Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and  Royal family have more privacy. Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives. ",31.00
58," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to express my enjoyment that I had at the International Arts Festival the next week. Firstly, I want to say that this festival is really good and I hope it will have every year. Furthermore, the attractions were beautiful such as shows, exhibitions and concerts. I liked all the different kind of atmosphere. Also, for all these attractions, the price was low and it is important for the big family. Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous. However, I was disappointed by the number of that. It will be great if there were would have more choice the next year. I would like to give you a suggestion about the space in the concert rooms. Considering the crowded, it should have more rooms. Finally, I will be interested in meet artists from everywhere in the world not only Europeen artists. In conclusion, I had an unforgetable time. I would like to eat some different kind of foods, if it is possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

In fact, at school we haven't so many rules. So, we aren't allowed to smoke inside - and eat in the classroom. We have to wash the board when it's our turn. Of course, we must respect the teacher and do what he says. What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, then I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask at my Mum or Dad for going  by my friend after the lessons. They wanted that I did my homework before  to play. Also, I had to come back at home on time, it was very important for my parents. I want to change nothing, I was happy. Anyway, it was a great time when I was a child. It's all for now.

267," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000. Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I'd not go there because everythings went wrong. I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for student like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day it delaied about 45 minutes. During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove. There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them. It really disappointed me. After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed. It was a sign in front of the restaurant ""sorry we  closed because special reasons"" and I was wondering what was the reasons for that. Finally I would like to have  refund for my ticket back because it was  horrible evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Paya Chuaswee (Miss)  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets that  why our great plan for  horiday were not be real.

We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place by 6 o'clock in the evening. The sun was shining and  wind were breezing like we had imaged. Whlile I was standing on the beach suddenly I heard someone called my name and said that I had to go home, that  right, she is my mum. She told me Pat had phoned her while we were going and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to went by bicycle. Eventhrough we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never though about it. From now on I don't want to tell something secrets to Pat because she always tell someone else but she  still my best friend. ",26.0
846," 13rd of June Dear Helen Ryan, I was really happy when your letter arrived and I node that I won the first prize in your competition. I have never been in the U.S.A. Now I will give you the informations which you asked for. For me it is only possible to travel in July. That is the only month where I have time because after July I have to start with the University. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I am used to it. When I was a child my parents and I spent a lot of time at camps. You wrote that I should choose two activities. I have chosen golf because I playing golf sine 1998 and I want to improve it and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start with climbing. I could play in the first week golf and in the second I could start with climbing. What about money and clothes? You know what kind of clothes I need and could you give some advices  how much money I will need? Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it. Honestly I had never a shopping tour which I didn't enjoy when I was alone. I can remember one shopping tour which I had  with a man and it was  nightmare. It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows and it is not easy to buy shoes you have to choose carefully. I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything. We left the shop without  shoes, in  horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour which was not enjoyable. To sum up, my advise is that the women should go alone or with a female friend. ",26.0
254," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow  musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night. Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even  it was stated in your advertisement , but the main role was played by an unknown actor. Secondly, I had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up. Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount, even that your advertisement promised them. To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs. As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one during my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to pay the address above. Yours faithfully, Katja Menan.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Almost everyone is trying to be fashionable and look modern. Every season we can see  arrival of new styles, fabrics and proportions. Let's try to imagine, what will clothes be like 100 years from now? I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be  mixture of styles from different times of the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. A new technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colour during the day. In the future people will be even more concerned with pollutions and harmful UV-rays. So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy. With so many choices shopping for clothes is going to be even greater fun than it is now. Fashion of the future will not be the same as today's, but it will be more exciting and fun! ",33.0
155," Dear Manager, Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"" and I was really disillusioned. In the advertisement, it was told that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really dissapointing. I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance at him. Also, in the schedule, the time of the show was written as 19:30, but it started at 20;15 and, I missed the dinner I was going to have with my best friend in London. Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill gates, I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets; but I had to give the exact price of the ticket, which I consider  as a fault of your theatre. In addition to these, it was mentioned that your restaurant was open after the show, but it was not because there was no food to be served. As you can understand, it was a dreadful time and I went my money back as a solace for the dissapointment I had. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  TECHNOLOGY AND MY DAILY LIFE In my daily life, I use the facilities of modern technology very often and it really makes my life easier to live. However, I go far away from my family and other people and have virtual relationships. Until 1996, I used to go to school on foot or by public bus; but since 1996; I take the underground to go to school. It is much quicker, and I do not have to wake up very early in order not to be late. Also, I use my computer and  Internet very much in order to reach some information, do my projects and communicate with my friends. To talk to a friend from another city or country instantly online is really nice and exciting. I do not have to wait for a letter for days and I gain so much time again. on the other hand, because of dealing with computers so much, I can not see my family and friends very much, even when we are at the same medium. It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker. But despite this, I am very happy with the facilities of technology in my daily life. ",36.0
42," Dear Ms. , I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed  the exhibitions of the festival that you had organized. Furthermore, it's  worthful experience for people  to know  the other countries' arts. But I would like to suggest some requests for the festival. Firstly, it is better to invite more artists not only from six countries. For example, the artists or stars from we have rare chance to feel the atmosphere. Secondly, some concert halls were too small to enter all of the audience. Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people had gathered one time. I would prefer to be held more performances next year in the bigger halls. Finally, regards to tickets, it is  very wonderful idea because it is more combinient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people. You may consider my suggestion to have the art festival for next year. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Long long time ago, there were the old man and old woman  lived in a foot of  mountain. One day, when the old man went into the bambo bush, he found one bambo gritted white. He had never seen such bambo before but decided to cut it down. Then there was a lovely baby in it. He was surprised but was pleased because he had no child. He took the baby to his house and explained what had happened in the bush to the old woman. The old woman was glad to have a baby and they decided to bring up the baby. The baby was named 'Kaguya.' She grew very quick and was so beautiful. A lot of men asked her to marry with them but she always refused. One full moon night she said to her parents sadly, 'I have to return to the Moon tonight.' The old man and woman tried to keep her staying  their house, but they couldn't. The servants from the Moon picked her up to the Moon. She gone away. She was the princess of the Moon. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
214," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"". I was very disappointed because the actors wasn't Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Instead of them you had different actors. Then the show delayed, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30. I had to wait 45 minutes! Another point is that the discounts wasn't available although I could red  it before at your notice. After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but as I arrived in the restaurant it had been closed. But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the resaurant after the show. I can't understand such kind of mistakes. You wrote also that the evening would be perfect. For me it wasn't and because of that I ask you to give me my money back. If you can't give me all the money back then do it particularly. I  give you my phone number, you can reach me from 8 o'clock till 12 o'clock: 08532143251 Please call me back soon. Yours faithfully Carolina Schwitt  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all I do is becoming more comfortable. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search  something like a telefonnumber or an adress I also look it up from the internet. I use also the internet when I need any informations for example  I need them for school or private for myself. A few years ago I had to go in a library and look it up in many books. Most that took a long time. I think the advantage of modern technology is that all I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbys or for friends. Another important point for me is that things like listening  music or watching TV sounds better and the pictures on TV are being impoved, because the machines become more better. And also a good intention for me is the Handy, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people. ",24.0
257," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre  the 5th of June. I have been very disappointed by the quality of the show and the lies in your advertisement. Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without  information or excuse  from the direction. Secondly, I coudn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill. I am therefore asking for a complete refund of my ticket and I hope you will improve the quality of your services in the future. Yours faithfully H. Coulez  [SEP]  Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The poor boy was only 5 year old and at this age, it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret. So when he heard at random that my parents were planning to offer me a trip to San Fansisco as  present for my birthday, my little brother ran in my bedroom wherever I was studying and whispered in my ear the wonderful news. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a place on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for already one month.

1092," Dear Mr Robertson My name is Gabriel and I represented our class. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would particularly like to go to the show. As representant of my class may I kindly ask you to change partially your plan during our visit in London. The Monday 13 March would be fine. The morning  visiting interesting places in the City and on the afternoon  make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent. Because the London Fashion programme takes place on Tuesday, I would suggest to change your plan. There is a very interesting programme for young people like we. There will shown the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear,  several additional attractions. It will be beutiful if you would agree to change your plan. The last day, the Wednesday 15 March will surely  very interesting because the National Art Gallery is  very famous place in London. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it., It happened on a very lovly day in summer. The sun was shining, the Chanel was clear blue and I was walking by the Sea. Suddenly I heart somebody crying for the help. Not studying for too much I ran as fast as I could direct  there I heart the voice . I knew, I can't swimm then I realized it might be dangerous for me as well. But in this particular moment it wasn't important for me. The most important things was a little boy  about ten years old, who was in the watter without  parents and couldn't swimm. It was diffucult for me because I am afraid of watter. Although I went quickly to him and took him on my hands. He was exhaused and couldn't breath. In the meantime a man told me he were a doctor and could help the boy. I was very happy that I managed to save the live of the boy. Now, when I consider about the events it's clear for me that if I got  a few minutes later  probably would be to late. You should ignore the dangerous if you  convince you can save somebody his live. ",26.00

It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautifull country. Now my dream will come true. I will try to give you some information about me. The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then I can have holidays. I would be pleased if it is possible. About accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in the tent and I would like to try it. It will be very interesting for me because normaly I have not a lot of time to do activities. I would prefer swimming because I very like it and I am trying to swim anywhen I have got some time, and painting because I have finished  painting course and I have some practice with this. That is very nice that every costs are paited for but I would like to ask you how much money I should to take with me because I do not now anything about prizes in the U.S.A. and please to tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activite.

It was  realy wonderfull new experience for me. I have never before met so many people and I didn't now that is so hard to keep everything in order during the concert. Now I now that everything need patient, time and hard work before someone will sing any record on scene. The people were wonderfull, they was helping each other with everything and it was a lot of easier to do. It is  very nice feeling when you need help and  is so many people which want to help you. I will never forget this concert and those people. It was good experience which I will never forget. I hope I will be able to do it again. ",24.0
753," Dear Helen Ryan, I am amazed with the prize in your competition. I am looking forward to go to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information. I would like to travel only in July because this is the only month that I am on holiday each year. About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in  tents because it will be a new experience for me. I like to get new experiences specially when I am on holiday. I am pleasant to have the opportunity to practice sports as well. I am good at swimming and playing tennis. I would like to know how much money I need to have to spend there and if I need to take with me my sports clothes. Will the Camp California provide the clothes for swimming and play tennis? If you need some more information let me know. Yours sincerely Rita Fernandez.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping is a very good practice that's give you more opportunity to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping at least they say that . Despite the fact that it love shopping I have to agree that it is not ""always"" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's boring. You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas. Another point is  now you don't need to go out just for shopping. You can buy a lot of products by  Internet. I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it. In conclusion I think there is boring time and enjoyable time when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring time. ",28.0
966," 13th June 2000 Dear Edouard, Firstly, let me thank you for your nice letter of June 10th. I was so surprised but so glad to read that I won the first prize in your competition. In response to your question and if you don't mind, I would prefer to travel in July because I've already chosen my holiday and my boss won't give me another one. I would be grateful if I could accommodate in a log cabin. I'm no more a young girl! and do appreciate a little bit of comfort. As you asked me, my favourite activities would be painting and climbing. I like very much the moutains and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk. Would you be so kind as to write  me as soon as possible because I need the accurate date of the journey. I've got four children and have to organise their time without  mother. Furthermore, I would like to know exactly which kind of clothes I have to take with  and how much money I'll be supposed to spend there. I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Edith-Marilyn Piaf  [SEP]  Shopping is  my everyday life. I'm a mother of four children and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (monstruous) and goes on with clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But unlikely to what you could think, I love shopping. I find it a very relaxing moment. At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressful because of your children  always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you're seeing. Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream! To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one disadvantage on shopping: you need money! You'll understand, I'm sure, that I prefer shopping at the beginning of every month. In order to change this situation I could win the lottery: a dream too! ",29.0
57," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing in response to your advertisment in Today's newspaper. I recently spent two days at the International arts festival and I found it very entertaining. It was really a good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows. The idea that I prefered the most was to suggest a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student or unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money. I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, he concert hall was too small. Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries. A friend of mine went to see the play ""Hamlet"" and the film ""Gladiators"". He told me how great it was and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year. In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in  sommer. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Two sisters, Alex and Daniela were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found any present for their mother. Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and  only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister. After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold. In deep of herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it. Unfortuneatly, Daniela fainted. She was so cold that she couldn't move her legs. Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angle appeared. He asked Alex if it was more important to bring back a present at home or to save her sister. The answer was obvious and the angel saved Daniela.. This story happend a long time ago. ",35.00
616," Dear Mr. Ryan: I am writing in connection with the information requested, concerning the two-week trip I have won in the competition. Firstly, I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go. About accomodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in  tents as I believe  is the right type of accomodation for going camping? Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot. I actually have much resistance and balance so that will help me in both activities. Now, I would like to request some information about clothes and money. What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me? I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will helpful towards the preparation for the weeks in subject. Yours sincerely Gabriela Matos  [SEP]  Right size, right colour Men tease women as being shop-cravers and for having shopping as the nicest passtime. However that impression is not always true. Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your  doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large. What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress. Finally, you always talk yourself into some piece of clothing but that ended up being a tiring day of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc. Is that enjoyable? ",35.0
632," Dear Mrs Ryan! I'm very happy that I won first prize in your competion. Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing about I dreamed a lot. You asked me few questions in your letter. I would like to answer. The only one term for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA on July becouse on August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights in hol. on July are hot. Tent will be more cooler to sleep  then the cabin. You offer a great veriety of activities. My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball. I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer. Basketball is the game which I love. I always watch the NBA matches on T.V. It will be great for me to train basketball in  USA. I have qustions to. How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are requested Thank You. Yours sincerely K.  [SEP]  Shoping is not always enjoyable. Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops. We could only buy things from Russia. People alwas queued for stuff from  west. If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night. It was the worst side of shopping in Poland  couple  years ago. Nowadays we have capitalism, free market lots of privete shops, markets and super-markets. We can buy everything what about we imagine. Polish super market are not Polish origin shops. They are imported from enother Western Europe country. I apprieciate this shops for lots of products, cheep prices end big spaces. But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread. On Friedy evening and at on the weekdays each supermarkets are crowded. They are filled by people who went buy everything. I do not like crowded places. This is the reason why I do not like shopping. ",27.0
1150," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I read your letters and I'm ready to help you. I think that we have to think  which hotel is better for the students. I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me. I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it's very nice and cheap. It has comfortable bedrooms and  place for parties. You can book this hotel it's the best and it's near to  conference it's only 15 minutes by walk. I think that it will be nice about the end-of-conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance. The party it will be nice. The clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart, not how you are going to  casino for example but nice casual, not with sports shoes or T-shirts. On the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places. Those are my ideas for the conference. I hope that you will like it. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Today our article it will be about an inventions that we need inour life. I think that all this things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things. First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make  call if you need something of if it something happend to your house and nobody is next to you. The second one is the lamp, the electricity that is very important in our life. In the past the people didn't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire. It's important to have electricity because without this you can't do anything. The other one is the television. You must have  TV because you can liten  what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you didn't go . You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have  free time. The boat it's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places. The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want. In this year the familys they have 3 cars in one family one by one person. For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you can't do anything, it's part of my life. ",21.00
56," Dear Jane, I am writing to you to give you some advice about the International Arts festival. I think it is a great idea to organise this sort of festival because most of people enjoy it. Firstly, concerning  stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics like jazz and rock it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about  bigger halls, it will be better. Secondly, about  plays and films it will be good if you make more because the children like it. The dance shows was very wonderful like art exhibitions. Do not change about  talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their owns books. Finally, concerned the price for the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less stress, so they can visit  more longer. It will be better, if we can make this festival at the end of summer. I hope  to give you enough information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It began when my parent sand I were going to the South of France for  holidays. We took a  car. When we were near Geneva, my father who was driving the car, had been flashed by a radar and the police stopped him. After that,  it maked a long time that he drove, so we decided to stop to an  area. We were going to the toilet and ate something to the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he forgot to close the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggages. We called the police but they said  us  if you didn't close your car we didn't make something. It was  the worse holiday in my life but we continued. When we arrived at the flat, it was eleven o'clock. The agency was closed and we hadn't  the key. We went to an hotel, it was expensive and uncomfortable. Finally,  the life in France are crasy, this is the tradition. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00

As far as accomodation is concerned, I would prefer sleeping in a tents. I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accomodation is part of the ritual. I would enjoy a lot playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good in it. In addition I would love to follow the photography classes eventhough I have never tried to take a picture before. I hope I gave you all the information you needed.

I've done so many thinks and between them I went to Glastonbery (as you know)! It lasted three days and I've had the best fun of my life. I went as a voluntier staff in order to go for free. I had to help the Green Peace teems to recycle everything we could. We were more or less two hundred students doing the same job. Our duty was to work eight ours each day and then we were free to enjoy the rest of the day as we liked. The accomodation and the food were part of the contract... everything free. They provided us  tents and also a VIP pass in order to get food. Oh my God!!! It has been the best experience you can Imagine. I met lots of nice and cool people, and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmospher of the hole thing. No matter how hard we had to work, everyone had always humor and  a positive mood.

Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing. I love swimming and also I've got a scubar diving licence. I used to enjoy floting on the water whenever I was on holiday. Singing is the most favarite hobby for us. We often go out to sing in  Karaoke bar. My son experienced winning the first prize in a Karaoke competition. I'd like to know that how much monery,  how many clothes we need. It would be grateful if you sent me more details I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Hana Soma  [SEP]  First of all we can't go shopping without money. Nowadays, most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development. Despite the poor material of product, we have to pay much money, even though we  completely satisfied  shopping at that time, we sometimes regret buying after the shopping. It sounds like foolish. However it often happen. Secondary the customer's service often makes us angry. Of couse, the shopkeepers are human being as well. But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines. So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy. I sometimes loose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly behaviers. Moreover, shopping is just a part of life style. It's necessary to buy something to alive. We have to buy for some thing. For example, for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on. Even when the risk comes up with shopping. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable for us ",24.0
246," June 17th, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show 'Over the Rainbow' permormed on the Circle theatre last week. To begin with, there were no discounts available, and nobody seemed to be able to explain the reason . Second, the musical started forty-five minutes later! and, to make matters worse, the actor was not Danny Brook as the advertisement said. The new actor was not as good as Danny Brook, and he did not perform  the show as he should have done. Finally, I found that the theatre restaurant was closed because there had been problems with one of the ovens. What was suppoused to be a perfect evening out turned  to be  disappointing one instead. I am afraid something should be done about this, and I urge you to refund my ticket. I am looking forward to receiving your response. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It is often said that technology has changed our lives in many ways, and that we live better now. However, technology has also brought many problems to Society. Technology brings  me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier. If I want to know how a friend is, I just have to phone him; I can see how the world is going on only by switching on the television, and I can cook in  some minutes using the Microvelle oven. However, there are a lot of negative aspects in the way that technology affects my life. As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job. In conclussion, I think that technology has two faces which affects my life as well as everybody else's life. I believe that we should try to change this bad aspects, or learn to live with them.

I love travelling when the weather is warm. About the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins, because for me and my family's more comfortable. I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in  log cabins. I'd like spend all of  time in a swimming-pool because I love swimming. I like also surfing, because I love the wind in the hair and the fresh on my body. Only one question about a baby's accomodation. May I have a babysitter?

First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month. Do you remember which is my favourite group? So, You don't believe me, but I enjoed helping at a Oasis's pop concert. I was a great and wonderful experience. The group needs to found a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert. Me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when I understood  was happing on the stage, I decided to help them. Of course you know, I'm a singer, so I came back quigky to my home, I picked  my microphone, and I handed it to the singer. The concert was absolutely fantastic. I was so glad, because in the ending of  show the singer kissed me and dedicated to me a lovely song. Can you immagine? Ok, write  me soon, huge hug and kisses Yours Irene ",29.0
718," Dear Helen, I have just received your letter which made me so happy and I am writing to apply  your questions. First of all, I can travel only  July because my son's school is going to finish at the end of June, so it is impossible for me to travel during on June. Apart from that I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year so July is the best choice for me. I would rather stay in  tents because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family. I have always loved camping. My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it. I have been taking photographs since I was 17. I took some lessons and after that I have really improved it. Beside this, I am very good at playing basketball. I used to play in  high school's team. Also, I have some questions. I have never been to California before so I have no idea about the climate. Could you please give me some information about it and what kind of clothes should I bring for my holiday. Besides, I really would like to know, approxiametely how much money should I take with me? Is it an expensive city? I hope all those information will help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am so sorry that I couldn't write  you last week. As you know, I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked  as a director's assistant during the last week. First of all, it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer's name before who is called Tina. As a director's assistant my job was  arrangement of the audience's seats and tickets. All seats were brought from a sponsor company. Everyday I worked for two hours in a shop to sale tickets. It was quite enjoyable because everyday I met different people who like listening the  pop music so we had lots of things to talk about. I also helped  the singer's some special demands which weren't so difficult to do. She was very nice and friendly. At the concert night, I worked as well. After the concert I was absolutely exhausted but the thing is I will never forget this experience. I met lots of people who were very famous. The best thing was of course  Tina. We promised each other to keep in touch and she has invited me  her next concert! So, my news are finished. Write me back soon. Love from, ",32.0
91," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writting to you to complain about a theatre play I have seen, called: ""Over the rainbow"". This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons: First of all, I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons  to book a sit. Also, I'm unhappy about the bad informations of your advertisement, which clearly says, the play begins at 19.30 instead of 20.15 as my evening' show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the others spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons  and nobody went to us to apologise or advice us for an other restaurant opened late in the night. That's why, in return of all those problems, I'm asking you to give back some money. I'm looking forward to have an answer from you. Yours faithfully. BOUCHER Jean-Pierre.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry against him and let him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show to his friend that they can believe in him thrutly. For those next  days, Pat will do his best to be the most sympathic as possible. To beginning, every morning Pat says a pleasant ""hello"" in adding to that a big smail. His mother always says: ""If you are smailing and are nice with the people, the poeple would be nice and would smail to you"". As Pat does always what his mother says his friends began to play again with him, but not just his old friends, every body wanted to play with me. The morality of the story is here very clear: be nice with the people and the people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend. ",22.0
291," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW, and also about the servic. When I went to London, during my holiday, I decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW. During and also after the show lots of disappointing thing turned up. Firstly, it was not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove who acted, it was someone else. Sacondly, in your advertisement I read ""Times 14.30 and 19.30"". In fact the show started  20:15 Thirdly, I also read ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"", but the restaurant was closed because of painting. Last but not least, it also says ""discounts available"", but there was not any staff there who could do it. So I am sure that you will understand why I feel so frustrated and disappointed about the whole thing. I look farward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me the money back. Yours faithfully Maris Svensson  [SEP]  ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I was reading when I suddenly hard a big bang. I looked out through the window and saw a big strange ""thing"". It looked like a floating potato, a brown potato. After that a being climed out from the potato. It looked at me and said. ""I am hear to help you. I only need to touch your teacher and you never need to do any homework again."" I could not belive my ears. It was the happiest moment of my life. I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my main-teacher walking through the door with the being after him. The being moved its hand farward and..... Then I felt a big pain in my head and heard ""You can't sleep in the lesson"". I looked up and saw my friend with the coursebook in her hand. Immediantely after I heard ""And don't forget your homework"". I looked at the book and read: ""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets"" ",24.0
710," Dear Helen Ryan I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going to this trip. Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions. I would like to travel in July, as it will be summer, and the weather will be nicer. Accommodation in log cabins would be better for me, because they are more comfortable. One of the activities I will do is tennis, but I am just a beginner, so I would like someone to teach me. The other activity will be photography, which I am very good at. I am wondering if there will be anywhere for me to wash my clothes, or if I will have them washed. I would also like to know how much money I should bring with me. I am waiting for your prompt reply. Yours sincerely, Bradley Tudela.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Many people enjoy going shoppings meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience. The good side of this activity is that it can be a good leisure, provided you are not in a hurry. On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if these were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse. Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience. ",35.0
1187," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter which I received last week. If  student is ill, we will return the money but you should tell us untill one week before we start. And you are staying  the Palace Hotel, which is located in  town Centre. You can take buses or our school buses. It costs forty pence. If you take public buses, it costs more expensive than  school bus. The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock. One of our teacher, who will be voted by student is making  speech for one hour. After,  student is making  speech about what he or she have learned. and diner. In my opinion, you should wear normal cloth. I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on  sixty second floor. There are eye-max cinema, museums,  garelty. This is very famous in our city. I hope that my advice will help you. I look forward to hearing soon from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Pusan Castle Pusan Castle is locted in  South of Pusan. This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan. There are exhibited historcall things, picthurs and clothes. It was built four hundread  ago. When you go up to the top of  castle you can see the whole town. and there are  very big Park in the Castle. Pusan Castle show about Korea history from when one of our King made our country. etc. and there are a lot of facilities in Pusan Castle. Restuarant. Shop specially for group. They can be given  discount. What is more, every places is explained by English. So you do not need pamplat, but, the entrance fee is a little expensive. It cost ten pounds. fortunately If somebody visit  castle over ten people, they give them  discount. ",18.00
1011," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am a student of the FCE class and I am writing to you in name of my class to thank you for the programme about the three days trip to London that you have prepared for us. We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that especially because we will have the possibility to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery. Last week some students of our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March. We would like to go to this show. There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear . In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles. We think that it will be a great opportunity for us to see this show because we are all interested in fashion. For these reasons I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday's afternoon. You can give the possibility to the students too choose between go shopping or go to the show. The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be opened until 7. pm. It is even free for students!! I hope that this change will not cause to you too many problems. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I agree with this statement. I think that famous people deserve to have a private life like all the normal people, without journalists following them all the time. A famous person should have the chance to go on his own for a walk without having the annoying impression of being followed. In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people. They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far. For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death. On the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous. The famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work. In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday. In conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media.

293," Sir manager Yesterday I went to ""The Circle Theatre"" to see the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". I'm very disappointed of this evening. The first thing was, that it started 45 minutes late. And when it finaly started, there wasn't Danny Brook who plaied. There was a different actor and he was really bad. You should have informed us before that you've changed the actor. On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't. After the show I wanted to drink somthing in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started to late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday. So I ask you sincearly for my money back becaus it wasn't a perfect evening out.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her that my parents are getting divorsed and that I will move to Chicago with my mother. We are together in High School in California and this is our last year. We wanted to study biology here in Los Angeles with some other friends but now my plans have changed and I have to leave them. One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me, if I will give a party befor I'll go. I had to tell her that I don't have the time to organise anything becaus we, my mother and I, have to get our stuff ready to move. She wasn't very surprised and soon I've forgotten her question. The year was getting to the end. On Monday in our last week Pat asked me if I want to eat supper at her house. I thought it was a good idea and we went home. But when we get into the hous ther were all my friends! We had a great evening becaus Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! ",25.0
749," Dear Mrs Ryan Thank you for your information. I am very happy to win this prize but also I have some questions about this Camp. I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this Camp on July because for me it is the best time and I can not travel before or after  according to my employer. While this two weeks I would like to stay in  tents because you can be nearer to the nature as you are on  log cabins. I like to go camping. From the activities I choose Basketball and Golf. In Basketball I am very good, because I have played in a Basketball-Team for ten years. But in Golf I am a beginner. I would like to know if it is necessary for me to take some clothes with me for the sport activities? Also I would like to know how much money I should take with me. If you could tell me this answers it would be very nice. Yours sincerely Aydo Ackermann  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good . For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest things like bread and other things to eat. I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes. Also a problem while the shopping is that most  there are so many people and a lot of traffic in all  shopping-centres. All the people are there most on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities for shopping while the week for the employees. I think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet, because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things, and they bring you the things at  home In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.

536," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to thank  for noticing me about the competition and I would be very grateful in giving to you the information  was requiered in your letter. I regret to inform you that I have had some problems in my full-time sales assistant job so, I would rather travel only in July than other months. About the Accommodation I would like you to take careful consideration  that I am ashmatic so, I would appreciatte it if you could reserve a bed in  log cabins. Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can involve through the camping. I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourites ones. I have recently finished a three year course of painting and I always be fascinated by the photography. On the other hand, I would also like to know some about further details like wether we need to bring we us some clothes or  it will be provided to us and if we need some money in case we have to afford something. I hope to see you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi. How do you do? You may be asking why I haven't written to you before. Well, I've been very busy you know. Two weeks ago I enrolled in a group to help on building a stage for a concert of a famous singer star. Activities lasting almost 2 days and a half. The first day we have to move to the airport to bring all the equipment by lorries to the camp. It was really awful and hard. I finished the day too tired. However, the second day was less heavier than the first one. We just worked in building the stage and all those of thing. Putting the instrument in the right place, testing all the microphone as well as the sound was the rest of the job. At the end I must confess that it was really amazing hang up and down all the equipment which varied from small microphone to a marvellous huge large black screen of TV. If you had this oportunitty one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like  just to get a free pass. My regards to your family. Write  me soon. ",26.0
116," Dear Sir, I am writing to explain some aspects about your show. It was a desaster and I am  telling you why. I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, but I had a bad surprise; he was not in the show! How could you change the actors without saying something to the visitors. The show was supposed to start at half past seven and started a quarter past eight. Forty-five minutes later! It was incredible. Apart from that, the advertisement mention that there were discounts available, and there were not. It mention that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show, too, and we could not because it was closed, and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us. I am very disappointed, and if it is possible, I want you to return my money back. I hope that the next time you will do a better show than the last one. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For me technology affects me a lot may be more than science, because my daily life is plenty of objects with technology, such us television, radio, transports, etc. But it has advantatges as   disadvantatges. On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watching television or listening to music. Or if I want to go shopping or to another city, it is necessary to use the car or the public transport. On the other hand there are disadvatatges, too. Firstly, the enviroment is polluted because of technology, although  is our fault. Secondly for us  is a disadvantatge because the pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watching television, and it isn't very good at all. And finally, because I spend a lot of money buying games for the computer, that it's a very good technology, too. To sum up, technology it's the best thing around the world, apart from T.V. ",27.0
1076," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing, on behalf of the students in my class, to thank you very much for the trip to London. Besides  , we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, which was advertised in the newspaper ""Metro"" yesterday. This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 o'clock. All my classmates are very interested in this show, which includes  latest fashions, Leisure and sports wear, Make up, and Hair styles. Moreover, one of the important thing for us is that entrance fee is free for students, because students are generally short of money. We would like to suggest you change  shopping date to Wednesday afternoon, because we have  free time on Wednesday afternoon. We would be very pleased if you could consider our recommendation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Private Life For Everyone. Everyone deserve  private life. However most famous people, for example football player and film stars, have not got any privet life. They feel exhausted to be followed by journalists  Even they have an argue with journalists as they sometimes write unreal news. On the other hand, some people need journalists to be more famous, because people can have news who are famous through journalists. As a result, journalists should respect their life and always write real news. ",19.00
1231," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter. I am sorry about Richard Brown. And I understand that you need help, so that I will help you as far as I can. Firstly, the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference. In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will offer. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference. The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well. Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience in here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals. As you may hear, our city is well known for the musicals. Or, If you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel. Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice. If you have more questions about the conference and something else, do not hesitate to ask me. I would be glad to be able to help you. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined. People do not have the impression on important inventions any more, because they have been getting more popular and common. However, there is something  which  is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention. This is electricity invented by Edison. From my point of view, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines, appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity, which makes people not to too much phisical labour. What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity. In my life, I use electricity in many different ways. At night, I can study because of it. and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry, cleaning rooms and ironing. It makes my life more convenient than that without it. To sum up, although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more, the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed. ",37.00
454," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which gave me a very disappointing evening, while I was staying in London. Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor, Danny Brook. That made me so disappointed. Secondly, I suppose the show will start at 19:30, but it started t 20:15. It caused me missed the train and I went back to the hotel  nearly in the mid-night. Another problem is, I realised that the discounts were available. However, there wasn't any discount. Additionally, the advertisement said I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show. When I arrived, it was closed. That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice. I expected to receive the money back within these two days. Otherwise I would like to take the other action. Your faithfully, Silvie.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrects. I told Pat everything even my secrects when we were still friendly. However, we are not friends anymore because of a secrect in the past. It was a very long time since I was in Year 7. I told Pat that my father and mother were going to seperate. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feeling. May be it was a wrong decision to tell her, she began to spread that secrect to everybody including the teachers. They tried to contact with my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what happened. All my friends were trying to kept a distance with me. That was all because of Pat. At last, I decided to go to the other school and I will not tell any secrect to the others. ",27.0

I would like to know if  is possible for me going on July, because I have school on the others months, and it is impossible for me going on December or January. About the accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins instand of  tents, because  is safer and more confortable. The two activities that I prefer will be Basketball, because I had the experience to play in my school's big for almoust a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I practice since I was ten. On top of everything, I would like to ask how much money should I take, and which type of clothes are the best to wear in the competition. Yours sincerely Elisa F.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable If you are used to go to the Shopping very often, maybe  is because you don't know about all the others good things you can do on your weekend. People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare, it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some movie after that, and if you want buy something at the shops. On the other hand, everything at the shopping is more expensive, because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place. Instand of going to the theather, which is more cultural, or even do a picnic on the Ikurapiura park, people prefer spends all their money at Shoppings. So, why don't we try to change our customs and start to do knew things to enjoy ourselves. ",27.0
681," Dear Sir/Madam I am so pleased to know that I have won such  amazing prize in your competition. I  like to answer the questions you request from me. Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because of this is the month wich I could more likely have off at work for going on holiday. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at  log cabins rather than  tents. That is because I do not want to seem fuzy but I like to have some comodities when I am going on holiday and I think slepping over the floor without electricity it may annoy me. Finally, I  like to choose swimming as  activity in the Camp. I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing that for  long time. On the contrary, painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before, so that I have not any skill in drawing but I  like start doing that know when I have the chance. So that is my second choice. On the other hand, I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful in my holiday like: which type of clothes could be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring something else? If is so, please let me know as soon as possible. to look forward to getting your Reply Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear friend. I am writting to tell you about my experience in the last month pop concert, where I was helping my friend Nick who was the bouncer of the place. That was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona, Julio Iglesias, and people like them That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA. My job it was to accomodate to the people of the main sit of the theathre. Of course those places were reserved just for people well-knowed who wanted to help by joined the concert. So I had to ask them for their identifications and for their invitations. After that, I have to take them to their respective sit. At first, I was a bit scare, I mean I was afraid  not be good enough to have a good performance as  assistant; but finally every thing went well. I should say that it was the easiest and more interesting job that I have ever done. I really enjoyed it and also I did not miss the opportunity to ask the artist to take a photho with me. So, I hope to see you earliest to show  all my phothos. I think, it was very cleaver of me to record that moment wich I will never ever forget, and that was the think that I more liked of that experience.

We would like to request if we could go to this show on the 15th March instide off  the visit in the Science Museum. We could make this one on the Wednesday 15th March afternoon. Thank you in advanced for your comprehention and we look forward to hearing for you. Yours Sincerely,   [SEP]  The private life of famous people! Who have never dreamed  to be a famous singer, sportman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so big that they are known all over the World. I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be quiet because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them. They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do. In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life. Firstly, because it is a lot of ""scandale magazine readers"". Secondly,  because they have  admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a ""star life"" look like. In conclusion I think that people who are to much interested in other people life have not an interesting life and are unhappy!  ",27.00
602," 1th, June, 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter and I am so glad to win the prize. Thank you very much! In answer  your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have begun painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will I get any tuition? Finally, I should like to ask some questions. How is the weather like in California in July? What kind of clothes should I pack? If I want to buy some gifts, how much money should I take and can I use traveller's cheques in every place? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our lives are getting better and better, so people began to go shopping more frequently. It's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us  good apart from the temporary satisfaction? Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In  fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under  these tricks. The result,  we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty. Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they? Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out it won't be always enjoyable.  ",37.0
700," Dear Ms Helen Thank you very much for your letter letting me know that I have won your first prize. I am writting to you in order to give you some details you asked me for in your letter. First of all, I need to tell you that it is only possible for me to travel in July, because I am going to move to Spain in August. About my accommodation prefers, I would really like to be in a tent. Everytime I travel around, I sleep in nice rooms with nice beds; that is why I think it is a good option to sleep in sleep-bags. From the activities I can choose to do in these two weeks, I would enjoy playing basketball and climbing. I think it would be funny to play basketball after  five years; and since I go out to the mountains once a month, I don't think I would have any problem with climbing. I would like to ask you some questions: Could you tell me what kind of clothes would be addecuate for these two weeks? How much money do you think I should bring with me? Thank you once again for your attention and interest. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Gloria Ortega  [SEP]  Dear Kim You are going to be jealous when you hear this. As I told you in my last letter, I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert. The pop group were all young people (between 23 - 30 years old), and all of them were really nice. Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people), consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,... The job was hard, but from my point of view, it was worthful. I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun. Every five working hours, we had thirty-minutes break to eat something. We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons. The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day . That was fantactic! If you have never been there, I enormous recemmend you to go. Even I played the drums there! I hope your exams are doing well, and you write me back when you finish them. Lots of love ",30.0
883," Dear Sir or Madam, I have received your letter about the prize I have won in your competition. I would like to thank you and give some   information you asked about me. Re  time: I am a student and have examinations until the end of June. The only convinient time to travel is in July. I hope you can arrange this. Re accommodation: I would like to stay in a log cabin. I have had sleeping and breathing problems in tents which were serious. I hope to avoid these this time. Re activities: During the two weeks I would like to do tennis and swimming. I regularly play tennis since I was nine years old and I entered several competitions. Swimming is another sport I learned when I was six. I have a few questions about the camp. Are the meals free or do I have to pay for it? Do you have a choice of food? I'm vegetarian and can't eat any milk products. What kind of clothes will I need? Are there any special clothes you suggest? I'm looking forward to your reply Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I'm glad to hear that you have found a job. I want to apologize for writing so late, but I had a lot of work to do. Do you remember the concert I helped at. It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 am. to let them in the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert orginazer wanted to know the exactly number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my place and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and couts of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things  with them, like knifes or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard. It was a great experience. I had a serious duty and also a lot of fun. I met new people which I still see. I would like to introduce them to you. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Love ",39.0
774," Dear Mrs. Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you for the letter which brought me such good news. I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to apreciate the travel I won. Secondly, I will give you with pleasure some information about myself you need to have. To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only in the end of June. As an accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been doing camping for years and enjoy it very much. As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp, I will choose singing which I am very good at and swimming which I am fond of but unfortunately, not a professional. In the end I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also the sum of money I will need... during my vacation. I wish you all the best and look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely yours, Lena Kazanova  [SEP]  A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men of the world would never believe that in my opinion, shopping is really not always enjoyable. Eternal crowds, high prices, long hours of choosing a suitable thing, that is what shopping means to me. Especially, I can't support to do shopping with my mother: it takes so much time that later I regret of agreeing to go with . When I am on my own, everything is fine: I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours to choose what I really want either for myself or someone else. Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way  to do it. Some go just to kill the time others - to look at something new, I am in the third group - previously I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need. But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day looking for my mother in a huge department-store. ",32.0
1086," To Mr Robertson, Firstly, I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided. It was  very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class would enjoy. However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend. It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March. It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm. The show will be about all the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students. This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them. The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go. I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show. Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show. I hope you would consider this matter. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Everyday, something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books, dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a  plier, even homes are effected. From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves, but we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old, outdated and changed. I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers. We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door. Although all that may change our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style. We might still favour that old carpet and couch. The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too. In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc. Never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other with the same purpose. Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen, it will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two. Lastly, I think that all this changes won't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead  abruptedly. People will be able to adjust and change with the times. ",37.00
997," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got a prize for a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA. Due to my business, I am very busy and that it is the best moment for my business so, I can't manage my time to go on holiday but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go on swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning swimming for the last eight months and I really enjoyed it. Another sport I experience is Basketball which I used to play for a school's team when I studied at secondary school. I have not been practising it at all recently but only wish I had. This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again. I wonder if you could answer me some questions? Have you had any recommendations  what type of cloths should I take with me? Do you suggest me to take cash or can I used my credit card? Will there be any tour-guide during the trip? I thank you again for your assistance and am looking forwards to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely, Prasert Charoenkul  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It has been quite a long time since I last written to you. I hope you are well. I have something really exciting to share with you. There was a concert of Michael Jackson in my city last month. It was a charity concert which was organised by a university  I am studying. My classmates and I, we were asked to do decorating the stage,  cleaning the concert's area. But guess Kim, what was the most exciting  for us was, we were asked to be the singer's interviewer. It wasn't a spokeperson Kim but just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage. I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say. If you imagined yourself talking to the most famous pop singer such as him how would you feel? But what I really enjoyed on that evening was when we took a photographs with him after his concert and he signed it for us on the back side of each picture. We had a wonderful evening. His concert was absolutely brilliant. Everyone was screaming, shouting and dancing while he was singing. I wish you were here with us. Are there anything wondering happen over there? Please write  me when you have time. I am looking forwards to hearing from you. Love, Prasert Charoenkul ",31.0

1006," Dear Mary, I'm really happy to hear from you! I've had so much work at school recently (exams!) and so many things to do, that I've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit. Fortunately, the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones. The boat trip you're asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you: The departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours. I think such a tour is essential, because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle. After visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant, but you'd better take  picnic - it's so beautiful there! In the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake. Try windsurfing, you'll have lots of fun! I'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it. Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount. Try it and have fun! I'm looking forward to hearing from you, take care,  [SEP]  It was three o'clock in the morning when the phone rang. I rushed to answer it, but when I picked up the phone, there was nobody there. ""Stupid teenagers again"" - I thought angrily, climbing the stairs to my bedroom. Suddenly, I heard some strange sound behind me. I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound disappeared. I began feeling a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had this impression that something was wrong. I stopped and listened. Nothing. A complete silence. After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again. There was nobody . But something changed - the kitchen door was wide open. Suddenly I saw a figure of a man, dressed in black, moving towards me. I couldn't believe my own eyes, so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister's room. ""Jane"" - I shouted - ""There is a ghost downstairs! A man, dressed in a black suit!"" ""I know"" - replied my little sister peacefully, - ""It's Grandpa. Don't you know it's his birthday today?"" ""Yes, but our grandpa is dead, don't you remember?"" - I cried. ""That's right. But haven't you just said you've see a GHOST?"" - she asked and looked at me as if I had lost my mind. ",40.00
317," Sir/Madam, I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening during your musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director. First of all, the actor was expected to be Danny Brook. He is my favourite actor and the most important reason I went to your theatre. But finally, without telling us anything, there was a different actor. This was very disappointing. Secondly, your famous restaurant was closed. That was very displeasured because I had planned a romantic dinner with my wife. If you had told me your restaurant was going to be closed, I would have made a reservation anywhere else, but you didn't. And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were not discounts available. Both things do not agree with what I read on your advertising sign. Due to all of these reasons, I hope you could give  my money back. Yours sincerely, MANUEL ALMODAR  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking in going away from home. This was a very difficult decission but I had to take it because of my personal situation, all the time shouting and fighting will all my family. Therefore my girlfriend lived alone so I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world. I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend. But it was a big mistake because she told it to her mother and I don't know how but now my mother know  it, and she is very worried about me and my future. And my father thinks a year travelling and living by myself will be very good for me. Finally, my parents are all the time argueing about differents solutions to my problem, and this all thanks to Pat. ",34.0
63," 25th November 2000 Dear Mr Clark, I have seen your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday. Most of the events were wonderful and well-organised. I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my inmature views of it. Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves,  also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all  events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is  really economical  to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that  was his cheapest weekend. Moreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some  concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect. This are only my inmature views, if it is considerable for you, I will be very pleased, thank you very much. I'm look forward to hearing your replies. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  16, Dec. 2000 Dear Yasmin, It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday, you asked me about rules; both at my home and at my school, I am very happy to tell you about this. At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood, it tend to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use  Internet, there are only ten computers in the school, only teachers can use it, if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school. At my home, there are many rules, because I'm careless, so I amn't allowed to smoke at home as well: and I'm not allowed to use  telephone, because last year I made  £1000 bill for one month, my parents were very angry with it, so they told me I am not to use  telephone any more, oh, How poor! How is the weather like in England, I hope it isn't too wet, please give my regards to your parents. Lots of love, ",26.00
1021," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing, on the name of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you give us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications in the programme. The programme you has already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination between cultural visits and more relaxed activities. But, in another hand, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which includes a range of different stands. The only day we can attend to this show is the Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall. We are really interested in visiting this unhabitual show and the main advantage is that the entry is free for students. In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly after the Science Museum to the show. We all agree that we have enough time in Wednesday for shopping. I hope that you will agree with this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists fellowing them all the time Famous people have always been the center of interest for  number of people. Their wedding, their holiday, their new haircut and so on. But do we think enough about the right to have a private life? We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do politics or  movies! But from the other, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities. In conclusion, I would say that both parts, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules. As public people, stars and politicians have to accord some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful. ",31.00

You won't have any problem to find the college because it's in front of the Hotel, and the conference will be there. As you know, the conference will start at 11:00 and it will finish at 13:00, but we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college's hall until 14:30. You'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers, if you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket. When we had finished you'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room, but if you prefer other things, we've got a swimming pool and a library, it will  your own choice. I hope it was useful for you.

Fuengirola has a wonderful and beautiful castle which is right on the sea front. It is placed on the top of a little hill which is part of the beach. You can't lose the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs. At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a breake to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea, it is also amazing. Also, there is a museum of history inside. As you see, you have to visit the castle, you won't feel regret about that. Your sincerley, ",22.00
720," Tuesdy 13th, June, 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition. I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month. About accommodation, I would prefer  log cabins, because I have a problem in my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not fairly comfortable. As far as camp activities  concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing. On the other hand, I  keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it. Finally, I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California? In addition, could you advice me how much money I need for the trip? and is there anything else do I have to know? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  13/06/00 Hello Kim, I've received your letter two days ago and I'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I'm ok and let me tell you about my last experience. I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me  an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it. He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while. I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very simply. I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail. Well my friend, I have to go, because I  got an appoinment with the Dentist. Write  me soon and take care. Best wishes ",22.0
960," Dear MRS HELEN RYAN. I am very pleased with the prize that I won and I would like to give you more information about it, because I would really really like to go to California, I have always wanted to go to California. First of all, I'm very ill at the moment and I need about a week to get better and I would like to travel within the next few weeks if  is possible (July 2000). In accodance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents, because I think their unusual and  is not something that you do everyday. You have also asked me to give you two activities (sports) which I would like to do while I am at the camp. The kind of activities that I like from the list that you gave me are Basketball and Swimming. I would also like to ask you about the weather to see what kind of clothes shall I take with me. On the other hand I don't know how much money I should take. Is the food paid for? What about all the other expenses like gas, electricity, water and all the others. May I ask you to bring me some more information about the question that I have asked you ? Thank you very much about your letter Yours SINCERELY  [SEP]  Dear Mrs Andersen I would like to give you, and the others in the class my opinion (for the video that you are going to do) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why. Well, in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but  in real life are useful, are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we must all know WHERE we live, what are the problems that we have in this world, what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for  it and  the gold as well, there are loads of thinks about geography that we MUST KNOW. In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video film. You can put  a few activities (sports) like basketball, football,  tennis, but only those because their are very popular and people will have interest on them. My advise for you is: ""Do not put  to much subjects, just put  a few subject and make them look interesting"" Yours SINCERELY ",24.0
855," Hello, I'm so glad I won this prize, but I have some questions for you, and of course, the answers you asked me . Well, at first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holidays here in Portugal. And if it's possible I would like to go after day 10th, because I've got some things to do. And for me, I think  tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at log cabins, and when I was sleeping  felt some thing moving in my skin, then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why! About activities, I enjoy most painting, because I am a plastic artist since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art. And the other activity is singing. Everybody says I have an excellent voice, I like to sing when I painting too, it's so relaxing. Is that enough? I would like to ask what kind of clothe I probably will use there? And how much clothe? A lot, or  few? And what about money? Will I spend much? If you could tell me about this, I'll be glad! Greatefully Teresa J. Pereira  [SEP]  Dear Tina, You won't believe what I'm going to tell you! Remember when I told you I helped someone important? Well, listen to this. I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop. (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday) when I found a beautiful store, I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window  (outside), then I thought  interesting and came in. Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face. I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome. And then he said ""if you promise me you won't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I take this cap off of my face"". I didn't know what to do, I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murther! Then I said ""OK, I promise!"" (frightened, of course). Carefully, he took off the cap. Tina, guess WHO was he? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael. Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one. Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record. Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos. Love, Teresa. ",33.0

I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays   this month since last January. I want if it is possible a log cabins like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood, therefore I need a confortable accommodation.

I also choosed painting because I have never done  before, I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calm activity. Otherwise, could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for the food, please? Yours sincerely. Xavier Fournier  [SEP]  How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping? Sometimes, they are happy to do shopping. but why? Therefore, shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case. Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone. In fact you try to get a present to make  receive happy. Shopping is also good, when you know what you want. For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops. In the opposite, shopping can be disenjoyable. Shopping is boring if you go with people  too fussy. That is to say, they are never happy with what they get and see. They always find a problem. Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops. It is stupid, they do not have any goal. They waste their time. To conclude, I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Even if I like to do shopping with some people and  kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time. ",26.0
816," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter which informed me that I have won the first prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Here are some information as requested. Please noted that I can only travel in July because of  summer holiday shut down. It would be any day but please let me know nearner the time. I would prefer the log cabins than tents. I think the log cabin is more fun & exciting. The activities that I would like to do are painting and playing a Golf. I have won a first prize for painting when I was at High School, and won a third prize of playing Golf for a Charity. Could you please tell me for what sort of clothes do I need and how much money to take. I look forward to hear from you and if you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Yours sincerely Sunee Boonliang-Hampson  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is an ordinary way of life. We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruits, milk and etc. At least most people will do their shopping twice a week for a fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it  always enjoyable. You have to try to park your cark first which sometime the space are fulled and after you have parked your car and went in the supermarket the product you wanted have run out so you have to changes your plan for dinner or going to another supermarket to facing a long queue. that make you whole day for shopping which was not fun at all.

1219," Dear Marie, I am sorry to hear that our friend Mr Brown is ill. As our conference is due to start next week I respond straight away. There are some informations you have asked me about. We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel. That is the best option because it is placed less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center. When you live a hotel you have to turn right and you bloun the street. At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building. That's our Conference Center. At the hotel reception you will find printed information  how to get over there. As you know at the end-of-conference there is a party. Party is due to start at 8 p.m  until 3 a.m. There is  2hr break between  end-of-conference and  party. At this time you and your group can refresh yourself. I would like to mention that because  our conference that is dress-code party. Hope you will enjoy it. We prepared some special attraction like live dance music and  hot or cold buffet. About you're the last question I can sugest to visit the Royal Castle. That will give you and your guests an impression about our country and history. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  In our town there is so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one. In my opinion the most interesting is the Castle. It is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it. Just look up and you will see that huge building. Actually it is a whole complex, the Old and the New Castle,  Cathedrall and the most interesting undergroud part with it's amazing crypts. And if you climb on the top of the main tower - the keep  you will see unforgetable view on a white toun. After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle. You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon, armores and, we are especially pround of it, the great collection of swords. After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle . I am sure that should be enought for  one day trip. For you information I can say that at this time we have  five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display. That should complete that amazing day. ",25.00
1112," Dear Mr. Robertson, The trip that you planned for us, students, it's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London. Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events. We'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated with our school and the students that study there. It's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions. But there's something that I'd like to ask. The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday. It's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions, of the new hairstyles,  of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to  make up. Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon. By this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion . Thanks for the attention and we're waiting for your answer. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous People x  Media Famous people are special for the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information. The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people. It's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect . Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer . In summary, the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems. The respect is essential. They deserve to have a private life like any common person. ",27.00
446," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should be one of the stars, instead there was one for me totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start. Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there was no discounts what so ever and finally, because of a shortage of staf, your restaurant was not available for us. This event was not what I call: ""a perfect evening out"", as your advertisement promised. I feel entitled to compensation for this event. I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take your responsibilities. Yours faithfully Carolina Patharius  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so stupied, telling her my secret after all I  been going through to keep it to myself. But now when the story was out, it was just to start to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around and worring about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face. I decieded to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lession. That evening I went to her house. I pretended to be totaly miserable. Pat didn't know what to do, she apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated. Finally I smiled. After huging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets. Especially not if it has to do with failing all  exams.... ",31.0
954," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I'm writing  you replying to your letter asking for some more information about me, to give you all the information you need. First of all you asked when would I be able to travel. You ought to know that  is possible to me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole  August. Answering the second question I would prefer my accomodation  in log cabins. The reason is that, in my opinion, they are more comfortable, there's more space and in addition they are warmer. Providing that you give me the chance to chose two activities I would love to do swimming and singing. I attend to swimming and singing classes twice a week so I'm really good at both. Finally I would like to ask you about clothes and money. Where will we be able to wash our clothes during the camp? Are we allowed to carry with  all the money we wish to? Don't hesitate to contact me for any more question. Yours sincerely, Angeles.  [SEP]  Nowadays shopping is considered one of the most usual and enjoyable activities, especially if you are a woman and you are out to buy clothes. At first sight it is, but shopping is not always enjoyable. Basing my opinion on my experience I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping. There are some points that give me the reason. First of all, who is your companion? If you take  mum shopping the right day she has been all day doing housework, that will probably end in discussion. In one hand, there's you. You are feeling sick,  angry with your boyfriend. How do you pretend to see in a mirror that anything fits well on you? In the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, no   size for you or too high prices. Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping journeys? I'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it. ",30.0
4," Dear Jane Clark, the organiser of  International Arts Festival I'm one of the citizen that enjoyed the last International Arts Festival. Most of  attractions are excellent, but I'd like to point out that  ""quality is high, but  quantity is not enough!. First of all, the only ""six countries"" doesn't mean ""around the world"". I suppose you had difficulty to manage the schedule. Second, some concert hall were too small, so some  audience couldn't concentrate  to listen to the music. And others couldn't enter the hall. But  ""All in one ticket"" was a good idea. In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is  wasting  time. I pressume if the term becomes longer the festival become more excellent. Because it's easy to manage the artist schedule and  audience can enjoy the live. I'd like to go to the Festival again!  [SEP]  Thank you for your letter. And I'd like to answer for your question. AT first, in Japan, generally school rules are more strictly than  home's. The gap between them is tremendously big! I can say the action which is prohibitted at school is no problem at home. Because the purpose of school rules is not only  discipline but also unify. Here, I write down one of the rules at my school. ""Whenever the students wear an extra  cloth (because of  cold or something) his or her (not  students!) parents write down an application form with their authorized signatures"". You will ask me why, the reason is the above...""unify"". In addition ""the students must not use any commercial paper bags (received at  department store etc)"". Now you know the reason! Needless to say I'd like to change such ridiculous rules, because such rules are not for us. They are for teachers'! Don't you think so? Do you have any rules at school that make you upset? If you have please tell me. Yours faithfully ",22.00
1176," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference on your letter concerning an organization of an international student conference in Wimbledon Art College. Below I am clarifying some information you asked about. First of all, I would like to give you more information about  name and location of the hotel. The group has been booked into  ""Maria Luisa"" hotel which is situated on the center of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village. This hotel is the next building after  Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place. Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is planed to be in Wimbledon Common -  nice piece of England nature. So, it may be a good idea to take some very comfortable and informal clothes. Thirdly, talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area, I would suggest you to visit  Wimbledon Museum of Tennis. Where is quite  good exposition their, giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon Tennis Tournaments. I look forward to meeting your group in our conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Report. Introduction: The purpose of this report is to give a brief discription of the Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg. From my point of view this building is the best option to visit. Location: This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of  Niva River with an exellent view on the Hermitage Museum. History: The building was built by  very famious Russian architect and is a marvellouse example of Russian classic architerture of  XVIIIth century. Facilities: In the Academy of Art you can find the oldiest art libarary with a wide range of books,  the Museum of Russian Art with a huge collection of painting, sculpture and architectural projects from  early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries. It is also a good chance to be introduced with  Russian system of art education. Conclusion: The building of  Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting as  historical as educational aspects. ",27.00
515," Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing  you to show my disagree about the musical show 'Over the rainbow. First, I am very dissapointed with the starring. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike. Also, the musical did not start at 19.30, it started forty-five minutes later. That is why,  it finished later and I arrived late to a basketball match. Another thing is that there were not any discounts in the entrance fee. Finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because it was sunday. It is closed all sundays, you have to say it. That is why I will be pleased if you give  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why I didn't want to tell him that I had failed my natural science final exam. I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed, before we were on holidays, they will cancelled the trip to Africa. But, I need to say it to someone, so I told it to Pat. The next day, all the class knew  it. I wasn't too worried because if someones is going to see my parents, I would tell them before not talk about the exams. But, when my mother was talking with Pat's mother and she mentioned it,  my mother cancelled the trip to Africa. It wasn't Pat fault, it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and also, I knew that Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",26.0
465," Dear Sir, My name is Yakimo Nashoto, I study in France and I went to London just to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because all my friends told me that it was ""great"". However, when I saw it, I was really disapointed and I  ask you  some money back. The reasons why I was disappointed were : First of all, Danny Brook was not there, I was very upset because he is my favorite singer and it was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show. Then, the show started t 20.15 pm instead of 19.30. My Euro Star was at 22 pm. As you can see, I missed my train to go back to Paris. On the developpement, they also said that they will be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but it was totally wrong because I paid the full price which was £20. Finally, I wanted to buy something to drink,  the restaurant was closed because it was on a bank holiday! As a conclusion, it was the worse evening I have ever had in my life so I  ask you for  money back. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my daily life a lot. First of all,  Internet makes my life easier. Some of my friends live in overseas, we keep in touch by e-mails, it is a very good way for communicating because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read mails and keep them forever. Then, nine persons out of ten have a mobile phone in our society. I have one too! It is very useful for several reasons: when I want to call someone, I don't need to look after a phone box. people can phone me at anytime they want from everywhere when I go out, sometimes my parents are worried so they phone to me  if everything is going alright. Finally, there is a TV in my parent's car. We can watch TV, there is also a map so when we get lost, it is very east to find out the place. As a conclusion, I agree that modern technology has changed my daily life but I am sure that in the future, my life will not be the same as now because more modern technology will appear.  ",29.0
1224," Dear Mrs Maria Smith. I was really pleased to receive at your letter. Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can. So, I'm writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for. Firstly, we've booked Palace Hotel, which is located in Central. The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using  tube because it takes only 20 mininute. The tube is 2 line which is red colour. And your speach would be better for the end of conference party. I'd suggest you to wear at least, semi formal wears such as a jacket with another clothes. Finally, I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area. The museum can be helpful to understand our country's history and art. I look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,   [SEP]  Computer is the most important invention in our life. Some people might say the electricity  more important than  another thingh. It's hard to say which is the most important invention. However, I'd say  computer is  more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone, the car. Recently  computer is really necessary and we can't manage to work without them. Not only is for bussiness, but also in for my life. For instance, when I want to contanct with to my friend, it's quite helpful by using e-mail. Before  computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact with to foreign countries at the same time. And also it's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computer more than before. Despite  amazing invention, some times  computer makes  big problem, such as  millennium bug (some people called   ""2000 problem""), because computer  not flexible enough like a human's brain. However,  computer is worth to use in our life until  more coveniance machine will be invented. ",20.00
897," Dear Mrs Ryan, In reply to your letter recieved  the 13rd of June, I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been choosed. First of all, you've asked me when I wanted to travel. In fact their would be only one possibility in July because I will end with my exams session at the end of this month and beginn a practical trainning the 1rst of August. To continue with the others information you need, I would prefer to sleep in  tent because of the proximity to the nature. Furthermore, I've choosed two activities whose are Sailing and Climbing. I've climbed for 3 years as I was at school and I think that my level is still not too bad. In contrary, I've never sailed in my life and would enjoy to start with at Camp California. To end with, I would like to know how much money we will need for the free time and what kind of clothes and materials do I need to practise the activities I've choosed. I would like to thank you for all, and am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely Victoire Bouchard  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I've well received your last letter and want to thank your for the pictures you've joined with. You've asked me how was the Leysin Rock Festival, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and unexpectable it was. As you know, I was there to help for the good running of the concert and there was a lot of different things to do. First, I had to control the tickets at the entry. In addition, there were some VIP's to place. Then, during the concert I've helped to serve the beers at the bar. I've met a lot of interresting people while I was serving . Furthermore, I had to make announcements at the loudspeaker for the children who where lost. All was very interresting, but what I particularly liked about the experience is the human relations. I've met a lot of different people and they all have learned me something new about behaviour or compation. I hope we will see us as soon as possible and  am waiting for your answer.

299," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to you in order to describing my last visit in your theater. Unfortunatly I am a very disappointed about  organisation in your company. Firsty the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price  £20 because discounts were not available although on your advertisement there were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the grateful Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and it was singing a mother unknown person. And last but not least I recognised after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come... I don't know  it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatrer that  is promised much more then the people can get for their money, or  it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I am not agree with such  situation and would ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed. I am looking forward for you answering. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously. First of all it changed our life-style. For example ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TV. Because the people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobil and can spend their free-time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more open for the world. Secondely we can do our jobs today more efficient. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our partner faster and better and offer them better service. The ordered goods can be deliver in  shorter time by train, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more for our daily life - for better clothes, furniture, spare time. I am a fan for modern technology. ",23.0

The activities that I would like to do are signing because my friend told me that im good at it. and the other activitie that I would like to do is climbing because I thing it  very exciting although I have never tried climbing. because in my city there are no mountains.

218," Dear Sir/Madam, Further to the umpleasent fact that took place last week I am in my right of complaining about the musical show I saw when I was in London. First of all, when we arrived we went to pay and we gave  a discount ticket. It was not available but the worst thing was that nobody explained us the reason. The show had to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15, then I felt dissappointed because the main actor had been changed. It  had not been such a terrible thing if the new actor would have acted as well as the other one. If it does not seem enough, after the show by boyfriend wanted to invite me to eat something in the theatre's restaurant but the umpleasent surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday. After explaining you my complains I hope you to send me some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was our last school year, so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate  we had finally finished it. We knew that our parents wouldn't let us to travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid they could realize what happened. Kim, Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so, did I. We were excited and we started to organized everything. We booked some rooms in a hotel, next to the beach and we bought all the useful things we were going to need. It seemed  the perfect holiday but it wasn't. Pat was in love with my eldest brother whose name is Jon (I have never got on well with him). Pat told him our idea. Pour Pat, she didn't know my brother, she didn't know how he was. Jon told my parents what we wanted to do. We lost our holidays. ",24.0

1128," Dear Mr Robertson, Firstly, I'm writing to thank you  the great opportunity you give us, especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way. I think that this programme has a good organisation, as you know, due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points. But, I was wondering, like a student of this college, if we would change part of this programme ... we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock. In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the, we can go to the show. Front my point of view, we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear, make up, hairstyles, you know ... I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and   best city to appreciate it. Please let me know if you are agree with us! Oh I forgot about it! Besides, this show is gree (another positiu point). Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE? Do you think you've  the future in your hands? Do you think we're living like  old times? Would you like living in a modern way? What do you expect about the future? Can you compare it ...? Are you afraid? Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes,  to cook to be more comfortable, for example the TV, the video recorder, etc. Maybe, in a few years later we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, from my point of view, I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes. We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer's games for example... But not in the strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars by aereoplanes... In this way, you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing  in the same way you'r changing, too. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening  our lifes. So, we have the future in our hands! Think about it. ",24.00
377," Mr. Manager, I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"", and I was very disappointed after it. First off all I would like to say that it has started later than it should to, I had to wait for about fourty-five minutes. Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show which was very disappoiting for me because I like this actor very much, and I think that I was not the only one who was upset. Another disappointing thing was that that discounts were not available, which made me a bit angry. Why did you write that they were available? I think that the most disappointing think was that  theatre's restaurant was closed. I would to add that I was hungry after the show.  It was not such a perfect evening out. I would rather say that it was a very disappointing evening, and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet at court! Yours sincerlly,  [SEP]  First off all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much. Every day when I get up I am checking if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS in my mobile phone. They are very usefull things which sometimes are nessecary to survive. Modern technology has got a big influence on our life. It is easier. We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones which are the best things ever made. I use them very often in my daily life. I THINK THAT TELEVISION HAS the biggest influence on our daily life. I watch about four hourers  TV a day, I even eat my meals in front of the TV. We can see PEOPLE'S LIFE in other countries which is very interesting for me and my friends. Also  Iternet has  influence on my daily life, beause I can find there many interesting things, or I can meet with people from all over the world which is exciting for me. I think that life with out modern technology would be simple and borring that's why I am using it in my daily life, I am happy that there is such  thing as modern technology. ",26.0
768," Thank you for your answer. I'm happy I can join you at Camp California in the U.S.A. I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only on July because I just started my new job and I got one month of my holiday, which are on July. You wrote to me that I can choice my accommodation. I would prefer stay in log cabins because I have a problem with my back it is a reason that I can't lie on the ground. Beside that I'm alergic,  that make me problem when I'm close to the nature. You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can choice. I'm quite good in paiting and I play tennis. I'll be very happy when you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some paiting's materials like oil paints canvas and bruches for me. The size of the canvas isn't so important. I have my own sports equipment to play tennis. I hope I'll have  possibility to improve my ability in it. I'm champion of my town, so I think I can find a right person who can play with me. Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather do you have in this time of the year. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite polish group ""THE CULT"" in Warshaw. I had the chance to help at the concert. You can't imagine how happy I was. I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot. You know I'm good in mace-up and I have done many times scenography. They were pleased that I can do two of this job that's why I got the work. I was working like crazy but I enjoyed  a lot. I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they made the concert. Could you imagine that they asked me to make the summer scenography. I heard, the atmosphere of their concerts is very hot but I didn't know they like to create this even by scenography. Could you believe that two nights I was cutting paper's flowers, grass, the sun and thousands of birds. I didn't have many people who was helping me that's why I was working 48 hours without stopping. I think the result of that action was marvelous. Everybody was very suprise that you can create such amazing things, using a sizors and papers. I like a lot the mountains which I made. From the distance they looked very real. I just rulled a paper and I painted a little white colours on the top. In front of the stage I put the grass and a lot of flowers. The light on the stage was very bright and very warm what's made the scenery very pleasent. After that I prepared the group. I done  mace-up for them. I was very happy because on this time I had a chance talking to them and to know more about them. They are very nice people even Audrey who seems very stupid. She is very intelligent. I really don't know why she behave herself so badly during her interview. I got their address so we can visit them one day. I told them about you and they said we are very welcome any time. I told them you are full of live and they are yours favourite polish group. They  like to know you a lot. We'll speak about it when I come to see you. I hope to see you soon. A lot of kisses. ",23.0
907," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing  you to give you the suitable information you need about me. but also I would like to thank you for the very nice prize. Here are some of the information: I would like to travel in July because then the school year ends and I will be able to go on vacation. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I can't sleep outside in a tent. I would be very pleased if I could practice basketball and swimming I am very good at basketball and I am playing in my school's team. I know how to swim and dive from high places. I am very keen on both sports. Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you, if possible, I would like to know what kind of clothes shall I take with me. And finally how much money will I need to have with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you again Yours Sincierly,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I'm writing to tell you about my experience last month. You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I've enjoyed it very much. I did many different kinds of things. First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place. Then I helped the dancers with their dance on stage. After that I helped the singers perform and dance together and finally I helped with the lights for the show. It was amazing! (the show) I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators I even met some very interesting people with who  made really good friends. What I liked the most was working with the singers, teaching them how to dance and follow some footsteps. This is an experience, I'll never forget. I'm looking forward to hearing from you very, very soon. Your friend ",29.0
152," Dear Sir/Madam. I'm writing to complain about the theatre show you did last week because there were too many irregularities during the show. Firstly, the guests stars who were supposed to play were different  and very disappointing because they stopped the show twice. Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late when it was supposed to start at 19:30 and anyone explained to us, the public, what was happening. To make matters worse when we bought the tickets, they were too much expensive and there weren't any discounts for young people or for groups. But the worst happened when the show finished, because we (my girlfriend and I) were hungry and the theatre restaurant was closed. Maybe, this was the worst show I have ever seen and for this  I'll wait for the refund. Your's Faithfully.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so we couldn't explain her what happened that night. Jon had crashed with Pat's boyfriend car and he told her that someone had kicked the car with a metal stick. Pat's boyfriend couldn't believe that story but Pat trusted in Jon and she thinked that he was honest. However, Jon felt very disappointed and he told the truth. At the beggining they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him. Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't explain her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend. It could be worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything to her. ",24.0
653," I feel very happy to be the winner of your competition. I would like to travel in July only because they will need me at work in August. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I have never done it and I think it is an experience not to be missed, a very original adventure! I would like to do singing and swimming. For the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very few experience in it. Concerning swimming, I practise this sport once a week on myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer! Otherwise, I would like to ask you which clothes I will have to take in my luggage. What is the weather like in July? Is it worth to take a raincoat? Should I take trainers? Finally, how much money must I bring with me? Is it necessary to ask for Travellers' Cheques? Or is it better to take only an international credit card?  [SEP]  Going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what  to do but it has also many disavantages. First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are on week-end. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want. Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had to find a  cloth for a precise day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it. However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what  to do. You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant to try  many  clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny! Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible. For instance, if you try  a cloth which fits you well, it can contribute to make you feel better.

346," Dear Mr. Smith, I am writting  you about an enjure that I had in your last musical  Circle Theatre. I went to see ""Over the rainbow"" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening. First of all, I was surpprising that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not played. Anybody told us why they wasn't there. I read on your advertisment in Friday's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the representation started at 20.15. I was waitting 45 minutes for anything! I am  studiant and I didn't find any discount's ticket. I don't understand the problem between your advertisment and the reality. And finally, after the show, I wanted to drink a coffee but the theatre restaurant was closed! Like mentioned in the newspaper I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Your sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? My life change everyday with the modern technology. For exemple, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I am going on  Internet and ask for what I need. The day after I get everything at home by post. In my point of vue,  Internet is the most important discover of the 2000 centery. You can book tickets for  theatre, sport, etc., you can find all  informations you need for yourself. You have a lot of things to do, to see, to learn. It is too big to tell everybody about what you can do! I use  all the time Internet for my homework and in the futur, I hope, I will be able to use it for my own work. Technology will not stop to grow up and help people in the futur. I hope I will help them, I am sure I will! ",25.0
914," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, Thank you for first prize. I was glad to win your competition. I look forward to coming soon. I would like to travel in July. Because it is the only free time I will have. I was very happy to hear that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. And I would prefer  tent to  log cabin. Because I have had experiance  to leve in  tent and I like it very much. Thank you for  chance to do two activities. I would like to choose Tennis and Photography. I play tennis since I was ten years of age. In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever plaed. Another activity what I have chosen is photography. I have just finished  profesional photographer course and I would like to continiew my education in this activity. I would like to ask some questions. First of all what kind of clothes  I have to take with me? Also, how much money  I have to take? Look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you for your letter. I was glad to hear from you. Like I said, I'd helped at a pop concert. I liked it very much. It was very interesting and enjoing. A pop concert had ten pop bands. Each of them must sang two songs. After all they chose  three best bands. While this concert I saw a lot of popular singers. For example: Maraya Kary, Tom Jone; Madonna. I saw the ""Boys on"". I knew you love them and I took two autographs for you and of course for myself. Afterwards ""Boys on"" won the first prize. I was shoked because I had alredy spoken with them and I had taken two autographs. Another part of my experiance at  pop concert when we will meet each other. Look forward to hearing from you soon.

52," Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to thank you for organising the International Arts Festival, in which I participated this year, and to give you my opinion about it. I think that organising this event was a great idea. I was very pleased when I read your advertisement for the festival. One reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events was also an excellent idea. It encouraged me to take part in the festival. Despite all this I would like to complain about some detailes. First of all stars were supposed to come from all around the world. Apparently there were artists from only six countries. All the concerts were great, but some concert halls were too small. There was a terrible lack of room and fresh air inside them. I would also like to suggest  you to try and make more plays and films available next year. I trust you will give this matter your great attention. I look forward to visiting  International Arts Festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mary, Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry for not having written earlier, but I've had an exhausting exam session at school. It was very interesting to hear about  rules in England. The rules in Poland are quite similar to those discribed in your letter. We are not allowed to talk during the lesson and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniforms, but there are schools, in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably lessen the amount of homework. It's hard to find any spare time sometimes! What about home rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home. All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them. Anyway, I must finish now. Has your dog already recovered? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Lots of love, ",35.00
367," Dear sir or madam, I have recently been on a holiday in London. During my stay I went to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed. First the advertisement said that there were discounts available but there were not. Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15. Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor . Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor. We saw the musical in sadness. Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner. To our surprise the restaurant was closed because  the lack of staff to keep it open. It was certainly not a perfect night out. I would be very pleased if I could have my money back. I hope to receive the payment as soon as possible. Yours faithfully FREDA SVENSSEN  [SEP]  Fashion of the future What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that. I gave it a thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind from plastic-fabrics. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes. I mean when the earth's getting warmer and warmer because of an pollution that we people cause  the world. Maybe in the future they'll find out a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine. Maybe everybody will end up wearing shorts and skirts. Strict suits will be transformed into a school-uniform-like shirt and knee-lengthed shorts. Anyway we defenately now that they're going to change. If we live long enough we'll be able to find out , so keep living! ",35.0
337," Dear Sir: I'm writting this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London. This show was supposed to be a perfect event but actually I had a very disappointing evening. First of all I want to say that I'm very keen on Danny Brook who was one of the main reasons why I decided to come. However my favourite actor was not there. How could that happen? I also would like to know why the musical show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven. I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start. I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me as long as I had been informed about it. Of course discounts were not available either, and the restaurant where we were supposed to eat afterwards was closed without any explanation at all. So, what should have been a nice evening out came to a nightmare. I guess all my reasons are more than enough to get my money back. Thank you very much: Yours faithfully:  [SEP]  Modern technology has actually changed my life quite a lot. Firstly I would like to talk about computers. A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them. Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they work. Now, I'm just fascinated by  Internet and I spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free. I'm impressed by communications as well. If I want to communicate with a friend in Australia I just have to send him an e-mail which is going to get to my fellow in a  while. Isn't that amazing? I should not forget mobile phones. If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him. Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great. Finally I want to explain that three weeks ago I started working for a new company and my job is all about new technologies. I'm extremly happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I'm learning a lot. So, as you can see, modern technology has had  influence in my life. ",37.0
507," 17/06/2000 Mr Smith, I write  you because last friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre. I went there because I had read a banner about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", but many informations were wrong. Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act. But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the show of 2.30 p.m., we couldn't enter in the theatre because the discounts weren't available. So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show! No only : we had the bad surprise that Brook had been substituded by another actor! I ask you if is it possible to have my money back, please, because I want to forgot that expense. Thank you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology can't not transforme our daily life. The inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and after  few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band, then I can go back home when I want, listening  the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car. So I have must more interestings things to do in my life. But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer. In everytime of the day I can communicate with people of all nationality of the world, I can have informations about everything, I can buy something which I can't find in the shops of my town, so I can do anything just  clicking on the mouse! Sadly, there is also a negative aspect. Sometimes,  computer substitudes real relationships between people. In fact, many boys pass several hours in front of their computer and the forgive that out of their houses there are their friends.... In conclusion, I think that modern technology get my life more interesting, but I prefer to stay with my friends and with my girlfriend then in front of a computer! ",22.0
1164," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing with reference to your last letter concerning the international student conference in our college. I would get you the information you are requested. First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as usually, we would organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wear a suit (for  man) or a skirt (for  woman). Furthermore, this party would be in your hotel like  the following years. Finally, there are a lot of mouseum is our town, therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum which is really fashinating. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  from: for: the group leader. subject: Arboriginal Art Museum. The aim of this report is intended to discribe the biggest building of our town. I am in a position to choose a good building which students like myself are interested in. a) this museum presents more than 200000 original art pictures. b) The building has been buit in 1999, therefore, it is a modern architecture. c) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tour in Paris. d) This building is included: 30 toilets, 500'000 lights, and also 100 people whom can help you if you need any information. I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the eldest civilisation of the world in one of the modernest building. ",26.00
741," Dear Miss Ryan. I am writing to inform  the further information about myself. I was very glad to hear that I won the competition. First of all, I can only travel in July. I have a summer holiday from at the end of June to at the begging of September as I am a student, but I am planing to work in August as a part-time job. So that's the reason why I can not travel in August. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins, because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents. It was great to have a fun and also it was very good memorise. As you said I will have the opportunity to do two activities. I am quite good at singing and I have a talent about singing that  I can entertain people by singing. In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn swimming but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be  good chance to improve my swimming. In fact, I have some questions that how much money I will need, what else I have to bring with  and if I have a emergency what you can do for. Once again, I am very happy to have such a good opportunity and I hope this letter can bring what you want to know about me. Thank you for your attention. Yours sincerely Lee. Han  [SEP]  These days, there are so many people  like shopping that it is one of the important part in our life. It is not, however, always enjoyable that there are both advantages and disadvantages. First of all, there are quite many advantages of shopping  are that it can be the solvation of our stress and boring. When you are under stress or when you are bored, if you go to shopping, then at least it can be  motive to change your mode. Also shopping makes people happier by using a lot of money and it influnce even  economic situation more flexably. There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time. When we are having a shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired. Also there are plenty of dangerous that lots of people have  wallet stollen because it is a public place and there are too many people. In addition shop owner often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly. The customer can never know what price is the normal  unless they have a same shop or  same thing. To sum up, shopping is  very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we can not find only advantages from it. ",22.0

We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes. When you go out of the Hotel turn right and go stright on, at the first crossroads turn right again. At the end of this street you can see our college on your left, it's a green building. At the end-of-conference party it'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, it'll be some picturs of our college, you'll see al the generations who passed  here. The wears aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans. Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do, but the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum. We all are looking forward to seeing your group. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TELEVISION What would our world be without television? It isn't easy giving an answer at this question. Television is an important invention, it permitted us to better our way of communication. This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world. Television has affected the ""all days life,,, too. We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs, all what we have to do is watching. And we like that, because it's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something. So television can be a positive or a negative invention, it depends on which use we want to do of this box. Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question. No, I don't think so. Television has become so important for us that we can't thinking that it couldn't exist. ",23.00
236," Dear Mr Manager of the Circle Theatre During my last holiday week in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement of the ""Over the rainbow"" show. I wanted to spend my leisure time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all in the advertisement  was written, as I had read that before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, the different actor stood in for in it. The time of the beginning of the show was written at half past two p.m. and at half past seven that evening, again. Lack of my time made me to go at the evening show. And unfortunately again, from some reasons it was postponed to quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement  was exactly written  some of the discounts of the tickets. No, alas in reality it appeared  a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough yet. At the end of the advertisement as I noticed it was said something of  perfect evening out. It wasn't truth. That's why I write my letter to you and I ask for my money back. I was expecting something really better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet at the court. Yours faitully  [SEP]  I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life. Looking back in the past, I can see, how big  difference  is between  life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so far as we could now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now, at present days. They could not communicate with someone living in other country, often located far away from his own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or  internet, we have a better access to a lot of different news. So, we are in  better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared  last years. For example a lot of pollution has raised. We now breathe worse air in our lungs, then our grand-parents breathed. I think, we are more addicted to do some things, which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watch TV or often using the mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe, that we are the part of wildlife. And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but determinly might destroy us. ",28.0

First of all, it had read on the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring at this show. But someone else participated instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing. The second problem was the start of the show. It began at 20:15 and not at 19:30! That's almost an hour later. I had read that there would be available some discounts, but I became none of them. The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out, but it was closed because of the hour the show finished. It wasn't a perfect evening at all. I hope you can understand my disappointment and   ask for my money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  In our days, nobody can live without technology. My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The timer of my radio wakes me up at half past six. I stand up, go  the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave. After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always reach late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to make compositions, to print some pictures or to surf on the internet. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends per  telephone. Without these technology I would get realy bored. Now, I loose less of time and can use the technology to enjoy myself. ",25.0

On the other hand I don't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it  cool. There is one thing I would like to ask you. It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend with food and this kind of thing. Yours Sincerely Adriano Tudela  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this  one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem. Sometimes, shopping can be really bore especially in important dates when the shop are absolutaly crowded and you can't see somethings as you wanted with carefull. ",20.0
867," Dear Helen. It is so nice to hear the news from you that I have won the first prize. I'm looking forward to getting sun-tanned under the sun in California. Here are the information which you asked me for. I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days. Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July. I'd prefer to say in log cabins. Because our family had some bad experiences with using tents. Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent. It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled. Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money for me. Thanks Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dearest Kim How are you? I wish you are fine. I'm fine either but I'm quite busy to find another part time job after the one, which was the concert supporting  one. I remember that you asked me to tell you about that job. It was fantastic but a bit hard! First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office. It was quite terrible when I had to let people leave, because all tickets were sold out. Then the concert started, I was called from one of the staffs for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next work I was gives was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore? It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested . But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even join that fantastic atmosphere. What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium. And that mad the concert absolutely perfect. I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together. Stay pretty and lovely! Kisses from  ",30.0
931," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I received your letter congratulating me on having won the first prize in your competition. I am extremely excited about the opportunity to go to your camp in the USA. Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel on July because of the exams I have on May. Apart from that I would not be able to travel there until the end of June. It does not matter to me whether I stay in  tent or  log cabin, but I would prefer  tent  to be much more in contact with  wild life and nature. The activities I'd like to do most are playing basketball and Climbing. The first one because I have been played basketball since the age of twelve and the second one because there are not many places where to go climbing in my city. Finally, I would  ask you if I have to take my own clothes with me or  you will provide me with some, and  the amount of money needed. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I received your letter last week in which you told me that you want to hear about my experience at the pop concert. It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security. People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it weren't a calm and quite public, we would have had troubles. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room were crowded. So that concert started an hour and a half latter. Everything was all right during the perform of the band, but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately leaving the public without the last part of the show. As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound -  both in wich I helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert. Althought all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the better experience I've ever had. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love, ",31.0
790," Dear Mrs. Ryan: I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize, a two week holiday at Camp California in  U.S.A, and that you need further information from me. Firstly, I would like to travel on July, because  is the only month I have holidays in. Secondly, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they're more comfortable than the tents, also because I don't like to sleep in tents very much, I think they're very cold during the night About the activities, I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it, and also because I know very well how to play. I used to be the captain of the selection of bascketball in my school, because I was the best to play, and I think I can still remember how to play. The second activity I chose was tennis, I am not so good, but I know how to play, I have played several times with my friends. To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like for example shampoo, soap, etc. so that I don't have to carry them in my luggage, I think they would just occupy extra space. Another thing I would like to ask you for, is money. I think it will be an expensive trip and I don't have enough money to pay for it. Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and souvenirs that I can buy in the Camp. I think that's all, and I look foreword to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely, Santiago Rico S  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjouable because of several factorors. One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, ""If I had more money, I would buy it"", or ""I wish I had more money."" Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers. The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable. ",29.0
746," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I was so suprise to hear from you. I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize on the competition. I'm so happy because it is the first time that I win something. Here it is all your information. I would like  if you could to have my vacation trip on July because  is the only time of the year that my job could let me have a vacation. As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it is my first time that I'm going to camping and I would like to see how the real life is. I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities also. I would like to choose swimming and the climbing. I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing that's why I choose it because I want to try something knew. At last I would like to ask you about my clothes and how the weather is going to be and what kind of clothes I must to take with me. That is all. Thank you for making my dream come true Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Everyone has likes and dislikes. But noone is doing what he likes all the time. There is times that you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times that you are doing what you like but not  the time you  like it. What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time. First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy to shop all the time. Nothing in life is always enjoyable  even the things we enjoy to do, and that's how life is. You say you enjoy shopping I understand but life goes on you can't do the same things every day. live your life and try to do different things and you will see that to do different things is exciting and more fun. You don't have to be bored with the same old things. Because as I said to do what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have  long time to do something the you enjoy it more. ",25.0
782," Dear Helen Ryan In response to your letter that I received last Saturday I am writting to answer your questions. I am very happy that I won this competition. I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday. My holidays will finish in the begining of September and  will be good to travel during this time. (August-September). The accommodation I would prefer to stay in   tents because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with the nature. For the time that I will spend there I would like to chose more the two activities but I know  is not possible so I chose swimming and singing. I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love  when I sing and about swimming I was champion last year in my city. So, I am quite good. I would like to ask you some questions like which kind of clothes  I have to go with ? Will I need to go with how much money? Is necessery tablets (for headach, insects)? Can I go with a friend? Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours sincerely  [SEP]  Introduction This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed in our daily life at school. Why to film the school? Firstly we should film our school to show how important it is for our growing. Secondly, parts of our life like breaks, lunch time, spending time with friends will be good to make the video interesting. Suggesting places to film. A good place to be filmed is our Geography class. The students in this class have lots of freedom to speak and we can travel around the world in one hour and fifteen minutes. Is wonderfull how the tecnology make things so easy. Also we should film our sports class because with this we will show how important  is to be healthy nowadays. Conclusion To conclude we could film our teachers life too. Will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if are not them we will never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidents and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.

227," 17.6.2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for explaining some problems your theatre has got and asking for some money back. I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students. But in a ticket office I realised I couldn't get it. Another problem was the time. The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed so at 20.15 a curtain of the stage was pulled up. As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem. I am a big fan of Danny Book and it was why I chose 'over the rainbow'. When I saw a different actor playing his role I was really disappointed. Las problem I would like to tell you  is  a restaraunt there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed because of decoration. When I booked the ticket I really expected the show. Unlike my expectation it was so disappointing and annoying. So I would like to ask for some money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, TA HYUN PHAT  [SEP]  I remember some sientific cartoons when I was younger I watched on television. They describe the future world where people would travel to the moon. But it is coming true now. Modern technology has been changing even my daily life in positive and negative ways at the same time. First it helps  my social life to be convinient. I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second I can save time. If there was no public transport like  underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time. On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres or telephones I could have less chances to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit. To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convinient. In spite of its good sides I think my life could get worse. To live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health. But I am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and I feel I am getting weaker. I suppose people including me should keep themselves in a limited their own space in near future. It will be caused by technology. ",32.0
3," Dec. 16th, 2000 Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to mention my opinions on the International Arts Festival that you have organised this year. It was a great idea, but I think I need to make some points about the things that I found unsatisfactory. First of all, I was disappointed that the artists invited were from only six countries. Next year's festival will be much better if artists from places other than Europe and the USA take part in it. Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition. They were cold and moist, too, because the air-conditioning system was insufficient. Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year. However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all  events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided. Finally, I should say that I had a very good time in spite of the flaws and I would like to thank you for it. I wish to enjoy an even better festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dec 16th, 2000 Dear Mary, I'm glad to have received your letter and I'd really like to talk about the school and family rules here. Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys. But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing to the teacher using the second plural person (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class. As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected. Another thing  different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods. We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period. Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m. I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still ones coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see. Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules. Take care!

762," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. On the following there is some further information from me. I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June. I do not think I have enough time to prepare somethings to travel before of July. In fact, I really do not mind to stay in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before. I think its might be fun to try to stay in the tent this time. I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming. I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen. I won first prize two years ago. The other activity is swimming. I started to learnt when I was five years old. I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club. Now I own a swimming school and have trained the staffs every week. I think both activities I have chosen are suitable for me and I am sure I can do well. What type of clothes I should bring with me? and is there any equipment I need to bring with me. I would like to know how much money I need to spend during a camping. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely (Mali Ratana)  [SEP]  13th July 2000 Dear Kim Thank you very much for your letter that I just got last week. How are you? I hope you have a nice summer time now. I wondered who had told you about I had helped  a pop concert last month. Anyway, it is doesn't matter now who had told you, but I was very happy and enjoyed it. Well, I am going to tell you about it. First of all, I had to been train by the concert's staff for a day. Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared a stage,  like put the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do some make up. I was very frightening I might put too much make up on their faces, but everything was allright. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for  staffs or the singers. After the concert finished I had to help them cleaned up everything. I was so tired, but enjoyed. I really like to help people without  something back. This experience I was so prond  and very enjoyed. I think I didn't waste my time at all. I spent my free time to helping them  its made my life a little bit busy. I think I have learnt a lot from this experience. To helping people you should not expect anything back to you, except happiness and enjoyable. Well, I think I must stop writing now. I hope you are enjoying with my experience. I hope to see you sometime next month. Love ",26.0
677," Dear, Helen Ryan Thank you very much for the prize at camp California in America. For the time that I would like to travel  must be on July only. This is because my A-levels exams is coming up so I really need times to revise, and July is the only month and time that I am free. An accommodation, I  prefer to stay in a tent. This is because it is my first time to see an outside world by myself so I need to gather up new experiences. I have never ever stayed in a tent before but some of the people I know said that it is fun and much more exiting. As I am a person who is love and doing activities, so I would like to choose to do sailing and photography. Once I used to take a photography course at my school and my teacher taught me well about taking photo. Also I tried how to sail before, but I am not perfectly good at it, but I  love to sail more. Finally, I would like to ask about what kind of clothes do I need to bring? and the money, do I need much of them? Please, give me a suggestion about these . Your faithfully  [SEP]  Dear, Kim How are you? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I ever have. Last week I offered myself to help the others at the concert and it was amazing. I couldn't believed how close I was to the band. There were so many youngsters at the concert, but because I was the youngest in a helping team so I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment. A concert did very well and I enjoyed it so much. Later on the band took a break for ten or fifteen minutes, so I served them with glasses of fizzy drink and chocolate bars, biscuits and sandwiches. You will not believe how close I was to the singers. After a break, the bank have to carried on  the concert for another one hour and a half. People at the backstage including me were helping to clean up all the stuff and  ready for the end of the concert. The time has come, when the band finished the concert, we have to served them drinks again and helped to clear up the stage. Afterwards, I have a chance to took photos with them and have their autographs etc. It was the enjoyable time in my life and  wished that you were there with me. From this letter, I am sure that you should be able to share this experience with me. Lots of Love ",32.0
1197," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received yesterday. Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations, which might be useful for the students. First of all, the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel, which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities. This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall. You will be able to get there either by bus (no 150) or on foot. Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference. It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last the whole night. People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi-coloured clothes. Finally I think that you should jump at  opportunity to go to the historical Pergam's Museum before leaving. Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there. I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth. Your sincerely  [SEP]  To: (group leader) From: Subject: Bournemouth National Museum As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum, which is, to my mind, one of the most interesting buildings of the area. Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need. 1. Architecture The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit 'heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world. 2. Exposition Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum. 3. Restaurant The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum. To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant  to have a rest if you need to.

235," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW. I saw the show on  17th of July. Firstly, the advertisement claimed  discount ticket was available. Although I have a student card for discounts I could not get any discount. So I had to buy a normal ticket. Secondly, I bought a second musical show ticket which start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. As a result, I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00. Thirdly, your advertisement misled I could see Danny Brook in the show who I adore. When I turned up  the show, there was another actor instead of him. Fourthly, after the show the theatre restaurant was closed because of it's problems. But I could go evening out. To sum up, I believe your advertisement completely misled . So I am fully entitled to ask for  refund except for evening out. I hope this matter will recieve your prompt attention. yours faithfully BO-PHAT SUN (MS)  [SEP]  Nowadays, mordern technology has increasingly been developing. We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily, on the other hands, we get also many disadvantages which could harm us. In my opinion, the main advantage is  developing of medical technology. For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting  leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body. Another advantage is sharing information. The more developing the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is. So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different country. In contrast, the technology can cause a pollution. By developing of transport, we can get wherever you want to go easily, however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog. Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security carmera which has been combined with mordern technology. In conculsion, I conciderly said we has been charged by morder technology in two way. One is  advantage and the other is  disadvantage. And it will change our lives, also in the future. ",23.0
839," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter and congratulations! I have always been interested in visiting other contries. In fact it didn't want to ask my parents for money, and going on holiday with you would be an ideal solution. I will be having my exams durind this month, so I can't travel before July. Also I'm going to meet a director of Smith'th Travel Agency for  interview concerning possible work with English-speaking tourists. As you can see, I will be available only in July. As regards accommodation, I would like to stay in tents, because I used to going on holiday with my friends and staying in tents. It is just wonderful. In my spare time I like to play basketball for a local team of which I have recently been made captain. I would now like to learn how to play tennis and golf, if it is possible. Could you please let me know what kind of weather will be there in July, what sorts of clothing I'd better take with me. Is there an extra charge for some trips, which might put them beyond my means. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Raisa Sharapova  [SEP]  To: Dinara Safina From: Raisa Re: Daily life at our school. As requested, it has collected some information about the school. Below is a summary of the most important relevent points with some recommendations. 1. The fully-equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are no enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increase the number of them, because it will be more exiting to film. 2. The school arranges an amasing range of activities, such as excuintions, sports and different kinds of trips. Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the most funny events happen while we are playing basketball and football. I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video. Conclusion. Our school is an ideal place for making a short video. There are many interesting lessons and other activities. I do recommend, however, to make a short video about a) lessons in the computer centre b) basketball and football games. ",34.0

Finally, a girl very friendly came with us. We bought some trousers, tee-shirts, and one pair of shoes. My friends bought some things like a red trousers and white tee-shirts.

I would like to travel in July because  is the best period to take a break from my work. For the accomodation, if is possible I would like to stay in  camping because I think  is a relaxing place where to stay. Further because I like to live in contact with the nature. Also  is possible to meet a lot of people, and chatting during the night, might around the fire, playing a clutone and singing I think  is a nice way to have fun. I'm really happy to know that  is possible to play sports. I would like to play Tennis, and  swimming. I choose tennis because  is a sport that you can play with others people, also because I like the competition in the sport. The other sport that I would like to do is swimming. Swimming is my favourite sport because you can relax your body and your mind. I would like to ask you for further informations about this travel. First of all which kind of clothes  I have to bring with me? How much money  I need to do this travel? Also, if is possible I want to know if there is the possibility  to organise a trip around the most important cities near the camp? And if during the nights there are  entrotenements? Thanks for all these informations, I'm looking forward to hearing  you again. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  After the discussion that we had in the english class, I understood that a lot of people sometimes don't enjoy during the shopping. I can't understand these people because this situation never happen to me. By the way usually the people that don't like shopping are men or children. I think  is difficult to find a woman that doesn't like shopping. But I have to admit that sometimes I don't really like shopping above all when I'm tired or when I'm not in the right mood. In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become nervous because I can't find anything. For me, the best moments for the shopping are two opposite situations. For the first situation happen to me, when I'm hungry with somebody really close to me like my boyfriend or a component of my family, so for relaxing my mind I go to shopping and usually I enjoy  a lot. The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something for me as a preseant for myself. ",27.0
