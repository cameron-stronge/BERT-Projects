482," June 17, 2000 Dear Manager, As for the ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems. Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned on the advertisement for this musical show as ""Danny Brook"". As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny's stage, I was very disappointed. I think you should have informed us of  changing  starring before starting of the show. In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was changed. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30  mentioned on the advertisement. As the third point, our tickets were not discounted at all! The Ad. says that TICKETS: Discounts Available. Lastly, your theatre restaurant had been closed already when the show was finished, because the time of begining of the show was late. As above mentioned, it can not be a ""perfect evening"". There are lots of reasons why I was so disappointed, and could not enjoy the show, you see!! Therefore,  would be grateful if you could give me back some money.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told about our plan, indeed our ""secret plan"", to Sally! How foolish! But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday-party for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been ""surprising"". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents already died when she was in the high-school. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children. In spite of such difficulties, she always shows a pretty charming smile to us. On June 2, because of Pat's fault, Sally already knew our plan. We were enjoying  at  home celebrating her birthday. Suddenly, the door was opened. ""Good Evening!"" ""Oh! You came back for me! Nigel"" Sally cried with pleasure. Nigel himself was a big ""surprising"" present for Sally. I never forget her happy face ..... We spent a brilliant night. ",25.0
234," Dear sir, I'm sorry to tell you, that I'm really disappointed of your advertisment for the musical show in the Circle Theatre. First of all, I was really looking forward to see one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, what disappointed me very much. Also, the show didn't start in time, it started half an hour later. And you have written in your advert, that there would be discounts available, what wasn't possible this evening. After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of  painting-works inside the restaurant. Finally we had no  perfect evening at all! And  of these circumstands, I would like to have a part of my money back. I hope you understand my concern. Yours Faithully, Brigitte Beschle  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because he likes to tease people. So, it was last summer, we were on a short trip with our class to a adventure-park. We had a lot of fun. Until we came to a big cave, where you could walk through. It was quiet scary for me, but I said to myself, come on you can do it. I walked  first with Pat and two of my friends. But suddenly, there were only Pat and I left. We lost the others. So I tried to get not in  panic, but  no chance. I was so worried  not to find the way out, that I started to scream and cry. First, Pat started to laugh, but as he realized, that I didn't stop crying, he comfort me until I was calming down. And after a while we found the way out. I ask him, not to tell anybody that I cried. He said, 'shure no problem'. But next day, back in the classroom, some of the students looked at me and started to laugh. After that  was all clear, Pat and secrets. ",27.0
255," Mr. Maneger, In this unconfortable situation I am writting to tell you about some irratable problems. I went today to see Over the Rainbow, and I am very disappointed with the organisation of your theatre. First of all, when I went to buy my tickets I discovered that the advertisement was saying false things because there wasn't any discount available, but in anyway I bought the ticket. Then, the time marked to the beginning  was 19:30 and unfortunatly he began at 20:15. I have already, saw others versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, who ended with the musical. Closing this facts, when the musical finished I was very , in the fact of the wainting for the start of the musical and  dissapointed with this version of Over the Rainbow, every body went to the restaurant wich is closed without any explanation. I am very dissapointed with this evening and with the desorganized way of deal with problems so I am asking  my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He has a bestfriend, that was more like a brother for him. They always done thing together, and they were the most popular boys in school, both were very hanson, played football they were the example for everybody. Before one day, when Pat discovered that his brother was gay, after this their relationship has change. Pat was very frightened with this situation. Pat and Ted, had always competition, and Ted used to be the best, he never had failed and people in general constums to like more Ted, I don't now why. This secret was an opportunity for Pat be the best without  competition but it is a secret who involved his best friend sexuality, and if Ted was a normal person it will be fine but he was the example for all  school. Unable to keep a secret he told for everyone, ended his friendship with Ted, now Ted is rejective for everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honestity. I  prefer be nothing than bun like Pat ",20.0
819," Dear Helen Ryan, First at all, I'd like to thanks  for the prize  Won. I'd like to know  USA. this prize came in a good time. I'd like to travell in july because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For it the only one that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabins because I can't bear sleeping in a tent, I hate this kind of accomodation. But I love sports. I'd like to play Tennis and  swimming these are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better  I can swim, because since I was I child I've been practising it. I've already Won three prizes about it. And I'd like to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too. I've never gone to  USA before. I hope I will have a good journey. Yours Sincerely, ALBiTO.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. We had a class discussion about shopping, for it I'm writing to tell about my opinion. I love shopping mainly when I am alone on when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax. When I  got plenty of money sometimes I like spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girl friend. But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and  sad  is not a good idea to go to shopping. Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like more and shoes I love new shoes. One good idea  to go to shopping is when you  got plenty of money. ALBiTO ",28.0
785," Dear Mrs. Ryan: Thank you very much for your letter. I am so glad to know I won the first prize. Regarding your questions, the following are my answers. The only time available for me to travel is July, any time during the month suits me. I need to insist in it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year. I will love to be in a log cabin. They are more comfortable and really match with the enveiroment. It is not easy to chose from the list of activities, all of them look interesting. Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and Photographe. The first one sounds like a great adventure, while the second will allow me to capture all the unforgettable views. In addition, I would appreciate  if you let me know what is the kind of clothing required for the Camp; if I need some money there and for what; and finally if the prize is just for me or if I can go with somebody else. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Finally I'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life. Can you believe that I was helping in the last Britney Spears's Concert? During the day I helped preparing her room, then she arrived, and I was there to continue helping. She was so kind with all of us, of course I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon, I can't wait to show it . The concert was a big success,  lot of excitment. Everybody sang and danced, and I was there to see everything from the best position. Each time, when she comes back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her weight. Then she eat something small and she looks full of energy all night long. At the end, she took the time to say good by to all of the people helping her. I really think she's the best. But now, tell me about you. Don't be lazy and write more often. ",29.0
185," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the arrangements for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was spending some days in London and enjoyed a lot the idea of seeing this show. All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway. We got really upset when we realized he was being substituted. The show was scheduled for 19:30 but it only started at 20:15. Besides the boredom of having waited for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished. As it was not our perfect evening out, as you suggested in your advertisement, we would like to know if it would be possible for us to get a refund. I look forward to your response. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Ted, I'm writing to tell you about a great book I've just finished reading, and which I'm sure you would like to read too. Its name is ""Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"", and I really got impressioned with the coherence of the stories. Agatha Christie presents situations that make us break up our minds. The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we brainstorm a lot trying to find out who is the criminal. I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place in a Detective course. I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study. Agatha Christies stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent. It's estimulating to read them. One of the stories will be read on the radio next week. I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there  many challenges for your new carreer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

342," Dear Sir or Madam, I write you this letter to complain about your musical show. First of all, the show began three quarters of an hour late: it started at quarter past eight instead of half past seven, what of course was very bothering. I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appeared. He had been replaced by a really bad actor,  whom I don't even know the name. I was very disappoint of that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actor. There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets, what appeared to be wrong to. I had to pay the full prize for them, which was quite expencive. My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play. It turned  to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even received an explaination therefor. I had a really bad evening and would like to ask you for my money back. Waiting for your reply Yours faithfully Pierre Gaussier  [SEP]  In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First off all, if computers haden't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of it! I use my computer for many things, such as homeworks, games, digital video or  Internet. The developpement of portable communication systems, such as mobile phones has greatly changed our way of life. It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and everywhen, even if we are two thousand kilometers away from each other. Precision industry has changed my life a lot too. I practicate Scuba Diving during the week-ends and hollydays. That wouldn't have been possible a century ago, because all our material, such as dive computers, tanks or regulators didn't existed at that time. I think that we live easier now (thanks to modern medicine) and that our lives will get easier with the time. ",26.0
877," Dear Miss Ryan, I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much about that. Here is the information you want, I hope they are useful. First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June. And in August, I have to go back to school to do some classes work and I have got a camp to organise. So I would like to travel on July. Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation  in tents. Since I haven't been camping in tents so I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what will it be. About the activities, I chose swimming and climbing. I am in  swimming term a school and I won a prize last month. Although I'm not good at climbing, I want to experienced  myself. I would like to ask what is the weather in  USA like and what kind of clothes should I wear? And I was wondering how much money do I have to take? Also, if I can join climbing, what do I have to bring? At last thank you very much for answering my questions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It was lovely to hear that you want to hear about my experience. I helped  the concert which was my favour singer's concert. I helped with the piano part in that concert. At the concert, I had to play 4 songs and I had never played in a concert before, so I felt very nervous before the concert. But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to claim down and play well in front of the audience  the concert. And also I have never played the piano with the singers before, and after that it makes me more confident and improved my skills a lot. When the concert finished my favour singer talked to me & they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed will in that concert. They taught me a lot about playing piano as well. At last thank you for sharing my experience. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes Yours sincerely, ",27.0
401," Dear Sir. I'm sorry to say it but your musical show was very disappointing to me. I was very disappointed. Lot of things that you have written at the advertisement are not true. You writer that the actor was going to be Danny Brook but he wasn't there. A different actor was played and this was very disappointing to everyone. Also the show did not start at half past seven o'clock as it was said but at eight and fifteen o'clock. Everyone get bored  until the show start. About the discount that we are going to have. Why it does not make to us? I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. as it was closed. Everyone after the show run to take a good seat at the restaurant but everyone  disappointed when they see the sight which said ""Close for today"". That evening wasn't my perfect and I have to say that I want my money back because the show was a disaster. I'm really sorry I am saying this but  is the true. I am hoping that you will not make such mistakes again. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is a friend of mine and we are friends for almost a year. She is a very good girl and she can deal with every promblem she has. It was Saturday when I called her and told her to go for a walk at the park, which was not very far away from our houses. I had never told her a secret before but this time, I was going to tell her. The secret was about our friend Maria who was very kind with everyone I told her that I have heard that Maria had concern. Pat told me that she would not told that to anyone but the other day I learnt that all the school had known about Maria. I was sure that  was Pat who told it to everyone. After that I had an argument with Pat and then she told me that she said it only to one person. I was very sad with what Pat do and I didn't speak to her for a long time. But now we are friends again but I will never say to her a secret  in my whole life. ",24.0
1084," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising  good programme,  especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days. I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give  the information of 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go  and to huggest our opinion. We have seen an advertisement of last Saturday 'The Times' edition of the show. It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall, London or Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. Firstly, it will introduce  latest fashions connecting Millenium. Secondly, we will be able to see leisure and sports wear about fashion trend of next year. It would be  fantastic opportunity to the students who study a fashion. Finally, we can see how to  make up and make better hairstyle in the show. Most of all, It is free for students to enter. We would like to know if it is possible to change your programme. We would be grateful if we could go there in the afternoon on 14 March because we are able to go shopping. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Whenever I recollet it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go to  Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going to  Army, I was able to apply to  Korea Auxiliary Police. One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul. Suddenly, the theft signal came into. So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly. When we arrived at the place which it happened, one man started running away. Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow. Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg. He fell down and we had to stare at each other. After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him. As a result, I could go on vacation. When I said to my mother, she asked me not to do it again. But, I was a police-man. Therefore, I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous. ",23.00
606," Dear Mr Helen Ryan, I am writing to you and reply the answers from your letter. I was glad to hearing the news from you and thank you very much! When you mentioned the period of my travelling I'm afraid I  only free in July. Because I go on holiday in July naturally, and I have two terms in June and August. Therefore, I hope that you could make  suitable arguement between you and me. Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins which I could feel  more American style of the accommodation. In addition, there should not  too hot inside during July. If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city. I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never give it up. Esepically, it is really good for my healthy during the growth period. Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time. I can remember that I used to take photographs on the exhibitions or during the holidays. It must be nice for my memories when I am older. In addition, it could showed people how nice the places  are and the views I have got. Therefore, I would like to do those two activities. Finally, I would like to know  the weather in California. Do I need take too much clothes? Could you tell me that the amount of money I can bring during the holiday? I look forward to hearing from you! Your sincerely SHE DUNES  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailors are opening to customer. Therefore, people used to shopping weekly or monthly. In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping. It seems a human activity during their spare time. However, we are going to change  traditional system to the ""e-shopping"". It is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it looks like a service and  also boring for  customer. I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping. I believed that most of busy people want go shopping by the easy and quick way. Because they don't like waiting for payment and waste time of life. Therefore, they would like to use ""e-shopping"" which is getting better for their time. The life style has change already from  past. Shopping is  common activity in their life. We must focus on the specific life style, which will make us enjoyable.  In conclusion, I believe that shopping only waste time for human life. And you couldn't get back any more. ",20.0
480," Dear Sir, I am from Brazil and I recently expent a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement of a musical show being held at The Circle Theatre. As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the play. As I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not avaible. Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good. So I sitted in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, that is an unacceptable delay. Even though I was still excited about the show, but then I sudently realise that Danny Brook is not performing, he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor. The night had been terrible, but it could be saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it been closed because the heater was not working due to  leaking. As you can see it was not the perfect evening out your advertisement talked about. Then, I would be glad if you could have  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily lief. Modern technology has brought  many discoveries which have made our daily lives much easier. For example,  internet has given us the possibility of acessing reliable information very fast. I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what happens to me. When I was younger I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine. But technology is not just about studying, it is entertainment too! I can watch pay-per-view films without having to go out to rent one. I can also listen to cds, play the latest games, watching concerts.. everything in a zap. You also have fast food, or food made in the microwave within a few minutes. As you can see, technology is about saving our time, so we may have more time to do what we like. In my opinion, technology is making my life much better because of that. ",32.0

According to Camp California in the U.S.A. I expect to traveling on July because I will have a long holiday break on that time and my children have to go to France with student's school on July as well. I think, it will be  very good time to traveling by without worries. How is about an accommodation. I prefer to live in tents because I feel very natural. Can you imagine how exsiting  when we stay in the dark and very quite and we can hear a sound of  animal. How's amazing that? When I arrived there, I would  to  painting and take a photography  because both of its was my hobby. I have been doing a lot of them when I have got a free time and when I feel empressted  where I have been. I think I can do it very well. Fainally I would like to ask you about I have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how is the weather over there on July because I will prepare the clothes as usedful. By the way I have to say thank you very much for everything that you was offer me and I look forward  the further information from you. your sincerely ZITA ZALAI  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? It was  very long time as I didn't write the letter to you. I hope, you will feel better when you finished my letter. Today I  going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert as I went from last month, it has got a lot of thing to talk about. Firstly it is about the hall which they used for  concert. It is  very big hall including the sound system and the light at the steat. It was brillian. Secondly it is the super star as they came to show at  concert. They are very cool. By the way I had done many thing in that concert. I had to connect with people who  responsible about  ticket. They had to check when people came in the hall and I was the one who checking the tickets as well. You know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't weait to go at  frount and they are try to go over very quickly. So you have to explaining too many time to make people clamed down and standed in the row. It was very hard for me and I won't do it again.

667," Dear the competition organiser (Helen Ryan) I'm as happy to heard that I have won the first prize. Here is the information you want from me.  Firstly, I can only go in July. Because I'm in the holiday  that moment. I think I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California is in tents. Because it is more safety, and I don't like to be in the log cabins. The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of chose which is I like. But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well. Photography is a very interesting activitie, and is not too hard to do too. Here  have some questions which I would like to ask, what kind of clothes sould I need? How much did I need for the Camp? Finally I hope the information I've gave are useful for you, and hope you can answers my questions A.S.A.P. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable  Shopping, for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a method to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still have something you will not enjoy it. It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping. For example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life, they won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping  also very important. For example in HK all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping. Because have too many people it make you want to stay home  won't enjoy shopping. After I've written this composition, I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time, but still have sometimes you won't. ",24.0

141," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" performed at ""The Circle Theatre"" on the 20th of May. To begin with, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but, due to a ""technical problem"", as they said, it started at 20:15. However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show on the proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the first actor was not Danny Brook as we expected but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas. What is more, there were no discounts available for the ticket fees nor we had the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons. I am not satisfied with the service we received, I am therefore writing for a full refund and I expect to receive by post a cheque for £20. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  LIKE BLIND SHEEP In the 21st century, people will all the wearing the same clothes, the same shoes, they will be buying the same accessories. We'll get out in the morning and find out that our neighbour wears our same jacket and he's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours. The thing is we are too fashion conscious, too fussy about our appearance and we'll end up forking out for smart clothes only because the people next door are doing so!! The reason why we'll do this is that we need to be accepted by the elite group that decide who you must be and how you must behave. They make you think there's noting left to do but to surrender and do what you've been told to, like blind sheep. Anyway, I don't really mind what people will be wearing in 100 years' time. As for me the only thing I care for in the morning is that I don't have my socks mismatched! ",29.0

As far as accommodation is concern, I would like to say that I prefer to stay in tents. I like staying in tents because when we go on holiday with my friends, we always stay in tents, so I am used to staying in tents. Moreover, I have also been asked to choose some activities. I would like to choose basketball and swimming. When I was at school, I have been playing for the school team and I am good at swimming.

There are special methods and materials for students. Afternoon Lessons: The aim of the afternoon lessons is to be able to give ability in speaking. There are some discussion groups, so students may have  discussion on any subject. Break Time: We have a lot of facilities for break time. These are computer, video, and sports.

I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw  its advertisement yesterday. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It starts at 10.00 am and finishes  19.00 pm. The date of the show is on Tuesday  14th of March. It is  really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London. We would like to go there because it is very popular nowadays. I've heard that  Leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are really wonderful. It is also free for students. We all know that you organised everything. However, we can change the programme. Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you know. We have  free timer on Wednesday  15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do  shopping quickly after sightseeing of London. I would be very pleased if you let us to go to the show. I also would like to say thank you for organising the good program for us. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A DAY OF MY LIFE It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again. I was afraid of doing it but I had to do it. It was the first time I had robbed a bank. I was her best friend. I promised her  to find a money for her operation. She was at the hospital and she was really bad. That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived  the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked  cashier to give me all  money. Before I took  money one of the cashier had pressed a button to call a police. I quickly left  bank. However, it didn't take long that they caught me soon. The policeman arrested me and I stayed in a prison for 15 years. The worst thing was my friend died after 10 days I was arrested. ",25.00
109," 17, June 2000 The manager The Circle Theatre Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw another actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that  will be discounts for it, but, they didn't make us discounts! With all this problems, the only thing that led us, was  to eat something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people didn't arrived to work that day. So it was the most badly evening that I had ever spend. I asked you to consider all my reasons and turned back my money, I think  is the only thing you can do. Thank you for your comprehension  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was saturday night, and I was, with my sister Pat alone in my home. That night I was invited to a great party, but I was punished, and I had to stayed at home with my sister. My parents were out for the weekend. When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape home without telling my sister, unfortunately when I arrived she was waiting  me in my room. When I enter my room she was very happy, because my father will punished me again, of course, she will tell him, but I decided to pay her if she beheaved quietly, she accepted and I payed her a lot of money. At sunday night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on saturday, my sister beheave silence for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, know that I had go out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.

I like to sleep in a tent under the free sky since I have done the military-service therfore I would prefer a tent as my accomodation. My favourite activity are swimming and singing. It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overwight. I like to singing a song when I am alone. Singing is good for my emotion.

I need material for drinking and eating, that is the basic fact that  I must go shopping for food. It is not enjoyable to see that the prize for food are going more and more higher. My salary are going lower than lower. When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of goods whitout take care on my money. Despite I have enough money shopping is not always enjoyable too, because I don't know which goods I will buy in the future. Also I will buy goods which I don't need. There are many goods which quality is bad  in this way the environment pollution will be more and more increase. This is the fact that shopping is not enjoyable. ",22.0
201," Dear Sir or Madam. A few days ago I went to your theatre to see a musical show. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it, I was expected  opposit. First of all the advertisement where you have advertised your program and what the theatre was providing for you is totaly wrong. A came to look at my favorit actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but  whom I saw were another people. Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy a tickets and when I apeared infrant of  casses I found out that the cost of  tickets on your advertisement and  real price wasn't the same,  real price was much higher. Also  show started very late compere to what was writen on the advertisement. And I think you know how it is just sit and wait for 45min. befor the beggining? So, after all of that, I wanted to have a nice relaxing diner in your restaurant, I was very angry when I apeared infrant of closed doors and there was a notice, that the restaurant wasn't working. In fact  writing to you just with one main reason. I'll be really delightful to resive back the money for my ticket. I'm looking forword  hearing from you. Faithfuly yours Lena Jarova  [SEP]  Begin at the begining. Look at  historical books  400-600 years ago, or even in  time of  First and Second World War,  how are sociaty changed, just because we did step up in the  science and technology. In one hand scientist discovered a lot of medisent from different illneses, but in an enother hand they discovered many illneses about which we haven't herd before. I think this side of the question is balanced because before  effect on our health was less than it is now. More and more people died from some illness wheres  long time ago less people died from  illneses, dispite that fact that they had less medisent. However technology nowerdays impoved so much and it changed our life a lot. Today we can't even think how we could possibly leave without computers or without airplanes. Computer it is our way of with  outside world comunicat, wheres with airplanes we can rich our parents, friends easily and much faster, then if we would  use bouts or trains. Everyday scientist and technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and it is good, it has to be like that, we have to do forword not behind from the point where we are now. Society has to go forword not to stop on one place. ",20.0
1172," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writting  you to reply your question about the conference in London. thank you for your letter. I am very pleasant to know you decided to come to the ""II International conference of Human Rights"" which will be celebrated in Albert Hall college  next 25 of June. I would like to inform you that the group you belong to, has been booked in  Palace Hotel, in the center of London from the 24  June until  25 of June. The Albert Hall College, the building where will be taken part the conference is sited near Green Park Avenue; so, to get  it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station. It takes about 10 minutes. Therefore, that's the faster way of transport you can choose. The Conference will start at 9 am of 25 June and will finish about 6 pm in the same day. During the day  is supposed having a break of half and hour at 12 p.m and finally,  a party for all the people who will be there. That will be a smart party and because of this, it will be required a well-dressed and immaculate presence. Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit. As I can see from your letter, you will have about three hours before you catch your plane, so, I would suggest  to visit The Tate Modern Museum, where you will can find several interesting pictures such as Dali's  Warhols. If you need some more information or details about he conference, you can contact Alexia on 0033*** phone. I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit. Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings, for this reason I would suggest them to visit 1) ""Fontana di Trevi"" sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome. That's a small square where there is a fountain very big. It was built by  Canovas architect in 1638. That is the fountain  which  ""Dolce Vita"" film was taken place. 2) For other hand, there is  Villa Borghese Building, That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and, Bernini, who stayed for a long time working in Rome. CONCLUSION I would recommend  them the buildings because: 1) First of all, there are sited in the center of Rome so, they can take a bus to get  them move and around the city. 2) Secondly, they can enjoy visiting museums, and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the ""pizzerias' and restaurants near these famous places. In conclusion, they could combine art, the history and the night  visiting one only place  without spend much money. ",28.00
553," Dear Mrs Ryan: Thank's for accept me in the competition. I hear that the competition there are very good, and the Camp California is very famous for his competitions. I would like to travel on July because before  it's impossible for me and in July it's my birthday and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full. Another thing is my accommodation I prefer to have log cabins because it's easyeast for me. I will choose for  activities tennis and swimming, I'm good on tennis because I play since 1990 and I loved it and  swimming because I like to swim and I've been  two competition and I won both. I would like to ask you for money and clothes because my parents are travelling and it is impossible for me to have  money because my sister doesn't want me to go because I'm only 14, but when I get there I promise to return  you all the money because I don't have  cash at this moment. Thanks for all, and I will be there the next month. Your sincerely Lola Villanueva.  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable."" For me went to shop it's not the best thing I can do. Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping  they don't realised that they are outside in the real world  poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things, you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. At the rest of you who don't understand this it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need. And sometimes I get bored when I'm shopping because now I don't really enjoy it. Bye and think on this. Your Friend Lola Villanueva J. ",21.0
147," Sir manager, I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper. I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had, I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there, but when you said that  show was the best I decided to go. When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said. I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality, but that was not all. When the show started the person who was acting  it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor. Really he was bad. Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed. So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had. I am letting down because of your behaviour. You wanted to cheat me, so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back. I am looking forward  your answer. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world. First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too. Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - are making different things. For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone. I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes. A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before  reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven. In my case I dislike computers. I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier. On the other hand what will happen with us in the future? Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs. So, what are we going to do? Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution, so we have to be careful. ",29.0
870," Dear Ms. Ryan, Even if I worked hard on it, I was very surprised of winning just the first prize. At the moment, I'm worried of about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently achieved a new job and I started working just three months ago. For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to chose the period for my holidays. Consequently I hope that  is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work with suspends its activities. As far as I am concerned, I would prefer an accomodation in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tend as well. As you already know, I am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently I would choose photograpy as the first activities and painting as the second. However I would like to know if by any chance the photograpy activities are only for beginners. In this case I would rather do some climbing, which I have never done before. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  - Shopping is not always enjoyable -. In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actualy most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion in which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant situation. In fact, the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need it, shopping can be a very nice activity. Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all what I can using ""on-line"" services. God bless the one who invented the Internet! ",31.0
1010," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to thank you for the good programme, especially on Wednesday, because the other student and I like Art Galleries. But, the last Friday, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show. Now, we want to know if it is possible to go to watch this Show. It is on Tuesday 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall between 10.00 and 19.00. We think that it is a great opportunity because it is just one time per year and it is free for stundents. We suggest you to change the programme. We think that Monday and Wednesday are good, but we ask you to change the programme on Tuesday. If it is possible, we want to go to the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and don't go shopping. We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. yours sincerely  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Last July, I went to spend two weeks with my best  in a beautiful village in the south of France, near Saint-Tropez. We lived in my aunt's house who was in the center of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there is a house with  swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was the famous French singer's house. One night, I heard a strange sound. I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine. They went into the house through a window. I though it was some rubbers. I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone to the police. I went near the house and waited to look what it would happen. After ten minutes, one man came out with a big bag and went into his car. When the other man came out, I caught him and fighted him. The first man went away, because a police car arrived. The policeman came to take the bugglar and thanked me  to catch him. ",26.00
332," Saturday, 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir, I am writting  you in order to obtain you my money back, concerning the musical show: OVER THE RAINBOW. I live in France and I recently spent a week's holiday in London. I decided to go to  theatre to have a nice evening. I saw your advertisement in a newspaper. It seemed to be very attractive. But in fact it is not! I had a very disappointing evening. First of all:  actors  were mentionned  are not the same  . I supposed to see the famous Danny Brook, and what a surprise it was  not him. I was very disappointed. Secondly the show had go on 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanations. Thirdly it said that ""discounts available"". This is not the truth. After that it suggested  to visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed! It is a shame. And you write, I quote  ""your perfect evening out"", excuse me but I do not agree with you. It was awful, the worst evening out of my life. So please, it would be fair, that you give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you in a near future. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  ""What will clothes be like 100 years from now?"" In my opinion, clothes will not change so much, because fashion is an eternal cycle. You will find always  basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change. We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included. For example: a short very classical   inside of it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find too some buttons, to have.. fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe on your watch you would have a screen to watch your favorite soap operas. Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadgets with old clothes, like a dress of the middle-Age. Do not worry about this, it will not happen! Fashion is always the same!

957," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thanks for your letter. I have reading the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize. About the time when I like to travel is only July, because in the summer is it very busy at work. People where I working with they are going on holiday in Juni and August. So hey need me at work in that months. Further the accomodation I  prefer at Camp California is the log cabin. Because, at first when I was a little child we were staying every holiday in a small house and I like that. At second, I don't like tents and I don't get used to it, so I prefer log cabins. About the different activities we like them all, but If I choose two I take sailing and tennis. In the summer I'm sailing  races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes. I'm not very good in Tennis but I can practise on my travel. Finally, I have one question about the money. Which things I must paid for on my travel? Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thanks for your letter. How are you? With me is everything fine and the pop concert was great. I enjoyed helping at the popconcert, but it's very stressful work. You always walk from side to side to move things and there's no break. Some other work what I have done was to lead the people to there places. We have worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food. The most beautiful things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams. He's friendly and very handsome off course. If you see the famous singers in reality they are different and the most singers they haven't time for you. Another thing I have done was the make up  only for about fifteen minutes. That was very nice, because I didn't expected that. There were some people they gave me some advise  to clean the face and etc. Finally, it was a very nice day with great experience. Loves ",23.0
101," Dear Manager of The Circle Theatre. I'M WRITING TO YOU TO EXPLAIN MY DESAGREABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE THE LAST SATURDAY, IN YOUR SHOW ""OVER THE RAINBOW"". FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY DURING ONE MONTH. MY INTENTION WAS TO SPEND AN SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL!!! YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATER AND WITH ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE ENTRY. BUT IT WASN'T THE WORSE, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES  TO PLAY ON THE THEATRE. BUT WHAT CANNOT I FORGIVE TO YOUR COMPANY IS TO CHANGE THE START AT THE LAST MOMENT, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISSAPOINTED. IT ISN'T ALL. WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER, AS YOU PUBLISHED ON THE PROGRAMM, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS ON PUBLIC WORKS!!! YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER. NOBODY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES, AND WE WANT THAT YOU GIVE US BACK THE MONEY . I FEEL YOU LIE  ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT SERIOUS. I WAIT  YOUR ANSWER, AND  OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Your's faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat wasn't the most popular boy in the school. He was shy, reserved and a very closed person. He enjoyed himself reading,  playing piano at home. Despite his way of live, his best friend was Anna, the most popular girl in the school. She explained everything what happened in her live to Pat. When Pat was 16, he decided to change his way of live, spending more time with friends, but what he could do to have some friends? Definately the worse. He started to ""sell"" the secrets of Anna to all the boys of the school who were interested in her. All the boys of the class went to Pat to know what Anna was doing in every moment, and Pat was becoming 'friend' of all the boys. He was very happy, because he felt that everybody loved him. Everyone, less Anna. She didn't tell him anything more, and Pat didn't have any secret to sell to his ""new friends"". At least, Pat didn't have any friend, because he didn't have anything to sell about Anna. Is it moral, to get some friends  destroying and hurting another people? I think NO! And you? ",25.0
0," Dear Ms Jane Clark, Recently I visited an arts festival, organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of its creation  is great. However, I have some proposals about its improving next year. At first, I propose  to invite stars and artists not from all  the world, but from only six countries. This change will give   opportunity to create some different performance. The second my proposition is about  classic concerts. I suppose that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about it  in advance. This year I noticed that there were only  few plays and films. From my point of view, there should be more films because this part of the festival is interesting for people. And, at last, I should congratulate you with the decision of making one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is convinient both for  people and  organisators. I hope you will consider my proposals. I am looking forward for this festival next year. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Ana, Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice . The things you wrote about in your letter are quite common for me, because we, actually, have some problems about our rules. At first, about school. I'm really fed up with our school forne! It is awfull! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. Off course, if we had such pretty forne like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment. What should I say  you about home... We are quite  friendly family, that's why we actually don't have some special rules. However, we promised our perents to make  cleaning up every week. This is all I wanted to write  you about rules. I miss you very much. I'm looking forward to see you next summer after my exams. Write  me  what do you think about it. Kisses to your family, ",25.00
129," Dear Sir, I am writing to complete about my being to the Circle Theatre during my last week's holiday in London. I have seen a musical show and it was not my favourite time. I am confusing because of playing different actor in place  Danny Brook. Secendly, the show started at 20.15. This is why I was feeling invited to your restaurant after  show. Unfortunately, I found closed doors and any information about the reason. I would like to add that being a student I find discounts very important for my budget. Neither without any reason  it was not available. I will  gladfull if you will send my money back. Your faithfull,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason whe we were  horrible troubles with  police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk with us. Let's  back to the beginig of this story. I with my friends had  holidays and decided to spend a few days on a ""island"". We called this place like this, because it was a  land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning on a land - to our town. There was no light during nights so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was a walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered a gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place when  robber keept stolen gold from  bank. We found the solution of this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but... I think you are able to imagine what was happen later. ",21.0
1222," Dear Mrs Smith, I have recieved your letter this morning. I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group. I hope that these informations below are very useful to you, during your attempt of  conference. I have booked a hotel not far off from our school. The hotel is called  Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00. There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk. You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00. You will than have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage. The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you to leave  hotel by 12:00. The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the collage road and turn left toward the end, you than keep going straight, you will eventually see the main entrance of the collage. When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all knows where the conference is and when. At the end of the conference, we will have a party. The party is to let all the students  to know each other better. The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room. I will suggust them to wear formal clothing, as in tie, trousers and blaser. For the afternoon free time on the last day. There are a wide variety of choices  that they can do. They can play tennis, do athletics, swimming... and many other sports event in our school, if they want to. Or they can also visit the Epsom Town. There are shops which sales cloths, foods, and books ... They can decide what they want to do, it's entirely up to them. I am looking forward to seeing you and hop you have a safe flight over to England. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear group leader, Welcome to Taiwan. This report is based on an interesting building, where you can take, for your students to visit. This building is situated in Taipei, the capital. The building is called  Chiang Kei-shek Momerial Hall. Nearly everyone knows where this building is, so if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building. The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds. As you go into the main Hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei-shek, this is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in History. The statue is about 20 feet high. Next to the statue is protected by the guards, the guards will change every four hours. Apart from the main Hall, there are also lots of other gallaries. In these gallaries there are Historical paintings, antique furnitures which Chiang used. These treasure are very old, even older than the history of America. All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang during the defeat in China. They are all been well look after. As well as all the treasures, statue and historical paintings...There are also restaurent's and modern gallaries. When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with historical thing, you migh as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern. Finally, if you went to visit this building I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called  Hyatt Hotel. It only take about five minutes if you walk. I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan and I hope you will enjoy the building.  ",36.00
426," Dear Sirs, The Circle Theatre was so far the best theatre in my opinion, but now, I must change my opinion. I visited your Theatre yesterday. I would like to see the best musical show with the best artists. Unfortunately instead of Danny Brook we have seen  unknown actor. We have disappointed. Moreover this show did not start at 19.30, but 45 minutes later. Another problem - the tickets for students according to your advertisement should be available with discounts - unfortunately I could not buy such  ticket. During the interval I would  drink coffee in  theatre restaurant - it was closed. I don't know, why? I no thought, that so serious  theatre makes such mistakes. In accordance with, I would like to ask you to return me my money. I hope that your answer will be positive, and in the future in your theatre all will be O.K.

During the next fashion shows we observe new clothes. In my opinion in the future people will wear clothes made of a natural fabrics; silk, cotton, leather, wool. All syntetic material will be uncomfortable for these people. Women will prefere the long skirts and short blouses and jackets. Of course, it will be smart clothes. Young people will wear jeans and T-shirt. Such clothes is comfortable and easy in using. Teenagers have not free time to go to a washing-cleaner. Men will wear as usualy - a suit. Fashion colours - it will be earth colours: grey, blue, yellow, brown. For special ocassions, for example - the party, the concert, people will wear very smart. I think that it will be: dresses,  suits swewed by the well-known tailors.  All materials should be thin, delicate and soft, because of the warmly climate. I think that, we will observe a little and slow changes in fashion, but I hope that new clothes will be always pleasent for people. ",23.0

1121," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing about our class trip to London. First of all, I appreciate you well-organised programme, especially,  ""River Trip to Greenwich"" which we requested. It would be the most excising activity in this trip. However, I saw the advertisement of ""THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW"" in the newspaper today, and told all  classmates about it. We are very interested in going  this show. So I would like to suggest you to change the part of  programme for visiting this show. This show is held in  Central Exhibition Hall, London on Tue. 14, March, and  open from 10:00 to 19:00. We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles which we will learn  next term. Therefore, I think it is  great idea to visit the show for our knowledgement. Furthermore, the addmission is free for students. Unfortunately, our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme. For example, ""shopping on 14, March' can be changed to 15, March instead of ""Free time"". So we will be able to use the time at the afternoon on 14, March for visiting the show. I hope that you would give us an opportunity to visit the show. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people said that famous people such as politicians, and film stars, needs to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. I strongly agree with this. Firstly, most people might remember the sad story of ""Princess Diana"" she died in Paris  few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called ""Paparach"". If she was not followed by journalists, she wouldn't die. So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without  private life could be the victim. But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion. Moreover, people are interested in their life style. I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after ""Princess Diana's"" accident. However, secondly, famous people are not ""ailen"" so that they might do something, for example, ashame things in  public space or argument with  partner or family even put on  swimming costume like us. So they can be just ordinaly people like us. We have to think about  this way. Overall, people should think  if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need  private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life.

307," Dear Mr Brown, I'm writing this letter to you to make a complain about the ""Over the rainbow"" musical show which I saw yesterday. I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because by seing your advertisment I expected more That show was entirely different to what it says on the advertisment . I arrived at the theatre at 19:30, found my seat and waited for forty-five minutes, with two hundred other people for the show to start. When it finally started I noticed that the famous actor Danny Brook was replaced by someone who was not as good as him. Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show. After some time a few of them started to leave the theatre. I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the hole show, which by the way was the worst I had ever seen. I don't know why I payed £20 with no discounts as the advertisements said it woul have. Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I wasted my time by coming here. I became furious when I saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to work  . So, I went home as fast as I could to write you this letter. I don't care what you will do about the theatre but I want my money back because this wasn't the perfect evening out you promised it would be.  [SEP]  The last forty years, technology has been growing very fast. first it was used only by the military or by scientists but  the last twenty years modern technology is found in any house, rich or poor and it helps people do hard work. Most houses have many electric devices like  microwave machine, an oven a mixer, a dish washer and many other things which can do a job by the press of a button. The last ten year computers had entered almost every house, especially in rich countrys. Competers entirely changed people lives. Children can play games on it or watch a film. There are millions of things you can do with a computer. You can listen to music and generally use it for fun but the primary reason that computer were invented was for communication. There are hundrets of prograns which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger which you wanna meet. Millions of people use computers for this reason. The general conclusion about computers is that they help people to have easier lives by doing hard work and helping them. They are important to people who like to have fun with games and they are, maybe the best way to communicate with someone you know or a person you want to meet ",28.0
684," 13th JUNE 2000 Dear Miss Helen Ryan, I am really glad for reciving the first priec in your competition, I will be very plesant joining the holliday. According to your first question, I would like to travel only at July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any class. I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as closest as possible to nature, it makes me feel better. As a regard for activities I would choose singing and surfing, surfing because it is my favourit sport, I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good on it, and singing because I really love it, I am not as good on singing as I am on surfing but I like doing it. I would like to ask about somethings which might be necessary for me to take with , like what kind of clothes should I take, should I take my own surf board, and what about money, should I bring some with me? I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  13th JUNE 2000 Dear Kin, As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand for the band called RAMONES. It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well, those guys really know how to play rock. I had only to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted. When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them, some of the girls started to take their clothes of, which was the best part for me, but some of  securities went there and took them away. Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they went back from their break they've just went of. I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've prefered to stay at the front with the others people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I holp to be able to help them next year. I holp you've enjoed my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon. See yah mate ",33.0
609," Dear Sir or Madam Thank you for the letter. It was great to hear from you. I was surprised that I have won. By the way, I would like to travel in July, because just I have free time in July. Moreover, I am keen on in summer. As can be seen from your letter, I can choose Accommodation. I would prefer to stay in tents. One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel wild life more than  I stay in log cabins. According to your letter, there are 10 main activities which I can choose 2 and play while I am on the holiday. I would like to play Basketball and Golf. Both of them I am not as good as you expect, but recently I have been intrested in those. Finally, I would like to ask some question such as  clothes and money. What kind of clothes are much to the camp? Furthermore this is  first time I have been to abroad therefore I don't know how much money I should bring. I am looking forward to hearing from you yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear kim How have you been doing recently. I have been busy anyway. I want to tell you how much I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was  begining of this summer. One of my friends suggested that we should have had  part time job which was that. Both of us are keen on pop music. Although at first I didn't wand to do it, because it was in summer. It must have been hot. Howeve, we decided to have the job, because of good money. Howeve it was  great job I haven't hade such  experience . I could see a great number of pop stars in front of us. Can you believe that. My job just prepear drink for them. Moreover one of  famous stars gave me a sign. I will never forget at that time. I must sign off as I want to catch the post. Could you being in touch and send back a letter. A big hug from me ",26.0
491," Dear Manager, With this letter I want to show  you some problems I had last week in your theatre with your show. First of all, I want to introduce myself. I'm Francesco Schein, I'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very upset because the show had many problems. First the actor was changed and his  performance was very poor and disappointing. Then, the show began 45 minutes later, so we had to wait  very long . The advertisement said there were discounts available, which were not . At the end you said it will be a Restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything untill we got home. I hope you understand your faults and I'm asking you for the money back. Faithfully Yours  [SEP]  I don't know if technology has totally changed my life, because I was born with it and I have learned  it since I was a little boy. For example, I was born knowing the man has stepped on the moon. There are some machines which have helped in my development, and others which help me to make my life easier. The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in past time, when everything was send by common mail, and it took weeks till it got  the right place. There are other machines which are bad for the environment. Many industries throw their contaminated air away, without cleaning it before. Technology has to move further so it can solve problems  as pollution, so we can live better and longer. ",22.0
206," Dear Mr Manager With reference to the show last week. I am writing to complain about the show, which was very disappointed. In the advertisement, it state that the actor for this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE. As a result I asked my acquintance to come with me to the show. As soon as the show started. I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY. I was very disappointed. In addition the concert didn't start on time. It was  quarter of an hour late. If I knew that the show was going to be late, I would ask my mom to come with me, because her working hour ended at eight o'clock. The restaurant was closed after the show ended. On the other hand there were no discounts available, as a result I had to paid extra money for the tickets. In conclusion it wasn't a perfect evening, I didn't enjoy it at all due to the failure advertisement. I would like to ask for my money back. Your sincerely Thatt Chitchee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As a result Mallory had been arrested by the police two years ago. In addition he had to serve a life sentences. The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat had planned the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. As a result the only way to get into the building was at the top of the build. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in at the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond. He ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him. By the time he got out of the building, the cops was ever where but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his unpredicatable mind. He ran into the old build, and hidden a diamond in there. Unfortunately the building was a police station. ",25.0
499," Dear Sir, I believe that you must be the manager and I would like to point some complaints of mine about the play ""Over the Rainbow""  Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you've placed another actor in his place, which was very disappointing. Moreover, the theatre's play was expected to start at half past seven in the afternoon, however it started at quarter past eight! We had to wait all that time without someone to explain  us the reason for this delay. To make matters worse, your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that it was being under construction for the expansion of that place. This so-called ""Perfect Evening"" was so disappointing as well as discouraging  of coming to your Circle Theatre again. After all I've been through, I would like a refund of my money. Thank you for your interest. Sincerely yours,   [SEP]  Nowadays, the technology has expanded its ""legs"" to almost every part of our interests, jobs and even hobbies. Therefore, our life has changed a lot since a hundred years ago, as well as mine did. The biggest achievement of modern technology has broken into my house as soon as I was at the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in my studies, homeworks and projects for school. With the Internet, I got more socialised using the Relay Chat clients, but also got a kind of boredom, which is known as ""Internet Freak Disease""! I use it a lot so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands. Moreover, fishing was affected by the modern technology. Fishing is my hobby and that's why I bought these plastic worms and fish, that are not so good - it's better to use alive worms! To sum up, my life is surrounded by modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It only depends of your judgement and the way you're about to use technology. ",23.0
853," Tito Torres Vargas ELIZABETH GASKELL COLLEGE Manchester, UK Helen Ryan Competition Organizer Dear Madam, Thank you for this great opportunity to travel with you for free! I entered the competition you organized but never expected to be the lucky winner. I could only travel on the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th. The accomodation that best suits me is in log cabins, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to have all my belongings in order and packed at all times. In respect of the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose in such a hugh variety, but I prefer to do those I better know  as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practise new techniques and take pictures of new landscapes. Please send me a list of the items I many need there, including the most appropriate clothes for the american weather. I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with an unlimited budget whatever they need? And finally who has all the time needed to do so? There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe. Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy  - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' age where money was not even invented. With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits  as overspending,  could lead to serious problems. At the end all depends in our attitud to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products  before going shopping. But even without money to spend  is fun to rush from time to time in the sales that seasonaly appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms. Shopping may be enjoyable or not at all! ",40.0
399," The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show ""Over the Rainbow,""  I attended to, a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset  when I realized that the  expected famous actor Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy; this entertainment did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. More over, I was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing  as, indicated on your adverts, but I, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it  happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. ""A Perfect evening out""!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque of £15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had made my own experience with her so far and I would be always careful not to tell her anything important when ever we met. As, Pat had recently made a new friend with Olga, my sister, I warned my sibling about Pat's failing: ""Don't ever rely on Pat for keeping a secret, Sweet-Heart; she just can't""! Mind what you may tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping around is her favorite leisure activity! However, I guess that Olga turned a deaf hear to what I had told her. This is the impression I got. A couple of weeks later, my sister called me as I was at work; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears, she could, hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then, feel her, upset as ever. I could get her as well simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably: - ""Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat"", hurled Olga  at me, through the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the ""poor cow""! ",31.0
100," Dear Mr Jones: I'm writting  you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on  your theatre. To begin with, the actor you publised was going to perform, didn't. To make things even worse, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late, at 20:15, and there weren't even your famous discounts available. As it wasn't enough, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and  not very hard to guess  I wasn't able to enjoy it, as for it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to sell food, the perfect ending for the perfect evening. Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go an spend the money in a good play when they do what they've promised. Waiting for your to write back Yours  [SEP]  Modern technology is, nowadays, not only a ""tool"" for every day life but also a lifestyle. People are getting more and more adicted to this, because  helps  every day life to be easier and more confortable. In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. From a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio to a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play  or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school. I think that anything that can make our lifes better, should be done, because that way we wouldn't have so many things to be concerned about, and we would be able to live a happier and more relaxed life.

804," Dear Helen Ryan, I have happily received your reply letter and I want to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only period of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should give me a good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity and entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis for you. I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good in it. At tennis I'm the best player of my whole school and once, I got to the top 10 of my country in tennis . I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring? Money, how much should I bring. Would $200 be enough? Well that's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely Basilio Romero  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shoke our hands. I'll never wash my hands again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon. Basilio Romero ",35.0
942," I'm so happy that I've won 2 weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. At first I couldn't belive that I was a winer I would like to travel at the Camp in July, if is possible. This is just one months which I've fee.  I'm a student. My school starsts in September and it finishes in June. July is  months when I'm having a rest and I'm doing nothing. In August I'm working in the shop which is my sister. If I could go in July  would be greate. I can sleep in  tent, it would remain me  a good time which I'd spent with my friends a few years ago. I'm not scared of darkness, rain, cold or hot whether. I'm sure  would be good fun; sleep next to each other telling scared story. Is good for make friends, you can know them better doing everything together. Also I know that I have the chance to do two activities while I'm at the Camp. I would like to choose basketball. This is  sport which I ,,love"". I play basketball since I was 12. Some of my friends say that I'm  very good player, but I don't think so. Another sport which I'd like to do is swimming. In swimming I'm not as good as  in basketball, but I'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it. I would like to ask you, what sort of clothes shall I take with me? I don't want take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costium, T-shirt, sports shoes I think should b O.K. Know, I can just wait for July  [SEP]  Hi Kim! How are you? I'm fine. I'm so exited. Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine. It was  Tina Turner concert! To this moment when I'm thinking of it I want shout. At first I was helping to seill the tickets -  wasn't difficult. Anyway, four hours, before  concert had started, I was helping with  lights. We had to check evey plug, switch, lights. I couldn't belive how big the lamp can be. That's why singers are hot. When  concert had started and Tina cam out I forget about lights, just I was looking at her. fortunetly nothing had happend. Every-thing was O.K After  concert we were invited in backstage. then I could see her very, very clear. Just people who was helping and organizating this concert could meet her. Some of them were speaking with her, I wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm happy, that I could be thear. ",23.0
18," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related with what I saw in the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find. First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible of this good idea. It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city. And what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character. But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural. Secondly, there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket, due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use. Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, as ska or ethnical music. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Who doesn't want to earn some money? The topic says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them. If you still don't have economical freedom from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you. One possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best, and, then, ""sell"" it to the people. For example, you can   dance folk be Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country. You must be aware, anyway, of the difficulty of this kind of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on) But maybe you are too shy to do this. In this case, you can cook some cakes and sell them near a school or in the centre of the city, as well as other traditional products: cheese, honey ,chocolate... Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures. You don't need to be a Picasso, it's enough with a bit of imagination. If you don't feel like doing any thing of this, you have alternative solutions. If you like fishing, you can try to colaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you can achieve by yourself. Finally, if anything of the above  result, you can prepare the classical parties in discos or work as a babysitter It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money. ",30.00
520," Manager of the theatre: I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed. I'm not from here (this city), so I wanted to know everything about it: it's culture, history and the famous musicals. Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical show. I went to the theatre to see at what time was the show, 19.30, it was O.K. so I bought a ticket. In that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that mean, that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 mins, the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, it was a different actor. In that moment I was realy angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad cleaning and food. That was too much. ""Dear"" manager I hope you to understand me, so I ask for money back and I hope this wont happen again. By  [SEP]  First of all I think we have grown  with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our live, but we can think about it. How has it change my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life comfortabler. Now I only used to push a button, and things or mashines work on their own. Homework is easer to find in the cumputer than in a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology go so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it make us thing more about my future job. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things worked and that scare me, I will be useless, because a mashine will do all the work. ",26.0

At the beginning I would like to answer  questions you asked me in your letter. The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off (I am in charge of  project which starts in June so I am sure I couldn't go later). 'As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in  photograher's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in  cathegory of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started  few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would like also to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is. I want to thank you ones more for taking me into consideration in your competition. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Juliana Piotrowska  [SEP]  Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end. What did you feel? You had to be disappointed. There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time. Moreover, you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager. This leads to an escalation of your anger. Sometimes you could find a bargain. You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price. But at home you noticed that there is a tear on  sleeve. And you couldn't of course give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee. You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money. Somebody could give you not enough change. How would you feel? Deceived? So if you don't want to feel deceived or offended, think twice before you decide to go shopping. (A very depressing point of view, isn't it?) ",36.0
1081," 12th December 2000 Dear Mister Robertson, The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm, which you have organised for our trip to London. The reason why I'm writting to you is the class and I have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 am - 19.00 p.m. It is a show about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all are interested in fashions and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for as because students have not to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour. I would like to suggest  you how the programm could be changed. Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wedensday afternoon in our free time. What are you thinking about this suggesten? I hope you will unterstand this kind of matter and the class and I  looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot. First point  we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or  internet. In the future they both getting closer and closer. That means for exampel while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or chees. Or never living the office you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath. So in fact people's home became more confienence and comfortabler. I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furnitures of people's home will not change as well. ",21.00
73," Dear Ms Clark, I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich is a great idea. I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. As I saw on the advertisement, there were stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries . It would be better if there were more than six countries. I noticed that some concert halls were too small. I wonder if you could offer outside concerts. Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films. Don't you think you could create dramatic courses? Visitors could learn plays with professionals. Finally, the idea of a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we pay only once and we can see all the events. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerly,  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter which I've just received. You ask me to tell you about school rules and what we are allowed to do at home in France. I don't think the rules are so different between England and France but I'm going to try to give you examples. Firstly, at school,  we missed a course, we must bring a medical attestation. Furthermore, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE. At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss  with our family. There are so many rules but it would be too long if I had to explain all of them. l'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, ",31.00
355," Sir Manager, My name is Sandre Atos, I am writting to you because this last weekend I went to the theatre, you manage, to see what was called ""London's newest and best musical show"". However, I must say, it was quite the opposite. First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced for a disappointing actor. Besides  the spectacle was setted up to   19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe in that, everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud. I was told that I would have a perfect evening, though instead of that I had a terrible one. That's why I am writting to ask for some money back, I believe I have this right.  [SEP]  Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing  could ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day  television came to my house, I was only seven, everybody was exciting about the new ""toy"", however what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned  to rule our lives. Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights, playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to science development, I am getting better, recovering from ahsma. In addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat, thanks for the microwaves invention. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological facilities, but a very happy and united family. ",30.0
502," Dear Sir, I am writing to your to complain about the musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" As a matter of fact, I waited for seeing Danny Brook who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he wasn't here. Besides, the actor who filled him in was unknown and specially boring. Secondly, the show had to begin at 19.30 pm, in fact he began at 20.15 pm and that without any explainations! Your advertisement mentioned that discounts were available, however when I asked for them to the staff they replied to me that they weren't  discounts! After the show, I wanted to visit your restaurant and once again, I was disappointed because it was closed. Anybody could explain to me why! I can assure you that it wasn't a perfect evening out and I got very annoyed about this evening which could have been wonderful. That is the reason I would like you to refund my money. I hope you would take notice of this complaint seriously. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life changed in some ways when I got the hand of using new technologies. When I started work, I wrote everything I made on sheets and if sometimes I made mistakes, I had to cross  out and it wasn't very well-made. I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate. Now, I enter datas and I don't need any more to calculate my figures, the work is completely made by the computer and in addition there is no mistake. If I have to find out  timetables, it is very useful to have the possibility to see  on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! At the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for . But after a while you gain experience and you get soon used to this kind of research. Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobil phone. As a matter of fact, if I am stuck in my car in the traffic, I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I would be late. Once, I saw an accident and I could call the police. Sometimes the ring is annoying but finally, the mobil phone is a great handy object. ",30.0
296," Mr. Jones: I write this letter to informed you about the bad experience I had last week in one of the shows your are presenting. I recive a paper where I was told about a play you are presenting and of the advantages I would recive if I go to see it,  think that never happend. I am realy desappointed, and I want to have my money back. First of all, in the sheet I recived, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actor, thing that is not true, because insted of him, there was another actor, that I don't know what's his name is. Second, it says that the play would start at 19:30, and it realy started at 20:15. Third, I was told that I can have some discount, and when I was buying my ticket, the lady in the cabin told me that that discount doesn't exist. After that, when the show was finished, I was going to the theatre restaurant, and a man that works there told me that it was closed, and he don't want to give me  reasons. You can see that you promise me I'll have a good evening and I realy don't have it. So I suggest, you give me my money back, or I would go to the police, because you lie to me and you know what it means. thank you.  [SEP]  Cry Freedom - John Briley Dear Anna: I write this letter to tell you about the program that tomorrow starts, about that exelent book I have told you to read. This exelent book tells the story of a man of 25 years that have a little boy, his son, that lives in  very bad condicion. The story shows you the life that many people have to deal  every day. Shows you how they affront it and what is life, real life. The book is very easy to read, but if you don't have time I recomended to listen  the program. I have been told that they will interview a lot of people of different part that have read the book, and  tell  their experience. Also, that they would invite  psicologist, the Autor of the book and may be the president would talk so I recommend you to hear it. I hope you listen to it, because I thing that if you want to become a M.P., it will teach you a lot of thing, and you would learn more about England reality. your friend for ever. ",22.0
730," Dear Ryan Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition. I am writing to inform you  my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July. I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July. And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent. I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel  wilder experience. While I am at the camp, I would like to enjoy swimming and photography. It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy  fresh air. Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can. I would like to know about the weather in the camp area because I don't know what kinds of clothes I have to bring. And I want to know how much money I have to carry for personnal expences. I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping. Thank you for your kindness and I look forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Clark. ",12.0
847," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure. Firstly, the date I would like to travel on would only be in July. Since I am a full-time student, I will not have finished my lessons until the end of June. In addition, I will be busy with my cousework in August. Regarding to the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to the nature. I am sure I will have a lot of fun and release myself from the busy study totally. I am pretty good at painting. I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college. On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six. Tennis is my favourate sports evant. So I would like to choose these two activities while I am at the Camp. Lastly, I have some questions to ask you. Since I have never been to  U.S.A, I know nothing about it. Would you like to tell me how much  should be taken with me as pocket money and what shall I wear at that time ?  I will be grateful for your help. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it. However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO. Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt? Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable? More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style in this new generation! ",36.0
471," 17 June, 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I visited your theatre a couple of days ago in order to see the musical show titled 'Over The Rainbow'. I was not satified with the show at all because it was very different from the information your advertisement had stated. First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation . Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner. I had planned to have dinner there after the show. What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time during my holiday in London. I do hope you will understand my feelings and send some money back. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had known that but I told my secret to her, which was a big mistake. It was just an usual day. Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin. Pat was very surprised but soon she began asking me lots of questions about him. I didn't mind telling her about my cousin, actually he isn't different from other boys at all, he just has sweet-looking. Next day, I went to school as usual and got agog at a large number of girls waiting for me around my rocker. They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend. Now I'm asking my cousin either to meet my friends, or to quit being a singer right now. ",33.0
925," Dear Sir or Madam, I am glad to hear that I have won first prize, two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would like to travel in July because I will have my off in July. I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent. I think it would be more comfortable than a tent. I want to join swimming and tennis courses. I have been swimming from my  five years of age  until 1993  as a member of  school team. I am good at timing on swim. I am also good at playing tennis. I won a prize in a competition in 1999. I would like to ask about the money. Is everything free? Do I need to bring money for anything extra? but also I would like to learn about clothes. Do I need any special clothe? Will you provide it? and Do I have to pay for clothes? If you  reply  my letter until  28th of June I'll be pleased with it because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  - SHOPPING - Who doesn't like shopping? Everybody likes  from a child to an old lady in  sixties but it is not always enjoyable. When you get home tired after spending all your morning and afternoon at shopping you'll want to go to bed because you were looking for only a suit during all day and you couldn't find the perfect one. The only thing is we need to know what kind of thing do we want to buy and where could we buy cheaper and more quality stuff. We have  few possibilities. We can look up a magazine or a booklet which deliver with  newspaper weekly. We can order a free book from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is the internet shops recently so you don't need to see long-face staffs in the shops. You won't wait in the quee. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer. I think you won't be tired and bored   end of your shopping on the computer. Think about  that way for enjoyable shopping. ",29.0
825," Dear Helen Ryan I have just received your letter, and thank you very much for your reply. I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need: First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month. Secondly, if you don't mind, I would prefer to sleep in a tent. Although it is not very comfortable, I like camping very much. Thirdly, I am very interested in swimming and also climbing. I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on . I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city. Finally, could you tell me what I need to dress and also how much money I will spend on. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I have  asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable. In fact, to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons: Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in  few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes, which you don't really need. Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them. In my opinion, doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially  I am depressed, nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet. ",24.0
497,"  Dear manager of the Circle Theatre Last Sanday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the theatre you were supposed to present. We thought that it was a good chance for us to watch it. ""Over the rainbow"" was supposed to start at seven thirty. We went there on time. We waited ther for forty five minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it. We really got bored as all the other peaple there. We were very disappointed because before this happened we pouded the tickets but there were no discounts available. And then delate forty five minuites to present the show. Then we expected to, see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook. That was very disapponted. Fortunately the show finished. We decided to visit the theatre restaurant. But it was closed!! That was  bad organized evening we thought. When we asked why was it closed the people there told us that they did not organized it before I must admit that, that evening wasn't the perfect one out for me but I and for my friends either. It was the worst evening that we all ever had. My friends and I demand our money bacck real soon. And please do not be very suprised If you recieve more letters about this  [SEP]  Unfortunately; Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I did a big mistake by trusting him. What a fool was I. Last Wednesday my sister told me that our grandmother had a serious illness and she was going to die. She told me to tell none. We didn't want out grand-mother to find it out at that moment so we was trying to keep it secret. I knew Pat, my cousin, loved our grandmother very much. She and Pat had a special relationship. Despite the fact that I had to tell nothing I thought it was right to tell Pat the truth. After a lot of thought I told it to him. Pat started screaming and shouting. I knew he couldn't stand it. But I was sure he would tell nothing. I was wrong. He told me that he had to tell it to my grandmother. I couldn't do anything. Just as Pat left my house he went right away to the hospital. He found her there. And the worst happened. My grandmother was very sensitive and bored  life and when she heart it her condition became more serious. After two days she died. Pat my sister and I felt very rensposible. But there was nothing we could do. We knew we had lost her for ever. ",25.0
485," Dear Sir/Madam. My name is Veronika. And I visited your theatre to see a musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am writing to you to say that it was a very disappointing evening. And I'll try to explain why. First of all, there were the different actors in a show, but you didn't say anything about it before the show. The other point was the beginning of the show. It started at 20:15, but it was said that it starts at 19:30. As a result I missed my train. The third problem was the discounts. There were no ay discount at all. But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with the discount. And the last disappointment was your restaurant after the show. It was closed because of the lack of stuth Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So as a conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully. With the best wishes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? We know that everything is changing. And of course the technology is also changing. Not so long ago we had to do many things by our hand, but now there re a lot of machines to do the same. And it makes our life easier. Now we have free time to do anything else, while  machine is doing our work. It's connected with our house, our workplace and e.t.c. For example, earlier I used to wash my clothes by hand, but now I have the last version of wash machine and now there are no any reasons to do it by hand. Earlier it took me 3 hours, but now it is my free time and I can go for a walk with my friends. Another example is that earlier we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy. Now we have a scanner and a printer to do it. And it takes bout 1 minute to make a copy but not 1 hour. So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the   really important for our life things. ",28.0
436," Mr Jon Stevens, Last month I have been in London for a week to visit your wonderful city and with the intention of seeing at your Thetre the famous musical show Over the rainbow but in all my life I have never had such a disappointing evening. First of all my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets. The starring changed and this was the worst surprise I could have . My greatest wish was seeing Danny Brook's performance; you know it's the best singer. But instead of him there was a unknown young actor. What a pity, I thought. I arrived there in time, 19:15 in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected. I hadn't tought for a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should had to be a luxury restaurant where I could eat. But it was closed because it was under construction. Because of the quality of the evening I spent, the only thing you can do is giving me back at least the half of the cost of  ticket. To apologise and give the impression of being a serious theatre. I'd rather I had been at home seeing on TV my  Italy! I hope that my wish is being accepted. Your Sinceraly  [SEP]  We are in the ages of the technologic development  it's out of doubt. What could be out of control of technology? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution, between  17th and 18th century there have been sudden changes in our daily way of living. Nowadays especially in the west area of the world science and technology have done great, enormous steps in directions of the progress. Not only for the great nations, but also for every  their inhabitants. Today it's absurd not knowing how a computer works, or how to use  Internet I can buy, today, a book   being comfortable at home, can communicate with other friends faster than before. I can have my homeworks done by a calculator etc. In  future I wish I could fly on my own! For me it's very important to have my mobile and computer never broken. I think I should become crazy without them, not only me but the majority of us. But sometimes I'd rather to switch them off and think of what I could waste, like love and friendship. I wish all the world would do the same. Vico says that progress gives up when Man have noticed that he have been wasting those values. ",23.0
289," Dear manager I went to the theatre to see a musical show ""Over the rainbow"" and had a very disappointing evening. According to your advertisement, the actor should be Danny Brook, but infact it was  different person. My ticket was for 19.30, but it started very late, it started  20:15. When the show finished, it was too late to catch the train to home. I had to take  taxi. It costed me £30. ""What a waste!,, By the way, I didn't see any discounts for buying tickets. One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I get there for a glass of drink, I don't know why, there was no written notes or information about that. I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out. Would you consider to give  my money back? If the refund is available, it would be grateful. I would look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is one of my colleges in the office. She works with me. We get on very well. She is a single mum. She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understandable. Last week, I missed work on Tuesday, so Pat had to work harder because she was all alone. I appreciated her and she wouldn't mind. I told her the reason that I had to miss the work. My son was in prison. I had to go and see him. I still don't know how it really happens to him. All I know is  about drug smuggling,  that he  involved. I asked to her not to tell anyone, because I didn't want others know about this. I am  very private person. Yesterday morning, I went to  toilet, I overherd two people talking about my son I felt pity on myself and I burst into tears. I quickly got out of  toilet. I don't remember how I finished work that day. Nowadays, it is hard to trust people. No one is perfect. Everybody make mistakes. I decided to forgive my friend Pat. ",28.0
27," Dear Jane Clark, I had a wonderful time at the International Arts Festival. I think this festival is a great idea  to enjoy arts from around the world, but I also have some complaints. First of all, I got disappointed when I found that there were no artists from Indonesia. There were stars and artists from only six countries. Secondly, the concert halls. The performances were great, but some halls were too small to accomodate so many people  there were that day. A crowded hall is not good  to enjoy musics. Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success. I liked  plays and films, and want to see more next year. The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy  arts without worrying about money. So all you need to improve  is to have larger concert halls. I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held using more notice boards. I have no doubt that you will succeed in next year's festival. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I would like to recommend the job, a home teacher. It is a job that you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house. The best advantage of this job is the payment. It is very good considering how less time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home teachers are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it means they take lessons after school, not in a daytime. So, in a daytime, we can focus in our studyings. It is not so easy for every student, though. Because teaching requires a lot of knowledge. You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, for it is your responsibility to provide your student  right information. As you see, teaching is a hard work in some respect. But I am enjoying it and getting a lot out of it. ",30.00

I would like to travel only in July, because I will have  holiday  that time. I'm always having holidays in July it is my favorite time for holidays. For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents, because I use to go  tents  holidays, I like it. From  activities which you offer to me I choose swimming and tennis. I am very good in swimming. I do this sport since I was  child and I really enjoy it. I'm not so good in tennis but I would like to play it for practise. Also I find that it sport is very usefull for my health and does me feel better. It is all about me. I would like to ask you something. At first, which kind of clothes  I need take with me, because I don't know anything about the weather in California, and at tend how much money I will need. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people likes to do shopping. I hate it. I never liked shopping. It always was  trouble for me. I don't like to have many things in my house, I don't like to have many clothes and shoes, and I don't know what else. Just  nesseccary. I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they havn't  interests for  spirit (?),  intelect life. They are loosing time of their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things like sport, reading, chating about ideas which make our lives better. We must do something for help other people to feel better and  usefull. ",21.0
944," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing to provide you with the information you require. First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year  is very hot and I prefer going on summer to going on winter or during  other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter  would be impossible to do. Secondly, I would rather be accomodationed in  log cabins than go in  tens. In my opinion staying in log cabins is funnier and much cleaner. Thirsthly, I would prefer to swimming and playing tennis, because I have been practising them since I was I child, and I think I  very good in each other. Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or  everything is provided for the organisers. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Sorry for not writing  you before, but I have been so busy, because last weak I went to a pop concert to help the singers. First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they are made-up. There, in the room I had to helped them, I mean the singers, to put on theirs clothes, and I had to  make-up  them. A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage. While they were singing a man told me to clean the room, where the singers get dressed. Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes. Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished. What I really liked doing was to helped them with their clothes and to make-up them, because I learnt how to  make-up a person and I spend a few minutes with the most popular grup of the world. Write  me soon. Love, ",21.0
124," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about a musical show which I've seen recently at your theatre. There are several reasones why I wasn't satisfied with it. Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor Danny Brook would play in the show. Despite it, a different actor stared in the performance, which was really disappointing. Secondly, the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be. Thirdly, no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets. Lastly, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show. That evening wasn't my perfect one out, although it was promised to be so in the advertisement. This is the main reasone, why I want to ask for a refund. In my opinion, this would be quite fair. I'm going to visit the Circle Theatre this Sunday. I hope I'll get at least a part of the money I've paid back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. During the centuries man's clothes has been changing and even developing in some way. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more common clothes. I think we can make a conclusion: during the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more common. People's clothes have been changing from metalwear to shorts and miniskirts. That's why I suppose, that man's clothes will be becoming more and more light. I think, they will be made of universal materials, which will be rather light and thin. People won't be embarassed to show the beauty of their bodies. Perhaps, clothes will be rather small. I think, that different tops and mini-skirts will become more popular. Maybe, people will create something even smaller than that. Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps, metalwear will become a craze again. ",25.0
1085," Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for  English class, especially  it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in  English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement  on this week college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles, As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as  dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should  a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost  at all for students. But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go   Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day. But Mr. Robertson, these our suggestions are depended on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us. We are look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future. Have you ever thought about our future home? Living in a high building! But we could have everying we want to. Home might be a mixture with moden styles and  natural view as well. These days a lot of contries have been worried about lands that can't have enough place to build houses. The prises for lands are getting increasing it's because of this reason. So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat. Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors. It means  Japanese are planning for the future home. But what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school. Because we are living in  computerlised life, so we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well. But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in there. And because it'll be a big building we'll  able to see a whole view through the window. In conclusion, our future home will have a natural view like these days home and give people a new technological home life. ",21.00
200," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to express my disappointment about your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I saws the show's advertisement hanging up of a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends. I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good references about your Company and, above all, about the main star, Danny Brook. The problems started in the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist. Moreover, the show was delayed forty-five minutes and the worst of all was that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor. On the other hand, the theatre restaurant was closed because unknown reasons. You promised a perfect evening but it became a big disastrous! I would like some kind of explanation and receive my money back. If you don't agree, I will act consequently. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last Wednesday Carole received a letter. The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters. She didn't recognize the writing. She began to read ""Dear Carolin.. There was only a person who used to call her by this name. It brought a lot of memories back to her. It was long time ago, when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen. He was her first love and also the first who kissed her. Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father's work. When they were saying goodbye Paul  ""I will be the last person who will kiss you"". ""It sounds nice but I don't believe it"" she replied. ""You only have to wait"" he said. But she didn't wait. She got married and had two children. At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they didn't love each other any more. Their love had finished. In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again. Her friend Pat had explained the whole story at her husband. What she would do? ",31.0
252," BRASILIA (DF), JUNE 17th 2000 Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to express my disappointment with ""Over the rainbow"", the musical show which I watched last evening. First of all, according to the advertisement, one of the main actors would be DANNY BROOK who I love. Instead of this, I had to watch the performance of a different and unknown actor who wasn't so great as I expected. Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue more than it's necessary. I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressed and very expensive one, too. There wasn't  discount avaiable for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil. In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago. In conclusion, last night definitely was the worst experience about entertainment I've ever had in my life and that's why I ask you  my money back as a compensation. I'm looking forward to your reply faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship   and the ways  to comunicate to other people as well as our life expectancy. With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access  Internet to comunicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from ourselves. Despite of the distances, we can keep our friendship closely and with a cheaply way. Besides of this, the information goes faster than it used to know and it's avaiable in the same time to every part of the world. On the one hand, our time is taken   to learn how to deal with the new technologies. On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us  support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things. For instance, we can research new manners of improving our quality of life. In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware about how they are introduced in our lives to avoid the dangerous side of the TECHNOLOGY.

247," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the rainbow, that took place in the Circle Theatre. There were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisment. The first problem was about the actors. In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play  main roles. But I was very disappointed when I didn't see them on the stage. The second problem was the time of the play. The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I was waiting for the show for a half-an-hour! The third problem were the discounts. The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not. The last problem was the theatre restaurant. It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunatelly it was closed. To conclude, I am not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a fully refund. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  There are many different creatures on Earth: animals, insects, plants. But the most developed creature is a human. He lived  nearly 10 000 years. During this time men had developed and now are the leading creatures. They built huge cities, destroyed forests, got into space. Now, modern technology has changed our life. And, naturally, it has both advantages and disadvantages. The modern technology, on the one hand, made our life easier. We use different electric kettle. We build big cities, there are hot and cold water, electricity, gas in particulary every home. We use different transport that makes our moving faster, it fastens our life. We communicate with other people by telephone,  mail, we read newspapers, we watch television,  get different information from  internet. But, on the other hand modern technology destroyed our life. Factories polluted the air we breath, shops polluted the water we drink. Many different uncureable diseases appeared. For example: cancer occured in Africa after American nuclear tests All in all, technology made our life better by destroying the environment. In future possibly the technology wouldn't destroy the environment, but we have to do something now, because tomorrow can be too late. ",24.0
1004," Dear Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for your letter! I went in for your competition and I was really anxious about the results. I am surprised that I won the first prize but also very happy about it! Therefore it would be my pleasure to reply to your letter. Firstly, I would like to arrive at the Camp in July if that is possible because I am working and I will not have spare time before this month. Secondly, you are mentioning ""tents or log cabins"" as the accommodation provided. I would rather live in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature I adore the sound of the wind, trees, animals and everything which is surrounding . I could feel the environment. Thirdly, as far as the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming as well as tennis. I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home. I do sports a lot so apart from  tennis I am a member in our local swimming centre. I can reasure you that gradually I am improving my sports skills. Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes do I have to bring with me. Is the weather changeable? I was also wondering if I will need any money. I would appreciate  if you could let me know as soon as possible. I hope the information given will be of use. I have tried to be as helpful as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to you about my previous experience. I know how impatient you are  about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing! As I've told you, last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the ""spactetors"" if you can call them like this. Can you imagine? There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff  worth? You don't even want to know. Apart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert. They had to chose their clothes,  give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect! Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words ""reliability"" and ""responsibility"". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is  far more enjoyable and relaxing. Looking forward to hearing from you.

283," Dear Sirs, I am writing to complain about your musical show which I saw last Saturday. According to your advertisement, one of the stars was supposed to be Danny Brook. However, a different actor play the role instead of him. You can imagine how upset I felt, as I really wanted to see his performance. To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start from 7:30 p.m, it started from 8:15 p.m. What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off. On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available. I was really disappointed at your show. I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and  discomfort which I suffered. I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In these days, young people prefer wearing shabby and scruffy clothes to wearing neat and tidy clothes. In other words, their fashion has become more casual. I think this tendancy will become more common in the future. In general, their parents don't like their fashion. They want their children to wear clothes neatly. When they were young, they judged the other person by his appearance. They also were asked to wear clothes which was in accordance with the occasion. In my opinion, this is still correct. However, people noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind. If someone doesn't have enough knowledge about the event which he attends, even if he wears clothes neatly, he doesn't look like a gentleman. What I want to say is that people don't mind their clothes if he has enough knowledge about what he needs. To sum up, people can wear clothes more freely, in the future. What is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everthing including fashion. ",31.0
120," Dear Manager A few days ago I went to the Circle theatre to see a musical show which it shows in your theatre now. Also it made me very disappoint. There are several reasons that I was not happy about the musical. The first one I am going to complaint about is the actor. I could not see Danny Brook during the show. There was an different actor instead of him. Secondly, the times, it's available  14.30 and 19.30 so I choose 19.30. However it was deleied  it started  20.15. Also I had a student identification card to discount the ticket price but it was unavilable to discount. The theatre restaurant was closed after the show, they said funds are runn out. Those are totally unexpectable so I presume that I would like to get paid for my ticket cost. I ask you to transfor money into this account. Barclays bank 1010-10 1234567 Jon Sun. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all it's difficult say what exactly modern technology is now but I can say for sure it's keep developing and much better than the past. Think about the conputer, the speed of conputer is much faster than before. I even couldn't imagine our p.c can be that fast. Also T.Vs, I guess that I was not able to watch colour T.V if I was born in 1960. T.V colour only consist of white and black. Nowdays the technology is keep develop and the better technology gives us  easier life. Another example, the internet. This is  revolution which has changed our daily life. You can have a shopping on the internet and it might  the fastest way to gather any information you would like to search. However it also can make our life very lazy. This is one other important thing to remember. People who have their  car, they don't attempt to walk on foot even if it is  short distance. The improvement of technology can makes our life easy and in the other way it also can makes our life lazy. ",23.0
362," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  wich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show. The first problem concerned the main actor of the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him. The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the public, including me, was forced to wait for fourty five minutes. It was also written in the show's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets. However, there was not any. The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given. In conclusion, the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back. I would like to hear from you in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything. One day, I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly. I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart. Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love. The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmous saddness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately brake up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore. Now, unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend or a best friend, all because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. ",39.0

The first thing I didwas to controll the tickets of the fans who visited  the concert together with a friend of mine. There always was a lot of security stuff around us to make sure every thing is ok, because there really were thousends of persons. Then we had time to listen to the music. The other thing I had to do was to make some sandwiches and drinks just before they returned behind the stage to rest a little bit before they continued playing. It was amazing to be in the same room they were . Edi Vedder even talked to me about their programms!

There were stars and artists from only six countries. I supposed to see quite various nationality. Secondly, I actually liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much. However, some concert halls were too small for the many people so we couldn't have a enough space. thirdly. I would like to you to consider about having more plays and films next year. It would be nicer. Otherwise, the price was really reasonable for all :events the weekend. I was satisfied with that. And if there was musical event. It would be greatful.

In addition speaking activity include everything  to learn English such as listening, speaking,  grammer as well. Other lesson, the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammer, English culture... etc. It might be good. However all  students are passive. So it can be boring. give a topic and then discussion about it. I know that what my friends think and like. It is real life who we are. Also the film must be funny. If a film is boring, nobody will see it. During speaking, there are lots of  happening such as, some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture.

From my point of view, your organisation has to be careful to orginize an activity. Last week I was in London. I attended to your activity. I'm sorry but I didn't have a good remark of your activity when I left. I know the quality of your organization. That's why I wanted to write  you. First time, when I saw the advertisement on the newspaper, I really appreciated. I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible. Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling. Finally, time passed and it was supposed to begin. But it didn't. I waited 45 minutes more to see the play. Anyway, it wasn't important for me. Because, I believe that if you want to get a satisfaction you have to sacrifice a little bit. But it wasn't all. On the other hand, I couldn't see the same actors whose name were written on the advertisement. I was really shocked. Because from my point of view the buildings of a play are the actors. It was unpleasent for me to see different actors on the stage. In addition, you didn't keep your promise which   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Beatrice was 18 and she could manage. But her father didn't have the same opinion. That's all I knew about her. Days passed. Beatrice and Pat were going everywhere together. Pat had a boyfriend. That's why Beatrice's father never liked Pat. One day Beatrice came  me with some tears on her face. She was crying. I couldn't believe .

72," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to thank you for providing  International Arts Festival. It was  absolutely great idea. However, I would like to give some suggestions for next year as I have read the advertisement. Firstly, could you invite stars and artists from more than only six contries? In my opinion, it might be better to have time with  variety  nationallites. Secondly, the music concerts were very exciting and  had a lot of fun, but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably. Thirdly, I am expecting to watch more films and plays which were impressive. Lastly, it could be nice to students who are interested in  arts, if you help special events, for instance,  song contest, writing competition or dance lessons. To sum up, I hope the festival is developed next year with excellent reasonably-priced ticket like this year's. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  PART TIME JOBS : Find in your place Do you need money? If you do, make sure why you want to earn money. That is very important to find a way for earning and saving money. Probably the best way you can get money is to have a part time job in your spare time. I am recommending you to check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend? - before you request a job. If you just decide to work, you'd better to find a job in your place. Firstly, go to your school or local council. They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you. Secondly, as your family or friends. As they know about your interestings and personality, it is easy to help you. In my case, I could get a telephone researcher part by my friend's reference. In conclusion, don't forget that a job is just spent in your ""spare"" time. That's it! ",26.00
386," Dear Sir, A few days ago, as I was having a week's holiday in London, I read your advertisement which convinced me to go to see your show: Over The Rainbow. I must tell you that this show was the worst one I had ever been to. First of all, I was very disappointed by the fact that the actors who played were not the ones who were supposed to do it! I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as it was written in your ad! Another problem: there was no discount available! Finally, at the end of this very disappointing evening, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant - which was also mentioned in your ad - but I was told that this latter was closed because of a private party! To put it in a nutshell, contrary to what was explained in the advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back. I look forwards to hearing from you  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it. Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten year old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret for example. Thus when Sally explained  her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very embarassed. In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret. It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have prefered not to know it. Pat was totally upset. She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her. Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, when home,  locked herself in her bedroom. But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it. ",34.0
968," Dear Sir/Madam, I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised  it. It was  absolutely fantastic prize. I am writting  you about your questions. First, I can come there only  July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new turm will also start in September. I would like to stay at long cabins because I have stayed at tents many times in my childhood. The most exciting offer is your activities. I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing. My grand father used to do it when he was a student. After he has got a job, he became busy. However, he retired  his job last year so he has had his own time. If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my grand father. I would like to ask about my clothes and money. How much do I need to bring them? I wish I could see you soon. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? You want to know about my experience at a pop concert, don't you? It was so exciting! My main working was take people to their seat because of a concert hall, which was the millenium dorm. Do you know it? It's the hottest place in England. Most of  people were first time to come there, so they're lost. I had also never been there before. It's a huge building. I also sold a panfulet of that concert, CD and T-shirts. The most exciting experience was that I could met a lot of people. I told you before that concert was performed by Elton John, so there were a lot of famouse people. When I saw Jullia Roberts, I was socked. She was abusolutelly beautiful. I have never seen that kind of long legs in my life! Did you enjoy my letter? I can't explain  you very well. Anyway, it was a wonderful time. lots of love, ",26.0
509," Dear Mr. Smith: I am writting in order to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"". At first, the advertisement said that the show was starring by Tina Truelove and Danny Brook, that was not true, Danny Brook did not act in the show, it was a different actor and I got disappointed with him. In order to the times , the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary. Another thing, the tickets. The advertisement said that there were discounts available, that was false, there were not any kind of discounts. After all  I just wanted to go to the restaurant of the theatre and have something to eat, but it was closed because the police had closed it. They had closed it because they had found the food in  bad conditions. Just to finish, the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out, let me tell  that it wasn't not. I paid  a full ticket without discounts to wait 45 minutes, to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all  could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed. I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do it. Yours faithfully.  [SEP]  Technology. The technology has changed, is changing and it will change our daily lifes. Technology is improving every day, soon everything will be done by a machine. Now we can cook in a easier way than ten years before, we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what's happening in the other part of the world. Another thing  is changing our life is the computer, especially  Internet. More and more people are connecting through the net. Soon we won't need to get out from our homes.

51," Dear Jane Clark, The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend. I believe that the event was good, however I feel that the festival can be improved next year. Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries. I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet  other personalities. Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy  concerts because some concert halls were too small. I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year. Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly. I hope you find my opinion useful. Once again congratulations on the Festival. I hope to hearing from you soon yours sincerelly,  [SEP]  tips  to earn money When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us. there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time. One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it doesn't require special skills, all you need is a lot of patience. If looking after children doesn't fit you, you can try  with pets. Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk. So if you like animals this is your chance to earn  money and have fun at the same time. Another option is to wash your neighbour's car. In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with, but don't worry, soap is not very expensive. the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you, according to the things you like to do. If you don't find anything good enough for you don't worry, you should always remember: It's not all about the money! ",35.00
549," Dear Sir/madam, Thank you for your letter and your congratulations. I never thought that I would win the competition. It is really wonderful. I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right for that time. And for my accommodation. I  prefer live in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I  like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I live in. I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming. Before I came  England, I swam every weekend in my country even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp. Actually, my mind has already gone there, I can't wait even for a minute. I want to go there now. By the way, I would like to know  the shopping especially for clothes, I want to buy some for myself. And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there? I look forward to your letter. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  To: Mr Ted From: Meng Subject: About daily life at our school Introduction This report is aim to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestion about it. What do students do now? Lots of student normally have classes in the morning. And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon. For instance, reading, looking for some information or using  computer. What do they think about it? The arts students want to learn another foreign language. Moreover, some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that aim to the examination. Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon. Recommendations Open some foreign language classes at part-time for the students who is interested in it. Let foreign students do more excises about English to help them pass the exam.

135," Dear Sir/Madam; Yesterday I went to the theatre play called ""Over the Rainbow""  which I saw the advertisement in todays Guardian. I want to tell you that I am very dissapointed about the play. In the advirtisement it is written that Danny Brook was in the starring . However I didn't see him all the night. There was another actor instead of him. And also it should be started at 19.30, as I saw in the advirtisement,  which has started at 20.15! And so far there wasn't any discounts available which is written to be ""available"" in the advirtisement. I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re-decoration progress inside. You should have written it in the advirtisement. And after all  no one can say that I had a perfect evening out! Absolutely it was very dissapointing. so I want my money back. I hope you understand me and correct your mistakes in the next advirtisement and send me my money soon! Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Simple Solutions It is over 50 years since the production of the computer and television. Our lifes changed since then Today every 5 out of 10 pupil can use  computer basicly. And almost everybody has a television in their homes. These 2 devices make my life easier. I can't go out all the time or be with my friends to have fun. So I watch Tv at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window. I play   computer more than watching Tv when I get bored. The internet is the world's largest communication system ever made. I can do anything I want such as buy Cd's watch  film or even buy food. It is really enjable when I chat with pupil.  Internet brought a new way to my live since I started to use it. It is easy and very useful. I can reach any knowledge that I want to. Techology is also important in one subject for me. Transportation. I can't have to walk to school everyday for 8 months, Cars, busses and trains are very useful in daily life. Lots of thing would be hard and boring in my life  I was living in a different time than now. I can easily do what I want. Technology brought simple solutions to my life. ",24.0
670," Miss Helen Ryan: Last week I recived your letter in wich you told me that I won first prize. I am writting in response of it. First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July with my school holidays, in order not to lose classes. I think I would prefer to be in  tents, because I think it is funnier and you can be in more contact with nature, but if I don't like the tents can I change my mind? You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. In both of them I am very good. I did a surf course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life. I have a few questions. How much money should I take to spend in those two weeks? and also what kind of clothes I should take? Please, when you recive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  We are going to do a video about daily life at school, the following classes are the ones I recomend to film. ENGLISH: the classroom is beautifull, and in the same day we do a lot of diferents activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there. CHEMISTRY: We do a lot of experiments and the materials we use are very good. I think that if we film that class the people that watches it will be impress with the equipment we have got. SPANISH: We are doing a play now. We could film it and produce it, instead of uniform we could wear costumes, the ones that are animals could pain their faces. I think that if we do it properly we could have a great spanish play. Those three classes are my choises, I hope we could do them and make a very good video about our school. ",24.0
928," 13th june 2000 Dear Ms Ryam, I was very happy to receive your letter since I was eager to spend some time in the USA. I would like to reach the camp in july, and spend there the last two weeks of the month because in August I must start studying for my examinations. As to accomodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe. As far as activities are concerned I would prefer Basketball and Climbing. I am very good at basketball, and even if I am not a tall boy, I am a good playmaker and I play in a local team. As to climbing I am almost inexperienced but I would like to improve. I would like to ask you  some other things. Which kind of clothes have I to put in my case? I would like to know, for instance, whether the evenings there are cold or hot. Please let me know if the Camp California accepts credit cards I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely Fabienne Mull  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, I was very happy to receive your last letter. As you know I had a great time helping at a PoP Concert. I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me He needed a boy who could help on stage. As you known I can do a little of everything so I accepted. I connected wires, I caried loudspeakers, and so on. When the show started I was on the stage close to  famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie. Towards the end of the concert I hansled a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte. I couldn't believe in it! Poolo Conte asked me to drink with Him. As you know He's my favorite singer. We started talking about music and I asked Him many things about His texts, which are beautiful but sometimes difficult to understand. I think I won't never forget that evening. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. With my best wishes Fabienne ",34.0
962," Warsaw, 13th of June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked to. First of all, the only month I will be able to visit the U.S.A. is July due to the fact that I have already arranged another trip for August. Second of all, I would prefer to live in a tent. I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason of my decision is that other activities are availiable to take also in my county, except climbing, but I have  fear of heights so this one is not destinated for people like me. Furthermore, I would like to ask you some questions. What type of clothes should I take and how much money would be enough? Is this a kind of ""all inclusive"" holidays? Thank you in advance. Yours faithfully, Ursula Sobczak  [SEP]  Warsaw, 13 June 2000 Dear Kim, I think I told you about my plans of entering a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There was about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. Acctually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific. After the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule. We had to order taxis for them as they didn't have mobile telephones. However, they were very nice people. I didn't manage to meet Michael as I had expected, but apart from that, I really enjoyed  time I spent there. You should also try . Best wishes, Ursula. ",37.0
306," Dear Sir, I am writing with reference to an arrangement I made for your theatre show last week. I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't in the scene. Beside this, I had to wait three quarters of  hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was no nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available, so, it was an expensive evening! I know you will understand my frustration and that's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. However, she was a close friend and I couldn't accuse her of nothing else. I won't never forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth of my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to face it at that moment but... I bursted into teas as well as my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely step by step. I got conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell it to Pat. I still remember her words: ""Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed"". I do really trusted her when three days after I went to school and I could appreciate I was catching the eyes of everybody. I couldn't stand being watched and my furious led me straight to Pat. She tried to apologise but it wasn't enough for me. My best friend had let me down. From that moment, I denied being with anyone until I met Cold, a sensitive dog, the one who would keep my secrets forever and would be near me until the end. Sure! ",29.0
975," 13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested  me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach the Korean children in Brighton about Korean and Korean history in the early August. Secondly, I would like to stay at log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doen't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.  [SEP]  When you spend money on goods and services, it gives you satisfaction and happiness but going shopping is not always enjoyable. There are a few reasons. Firstly, you cannot always get the right one although you scour about all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired on your feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially, on the special occasion like on  sale. Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get  a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home. In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home. Sometimes, a moment comes up that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you. So you would spend more money  you have expected. To sum up, you should spend money as your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable. ",30.0
1161," Dear Mrs Maria Smith: I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for. the group has been booked into the Harris hotel. this hotel is very good placed. From there you can get a taxi, catch the  buses seven and eleven, wich both have you very close to the conference place, and also you can go by underground to get there. the conference starts at 5:30 pm and it finishes at 8:00PM. Then, after the Conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, wich starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM. this party is a formal one, so you should  be casual dressed. In this area you could visit the central park. It is very beautiful and a very good place to relax. Another place that would be interesting to visit is the old cathedral of the city. I hope these information could be useful for you. Yours Sincerelly  [SEP]  Hampton Court Palace Introduction: I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit. I went to Hampton Court last year, and I think it is a great place to visit. Location: Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court. In addition to that, I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty. transport: to get to Hampton Court palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo train station. From there depart the trains to Hampton Court. Moreover, I think  by train is the best way to get there, because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace. Price: there is a great price for children, students, adults and families. They are between three and six pounds each. Conclusion: Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see. And also it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it. ",24.00
387," Dear Manager I'm writing to complain about  poor administrations of your theatre. Because the advertisement for  show and the real show were completely different. First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on your advertisement but when I sat  my seat,  different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing for seeing them as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages. In addition, when I entered into the theatre I couldn't have  discount in spite of   student and I couldn't use in your restaurant either after the show. In that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. It's nonsense, wasn't it? Anyway, it was not ""My perfect Evening out"" but I think that it was a kind of ""contract infringement"" so I would like to ask for my money back. I look forward to hearing from you soon Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed our daily life? Of course, our life will be completely changed. However, we have to consider about our nature and human-being. First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now. All your stuffs will be performed by the computers. For example, if you watch ""The Star Trek"" - science fiction programme on TV, you will realise that you just can say ""Do it"" and then the computers will do it. However, there are some problems. If all your staffs are fulfilled by the computers, we might be idler than now. Moreover, we have to consider about our nature. As you know, even now, science and technology are destroying our environment, for example weird temperature etc. If we don't protect our environment, our daily life will not be convenient. Rather our daily life will be deteriorated. To sum up, future civilization is important for us. If there is no our good nature, our daily life will be unhappy. ",27.0
43," Dear Jane Clark Hello! My name is Yuna Kimber who attended this annual International Arts Festival. I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival to you. First of all, I appreicate you for organizing such an exciting festival.  It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself to this festival so much. By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries. And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt stuffy. I hope you'll get much bigger concerts hall next year. On the other hand,  plays and films were excellent. I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year. Finally, I'd like to mention  reasonably-priced weekend ticket.  It was brillient, because if I had to pay  all things each I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.  Thank you very much about that. I hope it will be helpful and useful for you. Bye for now Faithfully yours  [SEP]  Long time ago, there were two brothers, whose parents were dead.  Their parents were rich, so when they passed away they left a lot of money. By the way, the elder brother, Nolbu was a so greedy man. He didn't want to share the money with his brother, Hungbu so he took all of the money, and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything. Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family. But, even if he was so poor, he was so good and had a lot of affection about the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them. But, Nolbu always made people annoyed, and enjoyed other people's misfortune. One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer county during the winter.  He cured the bird to fly with love, and the bird was able to fly. The following year, when the bird returned  his house, he gave him a message.  It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid. Therefore, Hungbu became much richer than Nolbu, and he lived happily with the money helping the poor. People belive that the bird was sent by heaven. This story happened a long time ago. ",23.00
817," Dear Sir or Madam, I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all  paid  in advance. I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday. I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to the problems beyond my control. Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad. I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them. It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them. I came second  last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled  photography classes. In the camp I can practise them alot. I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency. Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another. But I finally got around  writing and you'll see that it's definetly worth waiting  as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you. As you know I'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A-level history, such as meeting up  my friends, visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own. However this term has been a far cry from the others. You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter. Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer  was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite. Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope. It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments. Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my  life write  me soon. Yours sincerely, ",35.0
532," Dear Mr Brown, I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I got rather disappointed. First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. What is quite not true because when I asked for it, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding ""no"". When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently from what the advertisement sign says, what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play. But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance  the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing from the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stamped on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"". So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and  given the reasons, I expect   to count with your sense of responsability, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds  spent on that terrible night. yours faithful,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? As we all know, technology had a gigantic improvement over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways. First of all, we all became much more sedentary than in the past. Most of the modern jobs involves computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and  Internet, a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk. Also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, what brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continous replacement of men by machines, the unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who lives in third world country. So, men have invented machines to help him on his tasks, but nowadays, we our becoming slaves of them. The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers since an early age, so that they could have a chance to compete with the furious emearrence in the future.

699," Dear Mr Ryan I have just received your letter and I am really delighted and thrilled to win the first prize in your competition. For the trip to California, I can only go in July, I am afraid, because my English course finishes in June and it starts again in August. In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or  log cabin, and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please. Because last time I was in a tent, I found it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I couldn't got to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent. I would like to take part in surfing and swimming please. Although I have never done surfing before, I am a quite advanced swimmer. Finally I would like to ask some questions. What is the weather like over there and what should I wear? How much money would I need? How big is the camp? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly  [SEP]  Shopping can be very exciting and fun. The feeling of buying new things is wonderful. But it might not be the same everytime. We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying things neccessary is fine I think. But buying things that  do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But after you never eat them and just bin them. I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you don't need or unplanned, might make you feel sad after sometime. ",37.0
21," Dear Ms Clark, I write you this letter because I want to tell you  my experiences of the festival. I have spent two days at the ""International Arts Festival"" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some details could be better the next time. For example, on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries. That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small offer; I hope it will be larger the next time. But do not worry! There have also taken place very good attractions like  dance shows, the art exhibition and listening to  talks  by writers, The reasonably-priced weekend ticket was a very good idea. This was a clever way to attract people's attention At last, I would like suggest a ""pony-ride"" for children, to attract families. Please tell my your opinion about this. Best regards  [SEP]  I think there are some possibilities for earning money. I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils, for example,  maths or english. There are also some schools which offer such a job. To teach pupils is not easy, of course. But I think that after some lessons the pupils will see that it is better if they sit down and learn their stuff. So it would be easier for the teacher ! It is also not a dirty work, I mean you do not have to clean rooms or toilets of other people! And you do not need to carry heavy things or have stress with customers if you are working in a shop. To be a good teacher you especially need patient and good nerves! Not everybody has the ability to understand everything at once. And the money you get is not less So, if you like to b with people and help them and if you have  talent to explain  good then it would be the best, if you offer your help to the people! ",25.00
118," Dear Sir, I would like to show you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage. As I had a whole week holiday I decided to spend it in London. At first I though I would just make a bit of sight-seeking all around the city. But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical show. No sooner had I seen  the starring actor  than I couldn't believe it. Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University. But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise. If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait stil quarter past eight in order to watch the show, instead of  beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement. Although I found the tickets's prize too much expensive I though that there would be some discounts available, but there were not. As a conclution of that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed. For all of these reasons I have to ask you for having  my money back. Sincerely: a disappointed user!  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. All began when I decided to take part in that school project. It consisted in having to memorisize a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam. Although this project could seem a very though work, I had to try it in order to rise my low global mark. One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet  exam on the top of his desk. Suddenly, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers on my notebook, I couldn't believe it, that would be the easiest exam I would had ever done. As I went out of the office I found walking down the corridor Pat, my best friend. As she was also making the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she hadn't to talk about that to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my class mates were in the front door of my house asking me if I had the solutions of the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret. In the exam day everybody anwered correctly to each question. And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were. It was the last time I trusted in Pat. ",30.0
412," 17/6/00 Dear Sir/Madam I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said  on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged  adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other actor  I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment for my whole family, infact all the viewers where very dissappointed. Anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be, I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes desparately searching for your restaurants our stomaches rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do you know, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems whatsoever. they even gave us a table number. What kind of an organasation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how dissappointed and angry I was that night. I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare. And I am demanding a refund. Thankyou for your time and attention Yours Sincerely.   [SEP]  The Revealed Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact he was one of the main busybodies of his neighborhood and his school so not alot of people in his school liked him. this was a vary bad thing about Pat's school and also for Pat. Another bad thing about this school was that there where different types of students that formed groups. Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously, maby just a bit too seriously, they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers of other gang, trying to start fights with them. This whent on and on, got more and more serious but it was so secret that  teachers didn't notice. One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very strictly to keep it a secret especially from the other groups. But Pat was so exited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. and the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was anoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it. exept a few phcyco groups, some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meannes of it. That night the party commenced. Everyone was enjoying themselves exept Pat who had heard about the raid. So he was thinking up an excuse to go home early. But no excuses where working. Everyone was drunk and they simply would not let him go. Time was ticking away. he new the attack was coming anyminute. now, The time had come the who groups had comdined their forces and where ready to strike. They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready. they started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone thew their balloon as far as they could. they all exploded with loud splashes. The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing back stones and shooting every one wit BB guns. Lots of People wher injured and even more where suspended the next day at school, when the Headmaster found out what had happened. Pat recieved no punishment at all and he wasn't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends. But he felt awfull because he new that all this had happened because of him. ",31.0
595," 18 June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I have just received it yesterday. I am very exciting. I would like to go to California in the U.S.A. in July. It is the only month that I can have my holiday in a year and it would be nice in the summer time. About the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin. It would be nice and safe for me than the tents. The activities I would like to choose the swimming and sailing. It could be fun for me because I like swimming and sailing could be exciting too. Lastly, I would like to know about the money and clothes. How about the weather in California in July? Is it hot or raining? Then I can prepare my clothes, or can we buy some clothes there? Are they accept the credit card or only cash. I don't want to take money with me. I would be greatful if you could send me the full details. Many thanks. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In the following paragraps I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages about shopping. Everyone needs to shopping everyday. It is  very important thing for our life. We need food, clothes, book etc. There are many kinds of thing for shopping and they are different for example the price, the quality In  suppermarket, shop, department store  have many things. We could buy mostly all we need in one store. It is very convenien. On the other hand, shopping is not always easy. Sometime, it's so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are  hurry while you are in the long queu. We have seen then,  shopping is very important for our life. Most people enjoy shopping because it  more convenien for today but if you found the busy place for shopping or it is not as good as you expect. It would not  enjoyable for you. ",21.0
1234," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writting to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conferents and other points in relation with . The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near of the college which the conference is into, five minutes walking. Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus. When you arrive to the Colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room. At the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks. There will be music as well for dancing. The director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice. About the afternoon before  leaving I have some suggestions. In the area of the Hotel there are two interesting places to visit. One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important Gallery where you can enjoy seeing differents kinds of paintings. I hope my information can help you and it has been useful for you. I am looking forwards to see you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There is an invention that I think that has been very important: the computer. The computer is very useful and It has affect our own lifes, in differents meanings. The computer has done easy a lot of works. For works that you needed, for example three hours you can do them in ten minutes; the same! But computers don't have affected only  in a good way because thank you to computers the number the places of work  for the persons is minor. But, definetely they has been a very important invention. The last relationed with computers is  internet. By  internet you can comunicate with people of differents places of the world at the same moment. And you can take lots of informations about a lot of things. Every thing that you need you can find it in  internet. Nowadays computer are very developmented and it is increasing. What will be the next? ",24.00
29," Dear Ms J. Clark, I am writing to you to thank  for  so good organisation of  International Arts Festival, where I'd spent two exellent days recently. I would like to inform you whed the idea was great and I hope that so needful for people events would become a good tradition in our country. I think that providing such festivals could help people to be in the centre of cultural life of the world and to have enough information about the new art styles But I hope that next year visitores of  festival would be able to introduce with more art groups from all over the world. I suggest it would be very intresting to meet artists from far and exotic countries. Also, if I were you I would make your concert halls a bit larger, because of too many people would like to spend their holidays with their families on your festival next year Event this year some halls, which I had visited were overcrowded and there were some problems with ventilation during some shows Finishing my letter, I hope what my notes could help you to make next-year festival more intersting and comfortable for  public Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Want to be independent? Earn   yourself. Everybody knows that common students are not the richest persons in the world. But then you are at the university you need money more, then anybody else want. It is so because you are young and need to make your life as intrestng as it can be now. All that discos, concerts,  touristic trips have to be paid  by a different sum of those small coloured pieces of paper, called money Of course, the easiest way to have them is to ask your parents for help, but a great number of young persons want to be independent. So thy need to get a job  that is very difficult when you haven't  any special education and experience yet. Most common way to earn  is baby-sitting. Many young people earn their pocket money so, helping neighbouring parents to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion of different goods or even  as a bouncer. Naturally, it's easier to get a job then you were good in foreign languagers or computers. When you can find yourself  as a tourist guide or as a secretary. Sometimes small groups of students organized their own small business. For example, they can design furniture or clothes, make web-sites and so on. In two words, if the young man want to earn a bit of money by his own hands, the luck and success will find him ",26.00
772," 13 June, 2000 Dear Helen. I've been thrilled eversince I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently. In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choice that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen along with some questions. Firstly, I wish to travel on July as I already have plans for June which is to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacations commences. Secondly, to the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much. Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing. I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort. However, as this will be my first time to go surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners. Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would lie to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of  amount of money I will have spend in the camp. I am looking forward in being received in camp California. Thank you in advance. Yours sincerely, Regina Kong   [SEP]  13 June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hi Kim. How are you? I am fine and so is my family. I was glad to receive your letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could. I thin it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band having their concert. At first, they asked me to decorate the stage since I like drawing, but as I wanted to get more involved, they said that I could also help them set up the lights, the microphones and the instruments. I have to admit that it wasn't always easy, but my effort was worth every penny. The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well. I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together. I'm not sure of what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too. If you have any questions, please write to me. I wish you the best of luck and hope you have fun helping the singers as much as I did Lots and lots of kisses, Regina ",37.0
83," Ireland, 16 December 2000 Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November. I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to. However, I feel that it could be even better next year. Firstly, according to your advertisement, the 'Stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries. I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that ""our"" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented. In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music. I really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so! Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to. However, I think a weekend is really too short. May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Magda, Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some  school and home rules in my country, France. First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me. Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean  the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them. At home  is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay  very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noise""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere. Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon. With lots of love, ",34.00
108," Santiago, June 17th, 200 Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I am very dissapointed with your musical show. I recently went to London on vacation, with some friends. We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was. If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one by the way. When our final day arrived, we went shoping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show. When we arrived, the were a lot of people, the pace was beatiful, all seemed perfect. When we entrance the place our problems begun. First, there were no discount on the tickets but that was fine. Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour, we deal with that too. After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us realy angry. But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed. I hope that you understand that I want my money back, or at least some of it, because this weren't my ""perfect evening out""  [SEP]  How has moden technology changed my daily life? I think that technology have change my life and everybodies life in many ways. Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, ofice or any place you can be in a city. This technology has help to made my life easier and more exciting, but like everithing   had some negative thing. This technology has help in many fields, like medicine, entreteinment, work and other thing, so it has obviusly change the life of many people. The bad things that this could have are unimportan, in comperison with all the good things this have done, so let's don't focus on the negative aspects of it. I think technology has become a part of our lifes, so we have to learn how to live in this new world, that is changing as fast as computers change. This is a new era, an era for a new tipe of people, the feuta people ",32.0
477," Dear manager My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same since last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well  this musical. Then I was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start  that lasted forever and  was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I meant to go to the restaurant which occasionally was closed. By the time I thought: ""I want my money back."" That was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen.

Despite the fact that she was my best friend I could never count on her or she would tell everybody in high school all my secrets. Once, when we first met I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time  we found out  a very good friendship on our conversation. One day she came over to my house and we spoke all night about our lives. Then I told her about my first kiss (it was terrible, the guy didn't know how to do it) and things like that. The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience in kissing. People would be starring at me and laughing. I got really mad at her, but nowadays we are friends, not as close as we used to . I don't tell her my secrets anymore. ",23.0
487," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to make a complaint about the show 'Over the Rainbow'. During my stay in London I went to your theatre to see this show. As it is said in your advertisement, the show is starring Danny Brook but there was  different actor . It is not the only problem. The show had to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. You promised that there will be discounts, but when I came, I found out, that they were not available. I wanted to go to your restaurant. I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we will go there. And what I found out. Your restaurant was closed. You promised that if we go to your show we will have a perfect evening. Everything was just vice versa. I am very disappointed, that is why I am asking you for compensation. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. It happened at the end of  school year. My class was going to a night disco and I wanted to go there too. I asked my parents if I could go, but they did not let me do that. I tried to persuade them, told that nothing will happen to me, promised to do all  housework. But all they have done is told me that I am to young for it and I can go there only when I am 20 years old. I had such a desire to go to the disco, that I decided to go even without  parent's permission. I told my secret to my best friend Pat. But she told it to very kid in school, even the teachers heard it. It occured that one of the teachers told my parents about it. At the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks. I understood that I must keep my secrets and do not tell anybody, even the best friend. ",28.0
1025," Dear Mr Robertson! Thank you very much for  good programme! We like it very much! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is on Tuesday. We think, that you also would like to go there, when you'll know about it better. There will be showed the latest fashions. Also, we will see leisure and sports wear. We know, that you wanted to have another  and didn't know which one. If we go to the show, we will see many hairstyles. Maybe it'll help you choose. Also, you'll be glad to know, that for students it is free! So, we think, that it is very good as for you as for us. So, we can change your programme a little bit to the best one. On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written on your programme. On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the national art gallery, but after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon. Our class asks you to think about this programme. We're sure, that you like it very much!  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. My best friend told me, she met one boy. She liked him very much. She was speaking about him every time. She told me, that he was hansom, kind,  well-understanding (he understood her from a half of the word); the main  was he also liked her very much! I belived everything she has told me. And said just to be careful. But in three days she hasn't been at home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait. But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something. In three days of her disappearing the phone has rung. I took the phone. Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must take 5000$ and bring them up to the street. I took any papers, put them to one bag and without saying anything went to my friend to take something  like  gun. The friend gave me his toy  and I gone to the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man, that I had a gun and money. I  surprised that he belived me. Of course, it was better for us. I gave him the bag took the friends hand and we run away. After that she told me, that the man was the boy, which she met. Don't believe everyone! Better check, if you are not sure! ",23.00

On one hand I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could go to this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams of september. If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out. On the other hand I think I would rather not sleep in a tent because I had a bad experience once and I would like to try log cabins. although it wouldn't be a problem if I finally have to sleep in a tent. Another point is that I have already chose two activities that you asked me while I am at the camp and  are basketball and golf, they are the best  for me because I think I am good at both and I used to play them before. Finally I want to find out about if  is any supermarket near the camping and if there are any facilities in washing my clotches into the camp. I look forward to reciving a reply from you.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I had the most exciting experience in my life, as you know I was helping at the pop concert and it was amazing! The concert was in the University in the middle of the field and at the begining when we arrived there weren't many people, only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound  and of course us who had the job of serving drinks during the concert. We arrived quite soon because we had to organise how we went to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in  appropiate place. I was very nervous because I'd never been in a concert before and an hour before everything stated the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't avoid it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't belive it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began feeling more comfortable and when the concert started everything was such exciting that the time ran very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream. Well I think I'm going to remember it all my life and I'm sure that if you had been there you would have enjoyed  very much. See you soon. Best wishes. ",26.0
1159," Dear Mrs. Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to give you the information you requested. We are holding the conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel - banqueting room at 2.00 pm on Sat. 24 June. The nearest tube station is Lancaster Gate.

I look forward to see you and your group soon. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]  To: The group leader From: Re: The Barbican Centre. As you requested which is the interesting building to visit. I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city. It located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station. The Barbican Centre built in 1975. Apart from Banks and important offices. There are also  world stock market exchange, an opera theatre, shopping arcades,  books and records stores. It also held an internation exhibition all year round. Recently, the exhibition of africa just finished. The opening time starts from 7.30 AM. till late at night when the theatre is closed.

You and your group will visit one building which has so many places in this building. So that you can spend your time in one go. ",25.00
1095," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing, on behalf of an advanced class, to you to thank you for having organised our a three-day programme on 13th to 15th March. We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to an advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to know up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students. After consideration, we would like you to reorganise the 2nd day programme. We are politely asking you. It would be grateful if you can reorganise this matter at your earliest convenience. I look forward to meeting you to discuss this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Hide and Seek! Nowaday, a lot of celebrities, such as pop, film and sports stars, suffer from being intruded on the privacy of their lives. Undoubtedly, their the first enemies are ""Journalists"". Some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories. Because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives. Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved. On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely  intrusion on the privacy. What is more, they insist that before celebrities, they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched. In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of covering celebrities. Taking everything  account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and be in celebrities' shoes.  ",33.00
103," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your entertainment which was advertised in the last edition of ""Plays"". I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I suspected to meet. First of all, the prices weren't lower in any cases although you advertised the information like that. Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes. Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors. Especially I was disappointed by Danny Brook who made me nervous with his lack of talent. According to your advertisement, there was a possibility to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed. After that, I should also mention, that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life. I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my lost money at once. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Come back to paradise There is no doubt that fashion affects people and makes them obsessed with this subject, but what can be designed more? Can you imagine the trend which will be as shocking as it has never been? The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays it's getting obvious that designers sold only details, but significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past,  only the fabrics are different. People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there won't be any problem with being up-do-date. As it was previously stated I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important  will be  body and  purity of our soul. ",32.0
76," Dear Mrs. Jane X, I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been . First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think  should be bigger for jazz, rock or still classical concerts. Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year events, such as : - Funny plays and films to spend the break time; - Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night, - Art exbitions to know  more things about  artist's lifestyle; and - talks by writers to say how good is his latest book. In addictions, the ticket's price is too expensive and  difficult to buy another one every day, so, I think  is more effective if  was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. In conclusion, I hope  will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before. Sincerely  [SEP]  How are you? It was nice to receive  notices about you. I remember these time in our class when us talking many time about rules and I am missing that time so much. Well, about rules in my contry,  is not different than another countries. The rules must be respect for all people if you don't want get out from scholl. You must to be organise, clean and respect the right of other people.. ",12.00
1241," Dear Mrs Smith, I'm writing in response to the letter we have received from you, in order to let you know all the information you have asked for. First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, Main-Road 21, which is situated not far from our college. I'd suggest you to walk, it will only take you about seven minutes. Just follow Main-Road until  to reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road. The college is a huge, yellow building - you can't miss it. Secondly, you have required information about the end-of-conference party. It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight. All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well. The location of the party isn't fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival. There is no need putting on special clothes for the party, casual ones should do it as well, for we want everyone to feel comfortable. Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you to visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested) Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need. I'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone, a blessing. Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it. Take me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say ""Sorry, I must cancel our meeting"", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it? Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on. Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so. So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention. ",40.00
107," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to you to complaint about the problem that happened in the play called ""Over the rainbow"", and for this reason I would like to get some money back. The problem is that most part of the advertistment had mistakes. First of all, there were not discount on  tickets' price, and it was advertised. Secondly, the play was advertised  at 19.30, but it started at 20:15. Despite of this fact, that I did not care about it at the beginning, when the play started I did not see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor, I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook. Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it. But the main reason of my complaint, is that in the advertistment  said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not. Therefore for all things I would be happy to get some money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life The technology has affected so much my daily life. If I had not it, I could not do most part of the things that I do today. First of all, if I had not it, I would not be able to move out of my city because I would not have  car. But we have it, and the thing that have changed more my life has been the internet. Nowadays with my computer, I can travel everywhere in the world, just with it connected with a modem. internet have changed my life because with it, we can do everything at home. For example if someday I forgot the book, with the internet I can find the book inside it, and more information . Another thing apart from the internet and the car that has changed my life is the TV. With the TV I can know all the information at the moment, moreover I can see films throw it. And the best thing is that it entertaints me alone or with people. In conclusion I think that without the technology we could not live as good as we live know, and our lives would be so much boring. ",21.0
1149," Chêne-Bourg, Tuesday 12th June. Dear Mrs Smith, it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown's illness, and  hope to see him soon in an excellent health. Nevertheless, I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting. We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel. Furthermore, since it is located between the airport and our location, a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room. The end-of-conference party is to be held at the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness. Therefore, all  guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted. As for the three hours of free time, I strongly suggest you to check-in your lugages at the airport and then, after a five-minutes bus ride, spend your time in the marvellous 'Old City'. Best Regards,  [SEP]  My fair Mobile Phone. The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last  years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is, of course, the mobile phone. It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities. Trades, politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs. However, the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student. It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as e uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations... Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday's courses. Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone, but his parents'! ",26.00

Well, I start to make a plan for my travel, and the only time I have is on July because I will be finish my course of language at St Jame's School. About accomodation I would prefer  cabins, because I suffer  alergic, and I think  tend, would be not very suitable for my health. I am very happy to have the opportunity to do some sports. I'm very good in swimming and surfing. Swiming I won last summer competition in the school, although I'm not very good at surfing I like , and I always practis in my holidays every year. I would like to know if  is necesary for me to bring some money, or if we will have time to visit the City, about the clothes  I have to bring some winter clothes?

I was asked to put in order all the chair for the singer, this was only in the begining, after that I need to control all the microfons. However I was not very sure in this I enjoy. After that all the singer arrived and I was in charche to greeting them and give them something to drink. You  immagine how existing I was specially because I always wanted some photograph with them and this was  special moment and I realice I didn't bring my camera I was very sad.

1211," Dear Mrs. Smith, I am writing in reply to your letter about the internation student conference. The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car. It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total  members of your group are 4 and  taxi fare would not be expensive. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel. Regarding the end-of-conference party on Thursday, it starts at 7 p.m. in the garden of the college. You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy-dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign. On Friday afternoon, it has set to be a free time. Therefore, you can go shopping in the town centre which is near the college. Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there. The other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy. Moreover, it is the biggest flower market in this area. I look forward to meeting you soon and hope you have a safe journey. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Invented Light There are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight, moonlight, candle light. Some of them are natural whereas the others are not. Owing to  increasing demand of light for more activities, the natural source is not adequate. There, electric light has invented. Nowadays, the electric light has been becoming part of our lives, especially during the night. Whatever we do at night, we need the electric light. Have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light? It must have been a big impact on industry, agriculture and our lifestyle. Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit. Do you feel uncomfortable? Could you do anything much without light? In addition, the electric light is the manuscript of other electric equipments and they has become an important part of our life, too. I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for comforting our lifestyle. ",30.00
668," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply to your letter. I'm very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition. Here there are the informations you require. First of all, I'm available for travel only in July because in August I'm going to attend a language course in France. As far as accomodation is concerned I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable, and, therefore, I have never stayed in a tent. The two activities I have chosen are basketball and tennis. I play basketball very well, although I have never taken part in important competitions; however, I am not very good at tennis, and I would like to improve it. Moreover I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money I have to take, and which clothes are better to be put on during the holiday. Yours sincerely Rita Pizzi  [SEP]  This report shows which lessons and activities are better to be filmed in order to make a short video about daily life at our school. It is based on interviews taken from over 80% of my classmates. First of all, according to the majority of them, latin and greek lessons should be filmed. In fact they find it difficult to take them in and, in their opinion, these lessons are the most important so as to show their daily life at school. On the other hand, about 3% of students suggest that also chemistry lessons should be filmed, because they often take place in the laboratory that the school has lately built; in fact some experiments might be filmed. Furthermore, some students would like to film the football school team, because football is the most practised activity by the students. To sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern their sportif activities as well. ",34.0
326," Dear Mr Smith, I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her, after work, a very good evening with your musical show: ""Over the Rainbow"". I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show! What a surprise! Your advertisement was a quite lie and I have to tell you  my disappointment. Every point were wrong. (I wondered if it was a fake!) At first, from your advert  Danny Brook (who is a very good singer I appreciate very much)  was not here. An unknown man was singing, not in tone - awful for my ears - (poor Tina Truelove! such a professional singer with a beginner!) At second, to go on with the beginning, your show started not at 19.30 but nearly one hour later (20.15 to be more precise!) And for the third point, I would hope to offer a good diner to my friend because I knew your restaurant as a famous place but I was still disappointed. It was closed for some improvements! I hope you will understand  my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money. I join  this letter my two tickets. I am looking forward to hearing from you Best wishes  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets! Poor of I, I thought it was nice to have a friend and to be able to share lots of things! I was very young when this story happened but though it was a child's adventure I remember it yet. I was just thirteen years old! I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I got a very creative imagination. To make to profit my ideas my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country. Like my heros I would like to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree. The highest tree near a river I have ever seen. Peaceful place and wonderful view. With my friend Pat (I put him in the confidence) I started to work and my idea became real. It was our fortress and every day we could improve it. The tree was our ship and the river the sea. We could play  hours and hours without seeing an adult or  other children from the village. I prefered it. It was our secret Pat and I. Child's secret. But Pat could not keep it too long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told an other friend our story. What a catestrophee! All  children went from the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry against Pat. Our quietness disappeared and very fast everybody wanted to command my ship. A desaster! There was lots of fights between us and we were naughty like child could be with other child. The result was my ship was destroyed and never more I could trust in any friend! ",23.0

First of all I would like to travel on July because I will I have finished my exams by the end of June. I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month. Secondly I would prefer to be accommodate in  log cabins. When I was a child I was affraid of all these little insects that they live in the ground and this fear still remain till now. I also think that the log cabin will be much more confortable than the tent. asketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen. I play basketball since I was twelve years old and I am  member of the basketball school team for four years. In swimming I had won the first price of a local competition. Finaly I would like to ask you for some further informations about the clothes and the money we will need. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you already know, last month I was helping at a pop concert. It was a very excited experience and I really enjoyed  very much. I didn't have to do something very difficult. I was only responsable for the property of the back stages. But if anyone was been asking for some help I was always there. The most exciting  about this experience was to meet all these well-known people. I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them, but the truth is that they are men like us. They have a very simple life and behavior when they weren't on the scene If I have the opportunity next month I really want to go back. I will definitely apply for a place. Love Kelly. ",25.0
68," 16.12.2000y Dear Ms Clark, I am writing to you in connection with the advertisement in  newspaper. I would like to express a couple of thoughts that I have after the festival that I have recently seen. I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festivel, connected with art and culture. Especially the date was very suitable for me, as I have a lot of free time. What is more there was a wide vareiety of music Although the artists were supposed to be from all counties, there were only six nationalities. I hope that next year there will be much more possibilities to enjoy films or plays and that the halls will be bigger, as they were overcrowded. However I was really suprised that the entrence fee was so low. I have also one suggestion, if I may. Maybe next year the festival could be ended with  fireworks show. Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advices would occur useful. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Tom, Just I got your letter and sat  straight away to write  you a few sentences that will illustrate my opinion. To begin with, I'd like to show you how are my obligations at school. Although we have to change our boots, we don't need to wear special uniforms. Our clothes should be in a good taste. We are also allowed to have jewellery and a make-up, what's especially crucial for girls. When it goes to my home, I think I have  usual duties I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. However my parents aren't demanding, I have to be home at  least at 11 o'clock and tell them where I go out. In my opinion there's nothing special that I'd like to change,  maybe only this, that I wouldn't have to change my boots. I hope that it'll claryfy your questions and doubts. So, that will be everything as for now. I'm looking foreward to hearing from you. Yours ",26.00
305," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the terrible evening I spent in your theatre. Just to remind you of which show I am talking about, it is called ""Over the Rainbow"". There were  couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made  fool of my self by arriving late and  all those people starring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board, it said that they are available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day. The evening that I spent there was terrible so please may I have my money back. Yours faithfully, Raulet.  [SEP]  Well, for instance people in Roman times (Roman soldiers) didn't have any sort of transport to move them from one place to another. The only way they could move was  their feet. They could walk over 4 km per day without any breaks. But people in nowadays like me can't even walk 1 km. And also what is the point of walking when you have cars and buses or even bikes. Phones also affected my daily routine. If I wanted to find one of my friends, I had to run around our hood finding him but now, I just have to phone  on his mobile phone and just ask him where he is. Computers changed my daily routine because when I was younger, I was spending most of my days outside playing basketball but now, I just play on the computers all day. E-mails are also one of my examples. When e-mails didn't exist, I was writing letters and it took longer to get to the person I am writing to but with e-mails, the person could receive my message within  few seconds and you don't have to count in how many days  he will receive it. So in my opinion, modern technology changed my daily routine quiet a lot. ",30.0

I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a plesent evening. From the beggining it was all a disappointment. When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card, but that was not posible. I let this pass and I bought it anyway, thinking that  was posible that it was only a mistake in your advertisement. But the play started fourty-five minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan an who was the mainly reason of why I decided to see the play, was changed for another actor, how turned out to be really bad. You will understand how upseting all this was, and I decided to visit your restaurant, thinking that could save my visit to the theatre, but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel felling mad an hungry. I think you realized why I'm writting this letter to ask you to give  my money back. All the thing that were promised in your advertisement were not true, and it was definitly NOT the perfect evening out. Specting that you will solve this misunderstanding.  [SEP]  There's no doubt that modern tecnology has changed our lives, but how? I think that some of the changes had been very good, like the impruvement to the medical science, that now can saved millions of persons that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives. It has changed the ways in how people comunicate. First the telegraph and the radio an now TV, the telephone and the Internet allowed people be in contact with others really quickly and distances arent now so difficult of overcome. But tecnology had not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us thing that can make our lives more confortable, it had also  thing that arent bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world. The weapons and the factories are destroing our planet and we need to realized that we have to use tecnology to impruve our lives, but always triying to respect nature. ",26.0

The journalists follow the famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take fotos and  other information about them. After that  journalist sell their information in the newspaper and magazines in order to earn money. I thin that it is very dangerous because the famous peple cannot have you private life and on the other hand they may suffer from deppresion and sadness which may be lead them to suicide. I think that the goverment have to protect them and their private life from the journalist,  punishing them. I think that the government I responsible for the private life of the people.

First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my travel-holiday only on July. Secondly, I'd like to prefer to stay in tents, that would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California. It could be very enjoyable. And I would like to choose  my activities Golf and painting. I used to play Golf several years  and I like to paint the composition. Last, I have no experience in  abroad. Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California on July. Which clothes should I take? May be there are some occasions which I have to pay  myself. As above mentioned, please take care to give me more information, and if you'd like to know more, please telephone me for further discussion. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Yuna ARNISTON  [SEP]  Seoul is the capital city of Korea. It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million. I went to school there for twelve years. Many people are saying: ""When you have a son, send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance at the best opportunity. There are all kinds of facilities what you can imagine. Most of the people, they like to go to  centre of  City that's Meong-Dong where is the uderground acade and several businesses have their head quarter there. There are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where I can taste my favorite foods. That doesn't cost much. If I go to visit my family in Korea, I usually walk along the Meong-Dong streets, and am enjoying to have eye-shopping. But there are alwalys a lot of traffic at all times, and the air is so polluted that I can't even breathe. I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfrendly people who are too busy. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Yuna ARNISTON ",17.0
973," Cracow 8430 Dear Competition Organiser, I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've planned already the rest of my summer holidays. On June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there. An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins. I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but I can't have it in  tent. I've also choosed two activities, swimming and sailing. These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water, but I like them more than surfing. At the end I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp.  Please answer me soon. Otto Zajac.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers, what is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much of time and health. Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there. In these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets  than at shops or even shopping areas, because shopping at  shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money. ",25.0
909," Dear, Helen Thank you for the letter. I was very please when I knew that I had won the first prize. I would like to go there only in July, please. Because I have a holiday in July. For accommodation I would rather prefer log cabins because it's more comfortable than tents. And I don't have to worry about the weather. For two activities,  the first one can I have Tennis, please. Because I'm very good with tennis. I used to play a lot when I was a student. The second one can I have Photography, please. Because this's my hobby. And my dad just bought me a new camera. So this's will be my first chance that I can use it. Can you tell me what sort of clothes do I need to bring, please. I'm not sure about the weather in California in the daytime and in the nightime. And  any idea of how much money do I need to bring. Thank you very much for your offerring. I hope to hear back from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hi, Kim Thanks for the letter asking about a pop concert. It was really good. I'm glad I went. My responsibilities are selling the tickets and making sure that everything is right. It was good to work with a lot of people and shared experiences. I met a lot of famous pop bands for the first time. I would feel sad if I didn't go there. They gave me a concert printed T-shirt. I'll show you by photographs. From that time I had a lot of friends also some of them are old friends from college. So we are still keep in touch. And  next concert we were promised we'll be there again. I wish you were there with us. Because sometimes you wouldn't have known the experience until you had done it. Any way I will sent you some photographs. I hope to hear back from you. Take care and don't work too hard. Please send my love to your family. Best wishes ",25.0
527," Dear Sir or Madam, Last month I went to the theatre with my husband to see OVER THE RAINBOW. I'm sorry, but I had a very unpleasant evening. First of all, the play started 45 minutes later. I felt so angry about that. And discounts were not available (nobody explained the reason ). Secondly, the actor wasn't Danny Brook. I wanted to see him! He is a good actor but I saw a very bad one. And we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Such a bad night! I'm sure you will complain the reasons why I want my money back. If you couldn't do that, we will accept  to go to another play. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And Lorca knew it. But Pat was in the wrong place in the incorrect hour. That's a story of a crime of passion. Let me explain it. In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city (a small town near Savannah). Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her. But she was in love with a black man, called Jim. And Pat, the maid, saw them in the river. She couldn't keep the secret and told everything to another maid. In  few hours everyone knew it. Pour lovers! When Jim's wife knew it she caught a gun and killed her husband. Then, she cried and cried holding him. (If she hadn't do it, Lorca's father would had made the same). It was a shock for Lorca. She jumped into the river and killed herself two days after. Pat and Jim's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives. How could they forget it? ",33.0
835," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California. I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so it is the only month in which I can travel. I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height, I am so tall that I could never stand up. I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July. I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf. I have never practised this sport, so I can't play golf at all. Would you mind sending me some information about the kind of clothes I will need? I would like to know how much money you suggest to bring. I would be grateful to receive some information about the meals at the camp and I hope that it will not be a problem for you if I am a vegan. I am looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Elena Pabori  [SEP]  I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day, we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm. Only  who gets good marks can take part in theese activities, so sport activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because  Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone.... In my opinion we should film  science lesson, so that our teacher, listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense! ",36.0
271," Mr John Smythe, I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it will. First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall. Second of all, the play was suposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. I'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it. Another thing I want to complain about, is that your advertised that discounts were available, but there wasn't any discount at all. To finish my ""marvelous"" evening, I wanted to eat at your restaurant, but it was closed and no reason was given. As I didn't have a ""perfect evening out"", I think I have the right to ask for my money back. I hope you understand. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Pat's story Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now you've probably asking yourself what does it mean, well, now I'm going to explain it to you. Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look, Never have I seen such a deep look: and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer, in other words, hack  the school software. I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do. Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the ""crime"" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests. I was punished, nearly expelt, but Pat didn't receive any punishment. I never accused her of lying, and I you ask me why, I really don't know. ",34.0
769," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter regarding my prize that I won in your competition. It was a very pleasant surprise to win a trip to California and I very much appreciate it. I am writing this as a reply for you request to provide you with some information about my preferencies. First off all I'll prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free. I'll have to pass several exams in June, in August my family going to visit our relatives in Austria. I am not so keen about  accomotation but would rather stay in tents than cabins. It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and a company of your friends. It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I am really enjoying swimming. We live near the sea shore and swimming is the sport activitie I am really good in. Far the best swimmer in my school. The other subject is photography. I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more then just good. Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be better to take with me, what I'll need at Camp? How much money should I take, will it be any guided tours? And how many will be in  Camp in July? Hope to hear from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. My best friend is crazy about shopping. She will prefer shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant  spending of time, when you going from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Somitimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a sense of living. And it's so many people like her. Lots of families planing a day out to go to a shopping center, and it is a normal routine for them - to spent the all day just shopping. Not so many people thinking about going fishing or playing sport games with their families any more. They forgot how beautiful could be the countryside, and only tourists you can meet in the castles or museums. People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied. People are not smiling to each other, not talking to each other at the shops. They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy. In my opinion shopping is just  to cover our basic needs. Shops are not for spending our lifes in them. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends going to play something together. It feels much more better. You'll have happy memories and  a good mood. ",27.0
898," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I have just received a letter from you and I am really happy to hear the news that I have won first prize in the competition. I would like to tell you something about what you asked me in the letter. Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except  July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin. I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for  few days but not over 3 days. It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin. Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography. I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year. On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college. Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money. Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cram, sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer. Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Shin Parade  [SEP]  Do you think shopping is always enjoyable? Well, it might be true but I think it depends on the situation. When you do shopping, you can see various products  even very extraordinary thing. You can also see more graceful and fine thing. You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you. On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want. Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing. If  shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping. In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even varys with  people whom you shop with. ",31.0

1109," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you about the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially  the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an advertisment for ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go and see it. First of all, you might not know what this show is . In fact, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be interesting for us to see all that ""live"", rather than on TV. Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget. The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the Science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move  to the show. It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while. We all hope you will be able to find a good solution without causing too much trouble. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Terror in the Alps It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. We had been trapped in the snowy, almost vertical slopes of the ""Tête Blanche"" for more than ten hours by then. We were there, alone, my friend with his broken leg and myself. We had decided to climb that more than 3'700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped! I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which we were able to call a helicopter. We were safe! ",38.00
737," Dear Helen Ryan: I am writing to give you the information it was ask in the letter you had sent me. Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be  the second week of July because I will be very busy in any other date for reasons of work. Secondly I would prefer sleeping in  log cabins because I  fell much more comfortable. One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems in my back. Finally, the two activities I would like to do while I am camping are Singing and Basketball. The first one because I think I am good at it and also I love singing loudly with other people. The last one I have never tried it but I think I can do it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier. I would like to know if I must take some money and what kind of clothes I will need. I look forward to hearing from you. your sincerily  [SEP]  Dear Kim: I'm very sorry I haven't written  you for such a long time but I had to make a travel to my parents house because my mother was operated on; don't worry she is all right now. Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing. It was a wonderful experience but at the same time I had to work very hard. The things I did were: Prepearing and controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc. The most exciting thing was talking with the band, asking questions to them and of course listening  the music and enjoying the incredible show. It was the most exciting experience I've ever had in my life. Best wishes. ",29.0
834," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs/Ms Helen Ryan, I would like to thank you for the prize I won. My name is Manuel P. Martinez and I won the first prize in your competition. I have been informed that all accommodation and travel cost are paid for  the company. I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month. I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in  tents, because I find it more confortable to sleep in  beds, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in  tents. I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before, that means I do not have any experience on the subject. Please let me know the kind of clothes we will be wearing, would I need to take a suit? Are there going to be any formal parties? It is important for me to know if we need  money and in that case, how much money would you recommend me to take? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Manuel P. Martinez  [SEP]  June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set  the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes ",37.0
717," Dear Helen: I have just received your letter, and I am very happy about this. Thanks very much! I think I would like to travel only on July because I've just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holidays in these days. It will be very nice for me. Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place, I think I will choose log cabins, it's sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to tents next time (maybe next year.) When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music, seem like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum liked me singing this song. And I can also make very good photography, because I learned  this in China two years ago. Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about  journey, What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? and how much does it cost per night live in a Hotel? Thanks for your help. Yours  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me too. But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable. Firstly, I am a student, I don't have  job, so, I have to asked  money from my parents. I can't asked  too much that's very bad for my parents. When I go shopping. I alway feel shame because I spend my parents money. (although I got  part-time job, it  just enough to pay my rent.) Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things  always expensive. You should spend more money on buying clothes and food,  you will  very happy when you buy it, but, when you come back home  take out you purse, you must be feel sad, you purse  nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money.) Sometimes, when you shopping on the street, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy it once,  you will feel very sad maybe. And then, you may save money for the things you like, nothing to do, just for the poor things what you like so funny isn't it? Another thing is when you shopping in a busy street, seem like oxford st in London. a lot of thief  there, they will steal you money, that's so dangerous. So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me. It will stop when I get a good job. Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it. ",23.0
552," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter letting me know that I've won first prize in your competition. It came as a nice surprise. I would like to let you know that I can only travel in July because that is the only time I can take leave from work. I would prefer to stay in the log cabins as I would be afraid of insects or any crawling animals if I have to stay in the tent. For activities choices, I would like to choose Tennis and swimming. I used to play Tennis at tournament level and now I play it for enjoyment instead. Swimming is my best way of excercise and keeping fit. I've a few questions to ask. Since all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, Are there any other expenses that I have to pay? How much money I should have with me in order to cover all other expenses? Furthermore, what type of clothes I should bring? I would be grateful if you could let me know the above information as soon as possible. Thank you once again for giving me  good news! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I find shopping is the most time consuming. If I want to buy a nice pair of shoe, I'll have to go into a city centre and browse around from shops to shops until I find the shoes I like. If I'm not lucky enough to find one, then I'll have to take a train trip to a larger shopping places such as London. Whilst in London; I'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere. To walk around London streets looking for a pair of shoe can definitely be a tiring task. As I'm a compulsive buyer, I'd probably ended up buying other things as well. At the end of the day, I would not only be carrying  pile of shopping bags but also trying to squeeze in between other passengers on the train on my way home. By the time I get home, I would be completely exhausted. As you can see, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",33.0
210," 17-6-00 Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to complain about the musical show: Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June. I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out. I could not understand why but  still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished. At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning. I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement. I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having such kind of mum. I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologise for thousands of times. A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did . However, they are equal important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said with a loud voice. 'If there were no cleaner, who would clean the school for us, who would keep the environment nice and tidy.' Suddenly, all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All the jobs have the same importance.'

159," Dear Sir/Madam, Having seen your musical show last Sunday, I am writing to complain  the problems and to ask for some money back. Firstly, concerning  actors, in your advertisement you stated that DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE would perform in the musical, but in fact different actors performed. I was so disappointed!! Regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant, to see the musical I had to wait about 45 minuits because it started at 20:15. As well as this, after seeing the musical I went to the theatre restaurant, which you referred  in your advertisement, but it was closed already. I was really angry! Lastly, with reference to ticket prices, your theatre hadn't any discounts even for children. I had to buy an adult ticket for my child and spent more money than I had expected. I am sure you can imagine what I felt. It was not  perfect evening for me and my child at all! I am also sure you can refund my money. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Kwa Phat Sun.  [SEP]  Dear Tae, How are you getting on? I'm fine. Having talked with you a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to give you some information. I know you are always interested in detictive stories especially Agatha Christie's. Don't be surprised! Her best detective stories are going to be read on the radio this Sunday evening at 18:00. I'm sure you'll be pleased. You are supposed to listen to them. As well as this, the stories are going to be read in English. It's  good chance for you to improve your English. You can not only listen to her best detective stories, but also learn English automatically. It will be fantastic! Where the stories are concerned, they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and  naraitors are going to read clearly. What I'd like to say is you should listen to them. I hope you're happy to receive my letter and am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, Kwa Phat Sun ",31.0
715," Dear Helene Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am glad to know that I have won first prize in your competition. Now, I am writing to you to ask  some details about these two weeks at Camp California and giving  some answers to your questions. First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am in holidays. About the accommodation, I would prefer staying in  tents as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club for five years and earned a few competitions. Secondly, I am very interesting in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time each other. We had a lot of fun during our last holidays and we took a lot of pictures. As the instructions about clothes and money were not enclosed in your letter, I request about it and ask you to include in it. Thank you very much, I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  A lot of people like doing shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes  is not always enjoyable. And nowadays people must do shopping either they like it or not. For people who used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and  they are always looking for fashioned-clothes. But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like  the sales period, I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring. In my opinion, I think people have to do shopping even though they don't appreciate it very much. If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people. And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety. ",28.0
55," Dear Ms Jane Clark, I am writing to you to tell you that I enjoyed the International Arts Festival held on 21-22 November this year. I liked the plays and the films most. Some films were really wonderful. You had picked up unknown but talented directors' films and they were really worth watching. And the concerts were also excellent. Especially, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore. However, I found some things which I think I should point out. Some concert halls were not big enough to have the audience. For next year, I think you should take this matter into consideration, And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films. I will definitely go to the festival next year, too. To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could welcome my comments on it. Best regards.  [SEP]  A Japanese folk story ""a bamboo princess"" There was an old married couple. They had no children. One day, the lady went to a river to wash  clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees. In a bamboo forest, he found a shining  bamboo. When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it. She was named  bamboo princess. The princess grew up  beautifully. Some princes proposed  her. But she said to them, ""if you want me, you have to do this."" and asked them to do impossible things because she didn't want to get married. One day, the old couple saw the princess crying. When they asked her , she said ""I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon"". They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her. But, one the day, the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her. This story happened a long time ago. ",29.00
1171," To: Mrs. Smith Thank you for your letter, which arrived on  second. June. I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College, which will hold at  Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days. please find  information your required as follows: We have booked the hotel for the group. Called ""palace Hotel"" which is about 10 miles away from our College, the hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on  19th of June and then take the group to  Conference and return to  hotel every day. Regarding to the end-of-conference party. We have planed a barbecue at 5 oo pm. on our most idyllic play field which is over looking the endless Countryside and farms. At 7:00pm. we can move to our student hall to have a disc dance until 10:00pm. On the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel, then we all set up to have a sightseeing  Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for  airport. Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London. There are many historical buildings remain. I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing . If any further discussion, please let me know. Yours. sincerely,  [SEP]  How wonderful ""light"" We need light every day, not just  night time. We need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time. How is the wonderful life after  invention the  light. Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light. When I was small, we lived in country yard, I remembered, we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time, it was very little light on, and  many things we couldn't do under the  oil lamps because the light range was very small. There was no any light outside our house,  no light on the road or field either. I was always very scared whenever or wherever . because most places. Covered by dark, dark and dark. This scaring dark is still affecting my life now. I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family. What a biggest person on the earth, who invented the light, Einstein was. He created another day time after sunset, people use it to do anything they want to do, We believe we can't live without light today, specially in  city life, we have a long time to spend for the activities after  Sun going to bed. Which we definately need light to keep on. I dare to say, without light, our life will go into a dark, dark hell. ",29.00
139," Mr Soren: Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad. I would never expected that I could be so decepted. This is not the firt time I have been in your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure ""Over the rainbow"" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of the most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have demostrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or shoudn't be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourites singers, whose career I have been following since the begining, and  never appear, and nobody give any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one can do instead. Even listening some music to help us take it easy would had been better than nothing! None an announcement, not an invitation...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment  that point. That terrible place definitively needed a renewal. Well, this is not my idea of a perfect evening out, as you can realise. Each time I see the advertising I get mad. Of course, you shoud make a refund of the money , not only to me but to all the public. But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least till you continue as its manager. Expecting your news,  [SEP]  It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kind of accesories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, like always, just some weeks. All  in fashion pass away in a couple of months and has to be created again. Fashion is a part of our lives, even for those who will never reconize it. Have you notice that all the classic gentlemen wear  same tipe of suit? And what about this kind of intellectual and progressive people, don't they wear all the same model of ugly but confortable shoes? I am sure that fashion will survive for ages, even it will change to become easier to use and clean, because we all need to feel a part of our society, comunicate our way of living and thinking, be part of a group and, at the same time be different. The future will bring to us new concepts, adapted to our lives. ",24.0
522," Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London for a holiday, I went to the Circle Theatre to see OVER THE RAINBOW in the evening. That made me feel disappointed. First of all, the actor was different from  your advertisement. I meant he was not Danny Brook. Secondly, it took times to wait about forty five minutes, because it started at 20:15. It should be on time at 19:30. Then it had no discounts, which the advertisement said so. Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount from your ticket  with  ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant was early closed. As soon as the show ended, I went to there for having a dessert. Lastly, I don't think that it was my perfect evening. I would like to get my money back. I look forward to replying from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Griffin, who is a teacher, wasn't surprised at our preparation. It was so close to be on his birthday, so we made a decision to hold a small party for him. She has just learnt with us for three weeks. She is not talkative,  kind, and reserved. However,  this party she took part in, she was responsible for preparing food. As far as we knew, she's good at cooking. While she was choosing vegetables in a market, she came across him. When he asked her 'why do you choose deliberately?', she answered without thinking. That caused the secret  disclosed. We didn't blame her, because we knew that she didn't intend to do like that. Although he wasn't surprised, he was glad and pleased with our party. Anyway, Happy Birthday to Griffin, again. ",23.0
122," Mr. Circle Theatre's Manager I am writing to you complaining for the Play you are advertising as the ""London's Newest and Best Musical Show"" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience in my whole life. I cannot bear  when somebody says something and then does just the opposit way. To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says . What is more it lasted 45 minutes of waiting  to start and  did not supply all the expectations people had. On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all. Instead of him there was another actor who  neither act nor sing, and, even though, it was a Musical Show. The last thing I would like to complain for is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed because, as it said, of ""VACATIONS"". If in the advertisements and leaflets says ""VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW"" there are not reasons for  being closed. It should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place. It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there, or not. To make it shorter, because of everything I have said before, the correct thing to do for me is to ask for my money back, and for you  is just giving it back to me because of all the troubles and disappointings feeling you made me suffer. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.  [SEP]  HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY LIFES In times of our grandparents life was so different, that we cannot beleive that this huge change to our day life happened in only one hundred years or less. First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication, traveling and geting information. You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time  it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the ""enter"" key in a computer. Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every  machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly. One the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because  is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has. With advantages and disadvantages, technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others. Things and technology changes every day our life, our jobs, our way of face the world, this is what differences both centuries, our grandparents' changes lasted to long to change human life. ",23.0
701," June, 13th 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in response to your letter which said that I won the first prize in the competition. As I didn't expect to be successful, I am very happy about this result. I would now like to answer the information you requested. Firstly, I would be pleased if I could travel in July as I already booked this month as a holiday at work. Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience  to sleep in the middle of the nature. I am especially glad about the activities offers, in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sport teacher. I have been playing Basketball for many years but I would appreciate to improve my skills, in particular the ball-handling. Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly await having the possibility to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect in  crawl. I know I have already asked a lot but there is one more thing I need to know which kind of clothes will be appropriate and how much money will I approximately need? I trust I mentioned all the requested details and am now looking forward to hearing from you to arrange the exact date of departure. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  June, 13th 2000 Dear Kim, how are you doing? Thanks for your latest letter - I was really happy about your news! Here, everything is as usual: School, studying, eating, sleeping - but did I tell you about my latest job? I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer group and you can't imagine how exciting it was! First of all, I helped selling tickets and drinks and there I realized how bad my maths is - I took such a long time to give back the change! But at the end I handled it almost automatically. Before the performance I introduced the spectators to their seats and then a instructor showed me how to lead the spotlights. I really had butterflies in my stomach when I was responsible for the lightening! It was marvellous! But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers back stage! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography. What do you reckon? I can hardly await your reply! Lot's of Love, ",36.0
1036," Dear Mr. Robertson, We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme related to it. It is  really good programme,  especially visiting  Science Museum and  National Art Gallery would be  great opportunity to learn about art and   latest improvements in science. However, my classmates and I saw the advertisement with regarding the London fashion and leisure show, which is enclosed, and want to take this opportunity to visit it, if you allow us. It takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March. It will be  great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, new hairstyles and make up industry. Although according to your programme, we will be visiting  Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon, we would like to make a suggestion which can help us to be able to stick to both. Would it be possible to visit  Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon,  instead of it to go to the London fashion and leisure show, because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours. Thanking  in advance, we very much hope that you will give your attention to our requirement. We look forward to hearing from you relating to this matter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  One of the most important subject of the media is to inform people bout famous people such as politicians, films stars or successful musicians. In order to fullfill their readers' requirements they always follow them. This kind of people are known as paparazzi. it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not, they just try to find the best pose. After taking their pictures in the way that these famous people would not allow them, they sell the pictures and make a fortune without asking their permission. This is the most argueing point. Do they have to ask for their permission or not. However, if they would ask, obviously they can not take the kind of pictures, which show them naked or when they are having  shower. May be they  have to pay for this kind of pictures. On the other hand, famous people have  point, if they do not allow  paparazzis to take their pictures. Because, althoug they are famous they have also their private life. Unless they do not want to share it, it must be acceptable for us. I think the best example would be Lady Diana. It was said that while they were trying escape from  paparazzis they had that accident, which caused of their lives. This can not be the way in finding information for the readers. ",37.00
366," Dear Sir/Madam The Circle Theatre manager I am writing to complain about your product. I would like you to back my money because that was not same as your advertisement. I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement. In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time, price discount and equipment. DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actor so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my apointment on that day at 18=30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me. However, when I went to the theatre, you didn't anything not only discount but also apporogize  us for  dalay of starting  musical. In addition  different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner about the musical because the restrant had been closed. It made me so dissapoint and angry. You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He always tried to say nothing and did. But everyone always noticed he had  secrets from his face. Whenever he has  secrets, his nose moves quickly. He had not liked this habit and had thought it was wrost of him until he solved a big crime. When all  money had gone from a bank, nobady  there except Pat. Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him. So. Pat didn't say anything. But his nose moved quickly when  police showed  a picture of  bank robbers. Then  police realized who were bank robbers and arested them. Although  bank robbers complained to Pat, he said nothing to anybody. He just moved his nose!! Thanks to his habit, he is still alive and all  money were backed to the bank. The town became peace again. ",19.0
580," Camp California in the U.S.A. Competition Organiser 13th June 2000 DEAR Helen Ryan, I am really happy for receive your congratulations. Was  very exciting moment and  very nice competition. And now to be the first winner. Is wonderful for me to have the opportunitie to visit the Camp California in the U.S.A. In answer at your letter. I would like to travel in July for two reason one's is because I totaly will finish my exam in that date and the other   in the first two week  I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and will be there the delegation from my country. And for the second question. About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp I would prefer  log cabins; because maybe  is more interesting to share with other people. In other hand you ask me I have the chance for to choose two activities while I am at the camp. but  is no easy, because all is very interesting for me. But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for practice climbing and surfing. Meanwhile, these activities are develop. Can you said me if  is necessary to bring  special clothes, I refer for instance if I practice surfing  I need  water suit. Is  possible to get  there? At the same situation for climbing  I need  special equipment and then there are  available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities?  I need  extra money? I am really appreciate  if you can answer me these doubt and saying again. Thanks very much, because is new stimulation for me. this prize. Yours sincerely, Isabel Cruz  [SEP]  13th June, 2000 Shopping is not always enjoyable. I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view, because we can studie the  reaction before, during and after to shopping. People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary. We must to accept that  media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V. For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes, cosmetic, accesories, jewels etc. And the other  they choose sometimes just for the label. Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area, because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they  shopping they choose pre-prepared food. We know  is more easy for these  busy life. In the other hand the facilities for access to  mall center is not good. The area for parking, space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate. Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable. I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment. which is special place in the town we  lefet just for  comerical area, but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket, and mall centre in different areas of the city.

1071," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am representing an English class, which is going on a three-day London tour. We would like to thank you for organising our programme. We really appreciate your attention. The programme you suggest is versatile and full of interesting activities. We are eager to attend  National Art Gallery and Science Museum. But we would like to make our suggestion, if you don't mind. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would like to go to this exciting show. It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday on the 14th of March from 10 a.m. to 19 p.m. Our students will have a great opportunity of seeing the latest fashion, as this unique show is held only once a year. What's more, new hairstyles and leisure and sports wear are presented there. And apart from it, this activity is free of charge. We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon. We are thinking here particularly of the fact, that we can go to the show, instead of shopping. We sincerely hope that you will consider our suggestion. Faithfully yours,  [SEP]  We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebreties can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, what makes their life miserable. The first point I would like to make is that a private life of a celebrity is open to  public. I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is wildely discussed in the mass-media. It is common knowledge, that such an attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family. Another aspect is that  children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention. They can't communicate with ordinary children and attend ordinary schools. And last, but not least is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, show their real feelings to  public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering into their lives. I would like to sum up by saying that every person, either famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed. ",31.00
458," Dear Sir, I've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical, starting from the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets. There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30. And I am asking you: Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience? I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back, please I hope you will reply to my letter. Regards XX  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life. We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages. The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature. And  not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone. In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology  is a benefit for you. If you don't  is going to destroy you. ",33.0
654," Dear Mrs Ryan I'm writing concerning your letter about my win in your competition for two weeks at Camp California. I'm very happy to be the winner from your competition. Because I'm working in an accountant office, I'm very busy. The only month I could go to holidays is July, when we haven't got a lot to do. Moreover, because of the accommodation, I would like to be in a tent, because I want to spend my holidays different than usually. And in my opinion, when you live in a tent, you have more from the nature and the adventure. I like a lot from your list for the sport possibilities, however I will choose swimming. I used to be a member in a swimming club for about 10 years. Additionally I'm keen on taking pictures. But until now I only took pictures on holidays and  some family celabrations. Lastly, I would like to ask if I have to take a lot of money with me, for example for the food. And also if the weather will be good at this time . I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I would like to begin this composition by saying that, not for everyone is shopping the same. For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a ""must"". In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare. On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone. To sum up, I would like to say that for to have an exciting shopping , you have sometimes to plan it or just be in the right mood. ",32.0

Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Family life in our days is very important because both of parents work and they haven't any time for  children. In addition childrens have so much lessons at school that they doesn't have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are in home. In spide  that fact there are of course many families especialy in small towns which eat lunch all together and they they solve their problem all together. Parents play with  children and have fun. And the difference in that  children is effectivily when they grown up and want to make a family they do the same with their parents and make a happy family. Besides that the most importand  is that this children have an easy teenaties and they haven't go pshycological problems and they are useful in sociaty. To sum up family life is the most important think for childrens phycological wold which help them in their education, job and their married in future. So we also try to make our time creative when we are with our children. ",22.0

No matter that people started worred more about polution in the world. Let me to tell you, how  invention of  motorcycle has affected my life. I love motocycles and I don't think I could live without them. I drive  motocycle since I was 16 year old. Me and my brother we used to go to the rock concerts. We have met a lot of people there same mad about motorcycle as we were. We were avenging races and trips. We were driving motocycles  few day befour we finally had got to  mitting points. I really enjoy driving  motocycle. People say that  is dangerous, I don't think so. When I drive  is only me and my motocycle. Before me and after are my friends that I like and trust. And around me  nature that I can watch and enjoy while we shop fore  camp. We can go to any place we like, avoid traffic and to full buses, trains, etc. I am really greatful for  people who invented the first motocycle in the world. I feel very bad about  that I don't know who was it. On the other hand no matter that I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life end  people I care about,  has affected my life in a very best way. ",21.00
490," 17/6/2000 Saturday  Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to inform you about my disappointing evening  I spent at the play ""Over The Rainbow"" presented by The Circle Theatre. The problems started at the beginning. Although it was written 19.30 in the advertisement, the play began at 20.15. In addition, a different actor was starring instead of Danny Brooks and this was the most disappointing thing that evening for me and my friends. I was told  to be able to get discounts, however, I could not get any. I also went to your theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. As a result, I could not have my perfect evening out. For all the reasons I have mentioned above, I would like to get at least half of my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  17/6/2000 SECRETS' DAMAGE Unfortunately, Pam wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and this made her lose her friends, her job and everything she had. From the time she began the university, the problems began. She was telling  secrets of her friends to the others. One day, her friends got fed up with this and ended their friendship. Pam was sorry but there was nothing she could do about this. Then she began to work at a company. One day, she again told the secret formula or a production to a friend of hers. Unfortunately, this friend told this to some other people and when it was understood that Pam was guilty, she was fired. Life and harder than anytime for Pam then. She had no friends. Nobody wanted to talk to her either. One day, she moved to a farm and nobody has heard from her since then. ",28.0
1134," Dear Mr. Robertson. I and all of my college have read your programme, which you organised for us, for our three days trip to London. We all think the programme is organised well, especially we're so keen on the idea  to go to the National Art Gallery, to see  work of the bigest painters on the world. I'm writing to you, because we saw a great advetisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show. The show will be in  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday,  14th of March between 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm. I think it's a great opportunity because, we will have a chance to se the latest fashion, leisure and sport wear, and as well the way to do the perfect make up and hairstyl. In my opinion, we can have a great time there, and entrence is free of charge for students, what is very important as well. I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go on that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to  next day. I hope you'll think about our proposition and consider to change the programme. Your faithfully  [SEP]  'My perfect holiday' 'It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it' My story began on my holiday. It was  nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine have decided to go for holiday this year to the see side. We thought  with that beutiful weather the seeside is just perfect for relax, sunbathing and joy. However the truth was a little bit diffrent. The things started happening from the first day we arrived. The weather had changed suttendly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and  rain. Despide of that we were still thinking optimisticly. We were thinking is so many other activites to relax and enjoy ourself then sunbathing on the beach. We went to  few Exhibitions, night clubs,  restaurants around  area and we really had a fun. In the end, the weather got better, so we decided to go to the beach. Everything was showing, today was going to be a good, sunny day. We went for swimming. Then again in a few minutes the weather changed and  strong storm begun. The sky went completly black, so at first it was difficult to see, where everybody is. I look around and I relised one friend of mine is still in the see, and fighting with  storm, trying to get to the side. I didn't think just went  to save my friend. Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunetly  ended good. That was the end of our holiday, and next year for sure we won't be going to the see side. ",25.00
1218," 12.06.2001 Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter of asking for my help to the conference. I would like to help you with my best. Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked into for the group accomodation and I spoke with the hotel manager for traveling to the conference. The hotel has their own buses, they will pick us from  hotel to the conference saloon. Secondly, I would like to tell  more about  end-of-conference party. I booked  Palace Hotel's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students. It is going to be very lovely and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for  students. In addition, I suggest that they should wear sporty and comfortable clothes. Finally, you would like to know  some activities for three hours  free time. I think you can go to the 'Dreamland'. In this place there is video games, some little competitions and  small zoo available. Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way of the airport. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  To: American students group leader From: ... Re: Information on an interesting building to visit Introduction Here is my report for American students who want information on an interesting building to visit in Ankara. I would like to describe 'Anitkabir' Findings 1. This building's name is 'Anitkabir' and it is the biggest building in Ankara. It built in 1953. It is placed in the middle of the forest. There is different kind of bird and different kind of trees present. 2. It has  very big museum inside the building and all  building made from stone. 3. This building's security guards are very special soldiers. Their aim is to protect the building from the enemies because there is also  very big army museum available. 4. It has no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to seeing Ankara from the hill. It opens at 8.00 am to 5.00 pm Recommendations I recommend that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it includes all Turkish history and very good sight seeing. ",25.00
712," Dear Mrs Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won, I have been really very impressed. Unfortunately I became your letter with two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July. In fact I will finish my university's exams only on the first  July and after the 20th  is impossible because I am going to do four weeks volontary  in India for UNICEF. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabins, because, in spite of my love for nature, I am terribly allergic to pollins. So  stay in a log cabins will probably evite me a lot of problems. Choose two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing,  sport in which I have many years of experience, and surfing despite I really have any experience. Unfortunately I had ever been in the US so I have any idea about how much money I will probably need and about what kind of clothes I have to take with me. Thank you very much for your attencion on my regard Your sincerely  [SEP]  If you ask at twenty womans what is their favorite hobbies probably the most of them will answer ""shopping"". But why is shopping so popular and loved by so many people all over the world? Why so many people have been contaged by this ""psychologic virus""? The verb ""have"" is probably the most used and loved by the human species. We are always trying to have more things, that in spite of care after us family, us future, or other things which are probably more important than a new perfum. Always more people, everywhere, are becoming shopping-addicts. Maybe you can think I am excessive but recent studies prouves that this mania can be really dangerous. Certenly the only fact of have something can helps people to be more sure of himself. In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein model for a certain kind of people you are cool, but it is really so important? Probably when Oscar Wilde said: ""Superficiality is the suprem vice"" he was right. We still look at what people look like and not at what they really are. ",29.0

Here I will answear all the questions that you ask me, and I will ask you  other things that you dind't mention. I'll like to organize my trip in July because  is when I have vacations, also because  is summer time in  U.S.A, about acomodation at Camp I'll prefer  tents, because it's a new expirence for me and I'll like to sleep in  tents to have a great time at my new adventure. In my free time I like to play golf and swim, so I think that I'm good  playing golf. I play every saturday and Sunday  after that, I usually go to the pool because I love swimming, I think that those  sports I will like to practice at the Camp. Helen I will like to ask you how many money we have to take to the Camp? What kind of cloth  we have take? Thank you very much for your colaboration.  sincerely Teresa Reina  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of the time when we go to the shopping Center we have a lot of fun, we go to stores to see  cloth, we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries, but not all the time shopping is enjoyable. Sometimes when we go shopping with someone who is not a good company, we usually don't have a great time, or when we know what we want to buy, but when we get to the store they don't have what we want, in that moment we neat to shop also when is an important day like Father's day or christmas every where we want to go and buy something  is very crowd so we can't find what we are looking for with calm because everybody is pushing you to the other place that you want to go In that cases is when we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center.

1156," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to reply to your letter and to give answers to your questions. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, a five star hotel, which offers many facilities. It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The students can get there with the No 35 bus. They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station. The hotel is opposite the station. At the end-of-conference the college, in which the conference will be held, gives a party for all the students. It will be offered light food, like sandwiches, pommes frites, chips, sweets and different drinks - no alcohol. There will be life music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves. It would be better to wear casual clothes, because they are more comfortable and are liked by students. On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to. The group can also visit the zoo, the opera or stay and relax at the college's enormous garden and enjoy the settings. Do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information. I am looking forward to seeing you.

833," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply  your letter saying that I have won the competition, which I can't believe. I am so excited by the news. I think I can take this opportunity in July because I run my shop all year round except three weeks in July. I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable thought it may be a new experience. It would be nice to have a chance to try  new sport when we are relaxed. I'd like to try golf because I'm not good at any other sports. Besides golf, taking wonderful photographs of sceneries has been my dream, even though I am a beginner. I'd like to ask about what clothes we need, what the weather is like and whether we need some spending money or not. I'm looking forward to going on this fantastic holiday. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I know you have been waiting for my letter. But as you know, I have been so busy that I couldn't write earlier. Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much. My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try  whole new experience of helping at a pop concert. I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't. I've really enjoyed this opportunity. We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers. We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing. The most difficult work was to arrange  coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from  countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most from this experience? I've found pop music so wonderful, it changed my idea of that classic music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too. Love ",34.0
1113," Dear Mr Robertson, I would like first, in the name of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London. We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to, is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them! ... well actually we've must received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance is free for the students so that won't raise the cost for the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were to go shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind! I hope you will take account of our request, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it. George was about to be linched on account of his colour skin.

He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner. No one was garding him. They were all celebrating their victory with a gorgeous dinner around the fire place. I tiptoed as far as the house, carefully opened the door, and headed to George. At the very moment when he say me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope.

According to the advertisement you gave, there  have been some important differents . Firstly, the play started almost an hour late, and I went there to see Danny Brook, but there was a different actor on stage. Secondly, in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays. In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there. I would be grateful if you  do it. Finally, I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers. If you do it, there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them. I look fordwad to hearing from you Your sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology change my daily life? Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have. It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it. In this case we are going to focus on me. Emilio Almodar, 18 years old, University Student, and the career I have choosen is  Internacional Commerce or Market. I use technology every moment but I did not realise. For example, when I come back home from university and I call my friends, I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and  fax  and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that. We also have five computer, the latest versions of them, because they are useful for my father to work  and for me to do some special works for University. This machines are connected to  Internet, and it gives to my family too much facility to get  every  information we want, from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday's football match. In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in  U.S.A. It's really amazing. Apart from this, I don't spent my free time in technology. I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends, because technology is not all  life, but it is only a little part of it. ",25.0

In  advertisment  starring was very interested - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I desided to go to your theatre but at the beginning  was the tranbles. In  advertisment  was - ""discounts available"". I'm  teacher and in Polan I have discounts but in England no, I know this is other country. I was disappointed because you wrote about it! Otherwise, the musical show started too late at 20 15 not 17 30! This was a waste of time. I was very suppresed when I saw  different actor, it wasn't Danny Brook. This musical show wasn't ""the best"". I went out earlier but the theatre restaurant was closed. I had  very disappointing evening. I would ask you for  money back. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  ""Fashion of the Future"" What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This is  very interesting question for us and maybe very important too. We think and speak about it in our families. I saw one week ago on TV (the 23th annual) the fashion show in Paris and I was very surrprised because of this style. All  models had a very strange long shoes made from black skin, the trouses was quite short and the jackets was elegant with blazzend materiell. I think the fashion of the future will be very different but suitable for all people. The people will wear clothes  from natural materials like silk,  comfortable and elgant. The colours will be  very good quality and the fashion will be changed very quickly like now. Because the world is now a global village the people will wear at least one part of traditional or national clothes (for example  peasnt jacket or hat) like  now in rural areas from time to time.

You have had some questions which I would like to answer now: - Time of travelling: According to the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July. Due to this fact I hope you can arrange it for me. - Accomodation:  Log cabins would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California. You now that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as it will be then in California. I suppose I will have more fun if there is a cabin which is air conditioned. If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me , too. - Activities: During my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. On the other side I have no experience in surfing, - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation. - Additional question: Could you tell me how much extra money is usually needed for a two week camping ? I am looking forward to getting further information from you. Greetings from Germany! Yours sincerely Bruno Aachen  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about. 'Shopping' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about luxuary goods. In this contest, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look at it as a duty. But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy you will go shopping with much more consiousness and  joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look at it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour of shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internet and use e-business and online-shopping to order your pants for example. This is even an appropriate way to get around  unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home after you have ordered them by e-mail! Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop. You have been presented  some causes why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it. It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a 'smart' shopper. ",38.0

I must say though, I would have to travel on July because it's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friend if it is possible. Log cabines will be  ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at . Climbing would be my second option,  for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times. I would like to know how much money do people ussually take and how many clothes. Sincerely Yours  [SEP]  13 July Dear Kim: Well, you want to know what I did in the concert? Help.. I know it sound extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprise it turned out to be much more fun that expected. About 20 people were helping apart from me, we had some kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert. Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert. It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs! It was so fun, that I enjoyed it a lot.

I will join in  the swimming group and the photography group. Both of them are my hobbies, I have won some prizes in my school competition of them. Therefore, I am quite confident about them. I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accomodation because I have had all  holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before. I would like to try it this time. As all the travel expenses are paid already, I would appreciate it if you could tell  what kind of clothing  also how much pocket money I need. I look forward to hearing from you in due course. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, The concert I helped  last week was the greatest experience I've ever had. I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage. You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the hi-fi system on the left side (it should be on the other side). Before  opening, the pop star found the mistake, otherwise it would be a disaster. The performer, Paul, is a big music name at the present. But I'd never met him before. This time, I saw him in person. I told him I loved his songs, he was very happy. Then, we stroke a lovely conversation. Afterwards, he gave  his pen for my enthusiasm. Anyway, how are you? Write soon, tell me how you're getting on in your new job. Best wishes, ",33.0

I do not have words to express how happy I am, I would like to thanks you and Camp California for this oportunity. Hoping to hear soon from you. Raul Pedro Ybarra S  [SEP]  Since the man become man he has had the need of hunting for sourvive, in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the wemon's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff. Nowadays in the year 2000 we still practice this ancient art but in a diferent way, we don't use weapons for hunting animal in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more we go shopping. This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have develop such an instinc for shopping that we can proudly say, that we are some sort of kings in the urban jungle. If an activity has stay with us, the mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price mark on it, that is the greatest  extasis. But where is the bad poet of it, well shopping can became horrible in christmast for example when houndred of people goes to the shopping center and it also can take many problems when you become an impulsive buyer. Any ways shopping is with us and it will stay with us for a long time. ",26.0
713," Dear Helen Ryan i was so happy when i knew that i won first prize in your competition. i'm hope that it will be  good gift for me from your organization. You asked me when i  like to travel? i  like to travel. only in July because in august i must go to my grandmother and help to her to gather a harvest of fruits. i'd prefer take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting spend nights in the tent. and with the tent i can go to enougher place of the camp. But when it is going to rain it is not comfortable, but I like it. i'm want to do such activities likes basketball. Because i think it is  teenagers game. and i'm like painting because i like to paint the nature, sea, moutains. i'm often go to an exhibitions of paintings of modern artists. But i like different stiles of art. i'd think I'll enjoy this travel. i whant to know some questions about it. Can i say more then two weeks if i like it? In what day i can start my travel? in what conditions it will be spend? and the last one. How much money i should take there? i'm realy lookind forward for your answers. and i hope to see you soon. Bye yours sencerely Gubin.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. i'm absolutly agree with it. Because i have my own expirience of shopping. For exsample resently i was shopping at the market, which located in the center of our town. end what do you think? When i was there i saw  very beatiful T-shirt. i asked my mother to buy it. But my mother said: ""i haven't enough money to buy it"". i was abset of it. Our goverment  very burocrative. Our ministers  very criminal they are often breake the law, stole money. for example Paul Kozin had stole 800000000 dollars. Because of it our stare can't pay money to workers of schools, hospetols, builders. in our country  high nomber  unemploeers. Usual people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for money to enougher people. my parents can't buy me all what i want our society our full. each man think only about himself. quality of life  very low. But i hope that i will be  time when each person can buy to himself everything that he or she want. and shoppings will be allways enjoyable.  ",17.0
722," I'm pleaseant to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA. As I'm an artist student in a particular College, I only can go to your Camp California in July, because in this month I got no  class, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like  log cabins as my accomodation, because it's safer and cleaner than  tents and I wouldn't share it to anyone. Painting and Photography are the activities good for me. They fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas. In Painting I talk about human beings in this world, in big canvases; and in Photography, with Collages, I talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines. So in Camp California I would like to keep me on touching to these areas. I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records. In summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks to not forget my artistic life.  [SEP]  Shopping is something made, which do not need to be enjoyable. We can analize when shopping is enjoyable,  when it is not. There is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves. It means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based in our relationship to another people, in the work or in the family. So we have enjoyable when we buy what we like following another people's views. On the other hand, sickness in ourselves  our relatives made us unhappy to buy. It is an obligation shopping  medicines, clothes to winter, doctor visites, and so forth. A death in the family is not also an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is the highest point of the sickness. Buying coffins and graveyards to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes. In summarizing shopping can be enjoyable or not depending of our healthy state. Giving examples:  we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves;  we are sick, or our relatives , we buy medicines  we  not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation. ",23.0
1209," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I will try my best to answer the questions. First of all, we have already booked the Five-Stars Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenent to come from the airport. You can take both by buses or taxies. The nember 101 bus starts from the airport, than you can get off from  ""city college"" stop. It would be a great chance to tark part in the party for everyone. This is just a relaxing party, just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better to wear a dress. Finally, about the free three hours, my personal prefer  to go shopping. Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England, there gathers so many shops. It  worthes tp spend time and money on that. I look forward to seeing you! Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowdays people have become used to watching televesion's programs everyday. The TV is so important that you can see it in every family, and it is a essential equipment for everyone. First of al, in my opinion, TV has a great education functions, and  also makes the world become small. You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment. I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on  radio because the news on TV are vivid. Moreover, the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone. I would like to open  TV when I stay at home. Someone are talking, laughting, crying on there, so join them, you will feel much better than just yourself. Some TV programs are enjouable! However, TV also has some disadvantages. You might just sitting in front of  TV for hours learn nothing, or no more talk with your family. I think this is the badest influence in the society. In clucsion, the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages, but on the whole  advantages is greater than  disadvantages. So, but on the whole, TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world. ",19.00
363," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, the actors who starring was not Dany Brook as it was advertised but one other actor, whose performance was very bad. That made the show disappointing. Secondly, the show should began at half past seven. despite these fact the show began at a quarter to eight. Also, there was not available tickets  and after these bad musical show the restaurant of the theatre was closed. My evening was not very pleasant as you advertised. As a result of that I demand to have some of my money back. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  If I say that technology has not changed my life I would be lying. If fact technology change in a major point my life. Can you imagine your life without a car or a television? I don't. Technology  so much  my life which I could not live without it. But technology doesn't only makes my life better. By the use of  car I do not only get an easy way to move , but I  destroy my enviroment. Also, if I use the car, in small distances when I can go on foot, I destroy my physical situation. Could you imagine your life without a television or a computer? I could not. Althouth with the computer I can contact with my friends and with the television I relax, I could not find another way to relax and contact with others. Technology is very important for my life. It makes my life more easier, and it would be much more difficult to live without it ",22.0
260," Dear sir or Madam, I was one of your customers who had a very disappointing about Over the Rainbow show at your Circle Theatre yesterday. First of all, these starrings of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. The only one reason I bought your ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove, as your advertisement had shown. But your starrings were not . I bought a ticket for the 19.30 round and the show was very very late. It started at 20:15 and that waisted my time and made me feel bad about your service. And also the ticket discounts were not available. That was not your advertisement had shown. And finally, your restaurant was not available after the show. From every singular things I have complained, it was totally different from what your advertisment said. And because of this, I would like to ask for my money back. If you see that this is a good reason, please telephone me. My telephone number is 123-4567. Yours  [SEP]  Thesedays we are living on a high-technology world. Modern technology has been growing rapidly and it has effected me a lot. Indeed, I have to save more money for upgrading my personal computer. Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumes like me and you definitely have to pay our money to keep our personal computer up to date and able to work with  new computer softwares that require more and more performance of computer hardware. Anyway, modern technology such as the Internet changes me a great deal of life-style. Using the internet, I can search for almost all  information I want to know. And I can send e-mail to my friends via the Internet fastly and cheaply prepared to the old-style mail-services. Finally, I think modern technology makes me do my business faster, smarter  with much more efficiency. ",25.0
357," Dear director of the Circle Theater! Last week I was in London. On Friday we, my friend and I visited your Theater to see 'Over the rainbow'. It should has been my best evening that week, unfortunatly it wasn't. The first thing that happen was that the show didn't start on time. Instead of 730 am as your advertisment said, it started  815 am. In the meantime we tried to get our money back to do something else, but that was impossible. When the show started Danny Brook was not acting, witch was a great dissapointment for us both. We are both big faan of him When the show was finished we went to the resturant to have something to eat. But then it was cloesed because of reparations. Due to all this troubel I think we should have our money back. We both have £15 tickets. And to an other time, make soure that your advertisment is correkt! Yours Mrs Anna Schulsson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was my best friend for several years as a child. But I haven't seen her since we were 10 years old. When were nine years old and were in thired grade we had a 'House' where we used to play all afternones. In fact it wasn't a realy house, it was some stones between the trees in the littel forest neear our house. But we used to call it 'Our House'. It was a secret place and we had promissed each other not to tell anybody about it. Useally we were cooking flower-soup, and talking secrets. One day when I were there alone, I heard some other kids aproting, I sat down behind one of the stones so they shoulden't see me. One minute later, Pat and half our classe stod in 'the House' looking and laufing at me and my flower soup. Maby she did it to get friends. But in fact that day she had loosed my friendship. ",23.0
1064," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing in behalf of my class- maid about the programme you had organised for us. We all want to thank you for having choose such good places in London. We are especially excited about the river trip to greenwich which will be in the first day. I would particularly like to talk about the second day. We really liked the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for  London fashion and leisure show that will happen on tuesday and we are very interested in go. As you know our class are composed by girls and it would be very exciting for us if we can have a look on the latest fashions, make up and so on. Although we would like to visit the science museum, we can leave it to the next opportunity, what we suggested to do is intead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure show and keep the afternoon programme the same. We hope you accept this change for good. We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Last summer I went to  amazon on an expedition with other 10 people, such as a guide, a doctor, a scientist & all the rest  as me were just curious. We walked all day and took rest in the evenings. We were not allowed to leave out tents during the night or until the day start, because of the dangerous animals which leave there. But for me it was the most exciting moment. One can be really amazed by the view. One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without  seen and started walking towards the river, because I want take some photographs of the sun rise. The view took my breath of when suddenly something took my breath . It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as  she was very hungry. I knew I could not do any moviment for my safety but I did and for my surprise It run away. ",31.00
368," Dear sir or Madam, I have recently had a week's holiday in London and, during my stay, I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow', which was shown at your theatre. At first, the advertisement said that there were discounts availables, but when I went to buy the tickets there were not any discounts. As if this was not enough, the show, instead of starting at half past seven as the advertisement said, started at a quarter past eight and one of the main actors, who was supposed to be Danny Brook, was someone else. On top of everyting, the restaurant which was announced in the advertisement was closed because it was being arranged. You can imagine how dissappointed I felt after that evening, and I am writing to ask you for a further return of part of the money. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot in this things. In music, before  having a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I just can record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds. In graphic design, before  having a computer I just could draw, but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel, develop ideas more easily, or take photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them. But, in other things, I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of living too much: I do more or less the same as I did some years ago: I get up in the morning, go to school, have lunch, study and go out with my friends without being afected by microchips or nuclear energy.

1061," Dear Mr Robertson I'm writing to you to complain about  three days programme. Thank you very much for your good programme,  especially for  visiting  The National Art Gallery. All our class like to see the beautiful pictures which were drawn by brilliant artists and painters. We saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and our class would like to go to the show. It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or go shopping. Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have a free time. So on this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and even hair styles. All our class and me would like to see this show. You know what else? We don't need to pay, it's for free because we are students. It's a great opportunity because in our fast developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rare. I think you'll agree that we have changed your programme. As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having a free time. I'm looking forward of recieving a letter from you. Thank you very much. Bye  [SEP]  Hello I'm going to write about ""The Home of the Future"". We can't say straight away how the people's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and create the unbelievable things about future life. Of course there will be differences between todays homes and the future ones. I think the houses will grow up on twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy it. I think more and more people will have at least one flat,  doesn't matter if you are rich or not. The rooms will be designed in a future fashion like less furniture and everything is compact, even TV-set will be on the ciling. The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even  swiching on the light by saying only; ""light"". If course if you have enough money to let your self live in such  apartments, then you can afford it. Now what's going to be the same. Well as I said if you're poor, the government still give you the flat but  very ugly one, probably with rats in it. The same problem will be with homeless people who doesn't have money at all, even to buy a food for themselves. They will have to stay on the streets as  streets is their home. I hope and I wish that the future will bring us a good moments of life where everybody will have  home and a warm, friendly family relationships. Bye. ",25.00
885," Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for informing me that I have won  first prize in your competition  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I will be pleased to send  more further information which you need. In addition, I would like to travel on july because my school will have finished that month so I will be able to go on holiday. And if it is possible, I would rather be accommadated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities  someone who I do not know well. Thank you for asking me to choose  the list of the activities. Either I am in the school swimming team and I am intered in photography professionally. Therefore I would like to improve my skills and knowledge about the subjects during my holiday. Could I please know which kind of clothes I should bring with me and  the company offers us some expensise money to spend? Once again, thank you for sending me  information. I feel, it will be the best holiday, I have ever had. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Who does not like shopping? Perhaps  just men or anybody who has  lack of time or if you are looking for something to buy particular and  shop has not range of variety. Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping. Although I am the one who loves shopping, I can not stand on the Easters, the Christmas and Sundays, because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food, buy some presents etc. However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and  the same time. it causes over crowded shops, high-pitch noise,  lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole  matters just  enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special service such as sending your order with the post or  on  telephone. It could be the solution, avoid busy hours or days, do not bring your child with you, choose the right shop which has  park. ",27.0
529," Dear Manager, I saw your advertisment of your show in the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about some thing. First the musical show, Over the Rainbow started at 20:15, and in the advertisement  was written  at 19:30, then  also was written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show appeared a different actor, that was really disappointing. Also  was written in the advertisment that some discounts were available, but there wasn't  discounts. And because of the time that the show started I couldn't went to the theatre restaurant because it was closed. Mr, I was very disappointed with the show so I want my money back, and I am sure you will understand my reasons. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to speak about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometer distance of Earth and that I was so ashamed because I have been his boyfriend since I have came to Earth. My confession caused a disaster in the life of her and her family, and they called the police to take me out of the planet or  arrested, so that I can't see her again. The police caught me, when I was peacefully in my room, and put me covered with something, in a car. After they caught me I think they brought me to the Area 57, were the police do experiments. Since then I live in Area 57, and this is my diary life. I don't now when I and going to be free, for going to my planet. ",23.0

Therefore I am going to write them down. First, I'd like to travel on July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible. Second, I prefer log cabins than tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents. Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities. Because I've started surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing. Also, painting is one of my favorite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint. Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions. I know everything is included and I don't need to pay anything but in case should I bring some money or not? And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount? Also, could you suggest me what kind of clothes I should bring, please? Thank you very much for reading this letter. I really appreciate your choosing me. I am really looking forward  this camp. Thank you. Truly, Yoshiko Murasaki  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? I'm fine, thanks. Anyway, I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I'd like to write them down! First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I was hired! Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our heart was bumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do so we started working. After working 30 minute, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully! Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusands of funs came in this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert. During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved. Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteres as well. It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you were there with us! Maybe next time! By the way, I think I should go. Please take care and please write to me, right? Love, Yoshiko. ",36.0
217," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre yesterday. I had really expected the show because it was the first time I had seen it in London and I was attracted by your advertisement which looked very exciting. However, I found it very disappointing. Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes on the seat so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not  actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all. Finally, to make matters worse, your restaurant had already closed after finishing the show so I could not eat anything. You mentioned that ""Your perfect evening out!"" in your advert. but it was not absolutely true! So I must insist that I want to have a full refund. I look forward to receiving your cheque as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  For many years scientific and technological break throughs have changed our lives. I think that the more technological developments we have the more comfortable lives we enjoy. Amaisingly, we can find that computer users are getting more and more. So the life is much faster and more convenient than before. My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computer or mordern technology. First of all, using  computer is the most important  for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad. I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear so E-mail is brilliant for my life. In addition to this, doing  internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world. Before I go on holiday I use  internet to book or get details from  travel agency, which means I could save my time and physical energy. In conclusion, in my opinion, there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say ""Enjoy your lives"". ",31.0

150," Dear Sir or Madam, I write to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre  the 9th june. To start with the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't perform as told. They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed  a musical. If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back; it would be the latter. But to add to this I had to make a long queue to get a full price ticket when instead I had brought my student card on the purpose of getting a discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist. The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore me and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed on sanitary reasons. For this deceiving and  uncorrect advertisement and for all the given reasons, I ask you for an average refund of five pounds per ticket. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This feature didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself. He wasn't really wicked, he merely didn't understand  to keep his mouth shut, especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so called ""private life"" runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know. Well, some people just don't care, some are bothered and feel ill at ease. But  small drama can grow up as children are very sensitive. There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to the childhood and the teenage . We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human. According to me what is more to regret is when now we full-growns continue to act with this bad habit. The criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets. What allows us to reveal parts of someone others privacy, nothing. ",29.0
1216," Dear Mrs Smith, I have received your letter dated on the 12th  june 2001. I am very happy to help you and I hope that the informations, that I am going to give you, will be enough. The international student conference will be in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne. The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place ""St-François"". And the name of the street is ""Grand-Chêne"". You can not miss it. After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead  to stay in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us. Afterwards, a live band are going to play  the rest of the night. For the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic. If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free, the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy. There, you can enjoy the Landscape and have a sunbath. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM The aim of this report is to give  further informations on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne. It is based on my own experience. WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM. The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer, for the tourist, an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake. But also, the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues. Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is the olympic history. You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several competitors personal objects. In addition, you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games. REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION. The principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum. CONCLUSION. To sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group. Therefore, if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games, it must be the best place for this. ",31.00
475," 17th June, 2000 Dear Sir/Madam: Or to whom it main concern: I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre. Well I seems to me that you should know what had happened there. First of all, I read your advertisement where it was written that the musical show started at 19.30, but do you know at what hour it started? It started at 20:15! Don't you think it is a lack of respect? Really it was. I forgot to tell you that there were no available discounts. And  tickets were too expensive! Most people couldn't afford them. As a matter of fact, when the musical show was over, I was really hungry. But as I had read your advertisement I knew there was a restaurant. So I went there in order to have something to eat. But can you believed it, it was closed. Absolutely closed. So I asked someone who seemed to be in charge, and he told me that it was too late to have a meal. This really disappoint me. I was both hungry and angry. Well I think that is all, but I will ask you to give  my money back. Looking forward  hearing from you. yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Maybe this is how my story begins. Well first of all Pat was a very  friend of mine. He was really a good friend, until something had happened. I was attending college, as I normally do. With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn from. I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loves. Yes, I think this was the only reason. His name was Cody. He was a very handsome and good looking boy. But far from that, he was a very kind person. Pat told me that he was also in love with me. He told me that it was nessary to do something about . But I didn't know what to do. Pat suggested me to talk to him. But I really didn't managed to do so. As Pat was lossing his patience, he decided to talk to him. I can say that I was very nervious or anxious about what was going to happen. He didn't kept my secret. Pat told him that I was in love with him. This was my secret and now it was not. But  so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me. But on the other hand I will never trust in Pat.

800," I have just received your letter and, firstly, I would like to thank you about  good news. I will give you the information which you asked me  in your letter and also  will ask you some questions. As I understand  is very imortant to confirm the date of  travelling. I would rather choose July because it is  only one month when I have got holiday, long enough to spend it by travelling abroad. Now about accomodation. If it is possible I would prefer to stay in  tent. As I am young I would like to be a romantic person and to be closer to the nature. I think it will be the best way to understand what California means. Ansering to your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming. I am quite good in tennis, especially plaing in two pairs. Also I like swimming and I've got two year experience in teaching swimming in  lesure centre. Could I ask you some questions about clothes and money. Should I take some clothes for  cold weather? The last question - could you tell me some idea about how much money could I need. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. As a women, as a mother and, finally, as an ordinary person, I am doing shopping quite often. Do I enjoy it? If I told you ""yes"" or ""no"", I'd tell you nothing. Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't be concentrate in a shop, but I can't relaxe as well. I am looking on the shelfs but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list. Everybody are pushing me and I think that I came in a wrong place. On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really nesseceraly. I also understand that nobody will do that at my place. However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me  something special and testy. To be honest, sometimes I like shopping. I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kind of food could be in fashing. When I am with my children I can lean them reading, counting, if they only don't run away from me to educate themself in the huge world,  which name is ""shopping"". ",28.0
85," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writting to you because I've been in the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts. As well, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful to you for the next festival. Firstly, I want to congratulate you for the idea, I think that it's very important the development of the arts and that everybody could assist without paying too much. Having a ticket for all the events is a great method because it's an organised way of paying and you win time. On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable to apreciate the event. Other thing, is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't cheat the people by saying that they are from all  the world. In my opinion, you should call more artist from other countries and have some concert halls bigger or may be change the distribution. Well, I think that everything is told but could you tell me, if it's possible, if there will be more plays and films next year? I'm waiting for your answer.  Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Jane, Thanks for your letter, it was nice to hear from you again. I've recently started the classes so all the rules were given to us, like you know,  the first day. As you want me to tell you how about the rules are here, I'll start. Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat . You must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that rules. My mum only doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but  telling her previously. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says. So, I'm free when I'm out of the school. I'd like it would be nicer going there. Lots of love, ",26.00
269," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW' I attended three days ago. I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many  problems. Firstly, the start time  was at 19.30 p.m, but the play started at 20.15 p.m. People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous. Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor  I had never heard from him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that  was impossible to fine another with the same features. As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available, so, moreover I found it expensive. After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense! The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you for returning my money, as I think it is fair. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully, MARIA GARDENT  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But this time things have gone too far. I've know Pat since we were kids. Little by little we were growing up and becaming close friends. I relyied on her and our relationship was excellent. I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now  my mind have changed, because she has done something I can't approve. She has given  away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned. Pat told her I hadn't spent those days with her, but with my boyfriend in the mountain. My mother was so hungry and she told off me so hard that I will remember it  the rest of my life. Moreover I was punished hardly by my father and now we don't talk  each other. Since then I haven't seen Pat anymore and she seems not regret that happened, so I'll try to forget her and carry on  my life that's all. ",26.0
123," Dear Sir, I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see ""Over the Rainbow"", - the musical show -. At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement of the show, nevertheless it has wrong information. First of all, the advertisement of the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot. Appart from that, the show was delayed forty five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry. Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket, which cost me £20. Besides, the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show. Finally I would like to inform you that I had never spent such an umpleasant evening in my whole life. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you - the manager of the theatre - could send me the money back, at least the money I spent on the ticket. Your faithfully LUCCA CALZARI  [SEP]  Unfortunately Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was one of my best friends, but all secrets told to him spreaded throughout the school in a matter of minutes. The worst was that he did it unconciously. When we were in the primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) for his 10th birthday by preparing a fancy dress party in the school. We had been preparing it for three days, we hired fancy dresses, had a cake made by a cook and decorated the gymnasium. Unfortunately, it was me who had to tell Pat about the surprise. Later, I realiced it was the worst thing it could happen to me. On the day of the party, half an hour before it started, Pat came across with a gang of boys from another course. Since they were going to beat him , he desperately told them everything he knew about the party. Afterwards, all of them were around Tim telling him what Pat had confessed. Both Pat and Tim were very disappointed that day. ",28.0
40," Dear: Jane Clark I had been  your annual international art festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. So, I write some of my opionions and suggestions to you. I hope it's may help for next year's festival. The idea of  ""International Art Festival"" was great. But I feel the word of ""International"" was not really suit; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came. I think you should invite more than ten countries. The other problem was choosing space. Like the hall of  classical concert was too small and crowded. Next year, you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was plays and films. It can show more for next year's festival. The Dance Shows as well. And the offer of  ""weedend ticket"" was an excellent idea. Because the price was cheaper than buy it sperate and more convience. Look forward for next year's festival. Yours Sinicerely,  [SEP]  One day, a little girls called Sara. She was walking over a bridge. Suddenly, she heart a men voice called her ""Sara...Sara.. look down to the river."" Then Sara looked down the river. She was very scared. Because she saw a golden fish  was smiling at her and talking to her. After a few second, Sara felt that  golden fish was lovely. She never seen any fish  had that wonderful colour and can talk with her. Because Sara hasn't got any bother and sister, and her Mon and Dad need work everyday, so she was very lonely. Therefore, she came  river everyday and talk  everything to the golden fish. They were very close friend. After half  year,  golden fish suddenly disappear. Sara was very sad. She sat and cry on the river. Then somebody called her name ""Sara... Sara.. look at me.. I'm stand on your left hand side. Sara remembered the was golden fish. She suddenly become a human, a little boy. After a few day they got married. Both together had their wonderful life. This story happened a long time ago. ",22.00
1185," Dear Mrs Smith, I am glad to helping you for the organisation of the international student conference. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube, the building of the conference is then five minutes by footh. At the end-of-conference there is a party, where we can eat something, dance and speak to each other about the conference. For the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes; maybe something black and not red or pink. I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it can be that this information give you some idea too.. On the last day we are going to have about three hours free times. What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum? Of if we will go to hear a classic concert near the conference building's? I hope that I have been able to give you some help. and I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Morgan, I am writing a report,  which  will describe  you the most important building of my town. The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"". It is an old big house of a rich lord in the middle of the town. Into this house there is a big museum, where you could know  the past of Biasco. Under the museum there is a big dark place, where the wine is produced. Your American students could learn how the ,,Meriot ticinese"" is produced and why is it so famous in Tiano. I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco, with its ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda"", is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too. I hope that these informations will bring you to visit Biasco and its ,,house"". Yours faithfully, ",26.00
250," Dear Sir I had been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show in the Circle Theatre. When I saw the advertisement about the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see ""Over the Rainbow"", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about that. First of all, when I bought the tickets I had no discount, and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some, and when I got in the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late. I had had not a perfect night at all, so I would like to ask if I can have my money back. Please give me an answer. Thank you for reading this letter. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  We cannot deny that technology has changed our lives. Nowadays, we do not need anymore to spend hours cooking, for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave, and in a few minutes our meal is ready. We can communicate with people in distant countries in real time, using the internet. There is a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people's lives. I would not do my school projects without using a computer, because I have to do some statistical analysis that I would not do with a calculator. Also, I can communicate with some friends who live in other countries by e-mail almost every day, and I save some money because I pay for a local call, and not for an international call. An other thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone, because people can talk to me whenever they need , but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting.

725," Dear Ms Ryan I am very astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I will say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California already. I have never been in California yet. Now I will give you the further information: I have to travel in July because I had to make sure that I can have  holiday this year and it is the only possebility! I am sure you can take attention on this. I decided to have the accommodation at Camp California  in a tent, because there you will have lots of fun. You can feel the fresh air and listen to  animals, this will be a great oportunety! I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am not well in both activities, but it will be a pleasure to try it espacially surfing, I would like to feel the air in my hair, and enjoy how quick the board goes over the sea. Another question I have; the live there, is it as expensive as I think? And the weather are they only sunshiny days? In the other hand it is not as important, the main reason is I really look forward to go at this Camp and one more time, thanks a lot! Yours sincerely L. Schwartz  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement, we have had a great  argueing. Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home, to wear, but mostly you will have allways not enough. When I decided to go for a shopping, first I will make sure that I have enough time. I am not a typical women because I hate shopping! I am lucky if I will find something which fits. The main reason I hate , there are too many people who are always standing in my way (or maybe I think in that way) and I begin to be angry, normally I am looking those people with evil eyes! I mean, it is too crowdy, you have to wait such a long time before you can pay, and mostly all the things are too expensive! Even before you will find a color you like or the right size of the trousers, you were looking for it a long time, has gone! Lastly, you can see, my opinion about shopping is not very good, then I think shopping is never enjoyable! ",28.0
646," Dear Helen Ryan I am very happy and excited because I have won first prize in our competition. It is a pleasure for me. I am writing to enquire you about some doubts and to give  information that you need about me. I have been working hard here in Portugal and I will be on holiday just in next july. Because of it I believe it is the best date for  travel You asked me about accommodations or Camp California. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in  log cabins. Another question that you asked me was about two activities I will have the chance to do there. I would love play tennis and basketball that I've been playing for six years. About tennis, I just started to play last year and I need to increase my technique too much. I would like to know something about money and clothes. Are they inclued in the prize? How much money I can spent during this time? I'd prefere  if you give me this information as soon as you can. I am look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely Rui Veloso  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am very happy with your letter that I received last week. I'm too excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month. I suppose you know about  ""Portugal Pop Concert"" that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month, aren't you? It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there. I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all  time, what wasn't very difficult. You will can't believe how many famous people I known. I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes. It was a dream and she was amazing with me. I didn't tell you, but I helped in this concert just by a chance. A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said ""yes"" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life. Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations. However, these days were unforgatable to me. Hope to hearing from you soon With best wishes, Rui ",28.0
403," 16th November 2000 Dear Sir I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show. According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening. Firstly, the actors weren't those announced. Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove; we had mean actors. As for the times, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15. Likewise, there were no discounts avalaible. To end, in spite of being opened, the restaurant was closed for reparations. Because of all those inconvenients, I ask you  a total refund. I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company. You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important; because she trusted in him; immediatly he came to see one of his friend to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students of her class knew about what she had just said the day before to Pat. So immediatly she went towards Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up. Because of his behaviour, now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him. ",26.0

At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform without any explictions , and the show should started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!! I was sure that discouts were available because I have read it , but at the tickets office they didn't accept them. What a terrible evening! So I payed  the ticket.

But when he walked out  the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train. Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it. He was worried about his mother's reaction, but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager's office and he found it on the table. He was so happy! All this story was a secret but Pat realived  to his mother. She was so angry and confused because Jim haven't told her the truth. ",26.0
896," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel on July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month. For the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I can not sleep in  tent. I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for speed sensations. I am good in those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend. I would like to now more information about clothes. I think that  weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold, but I do not know if I must take  lot of pullovers. Best regards Henri  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a statement  of men in general. Women like to go to do shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands. Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive. Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because the shopping loses a lot of time  controry to  women, because if they have a free time, they will go to do shopping. I think that  child does not like shopping because he often waits, and I prefer to play with these friends. He goes to do shopping only if he has not clothes. To conclude, I think that ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" is a true statement, but not always for all people. ",25.0
1083," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writting this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London. I see that you has already organised the programme. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for ""the London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and they would all like to go to the show. So I'm writting this letter, asking, if you can change the programme. The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is realized once a year, there are the latest Fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hair styles, all things that a young people wants to see. There is a great opportunity to go there because the students need not pay anyting. I'm suggesting how  programme could be changed. The fashion  starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be realized on 14 March, so we can change the shopping with this event that is realized in the afternoon, and put the shopping at night. There will be a great success! Your sincerely, X teacher.  [SEP]  The Dangerous Mission. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it""... That was my situation at the moment. The story had began two days before... ""The Honorable men's group"", Dick, Nick and I, has formed this group. Our mission was, stealing the women's panties, I think that it was very stupid, but it was the most difficult thing that the humanity can do. It prove our bravura to be a man. Our first chalenge was stealing Dick's girlfriend's pantie, but it failed. And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we had a conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult. So we tried to stole adult's panties. Nick and Dick could prove their bravure stealing from their mother's panties. I was the only one that couldn't stole any panties. So I decided to go to my grand mother's house and try to steal some panties. But she was a very angry woman. ""It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it"", to prove my bravure to all. I had quickly, entered in my grandmother's room and started to get some panties. I was very nervous that I forgot my shoes. Next day my Grand mother come and she gave my shoes to my mother. That was the most dangerous mission of my life. ",22.00
452," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to explain how was my experience  in the theatre last Friday. I did not expect to find all the problems that I had. Firstly, I would like to say that the actor who played  was not the same one that I read  in the advertisement. Secontly, the musical show began fourty-five minutes later and nobody explained me what was happened. Thirdly, I did not receive any kind of discounts when I payed although in the advertisement it was written . After the musical show, I went to the theatre restaurant but I could not have had dinner because it was closed. I think that if the musical show will begin later the restaurant should close later, too! Finally, from my point of view, I would like to receive the money that I payed because it was not the same as you offered in the advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I think when you explain a secret you must be sure that you have chose the best person to keep it. In your life you will meet a lot of people and you should choose your friends. When I was a child my friends were my companions of class and, especially my neighbours. In the summers I always were playing with them on the street. When I was fourteen years old some things changed. I prefered going by motorbike with the people who studyied with me in the Institute. But, until you are twenty years old you choose your best friends. When you go to the university you are a person who can begin to make a good friends. You have an experience to know people and now you have an opportunaty to select good friends. You must select well if you want to have very good friends. For theses reasons, I think that you should know well the person who wants to explain a secret  and  keep it. ",24.0

Because there were other actors  which played too badly. I don't understand why you changed them. I hoped to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove as was presented in an advertisement. You had to start the show at 19.30 p.m. but you started too late at 20.15 p.m withour any ecxpenetion to people. Why did you put into the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? It wasen't!!! Any kinds of tickets were  original prase. After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed because there someone has fixed something. I had the very disappointing evening so I would like to ask for return my money . I got the ticket for £20. I am hearing to looking fermards from you. Yours faithfully, Ilya V.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I knew that but I needed someone who could understent and support me at that moment. I told to her about my pregnency because she has  friend who works in a hospital as a doctor. I asked her for hepl and she promised me  do everythings what she can and keep my secret. Pat gave same advise for me and I disayded to have an operetion. In a week time my classmates and teachers started to toking from me. I understand who told my secret to everyone. I got the big dipress but my parents supported me. We had a big conversation. They stopped me to do the operetion. Then I was 15 years old. Now I am 16 and I have got  nice baby boy. My family very love him  and support us. I still go to school and I have plan go to a college on next year. I would like to tell to everyone, don't be naive when you share with sameone your big secret or promlem. First tell to your parents. I am sure it is the best way. Ofcoure secrets can be different...

557," Thuesday 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I've just received your letter, and I am very delighted to be the winner. I thank you.. As regards to the time I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only  on July because I am very tied up  this time owing to he exam period which will last until the end of June. I'd rather have accommodation in tents, it would be a good experience for me especially because I haven't lived it as well as it is more romantic. As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do. The swimming is my best sport. I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete. The sea is part of myself. Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball, despite the fact that I am not too tall for this kind of sport. However, I used to play basketball in my school because we hadn't  other sport pitch except of the basket pitch. Finally, would you mind to send me more information about the amount of money that I should have. Also, what about the life out of the camp? Are there other places for entertainment especially for the night life? Could you send me some brochures for the place where we will stay in? Thank you again, and I am looking forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about the short video which my college is going to make about the daily life of our school. It considers two points: the lessons and  activities which should be filmed. I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful. There are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, despite the artificial sunbathing. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is  good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that  owns. In addition, we can film the library which possesses thousand of works. Books of various interest, with up-to-date facilities such as computers  internet, CD and cassettes. We shouldn't disregard and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better. Finally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim. ",32.0
1087," Dear Mr. Robertson, I would like to say ""thank you"" for this London trip plan. We are really excited about it. Especially the boat trip on  river  is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich. We also enjoy the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus. It seems it's going to be a great fun. I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in ""Time Out"" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convinient - March 14 -, and it is on   Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there. As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about English culture besides the language itself. Joining this fashion and leisure show, we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things, such as new hair styles and make up ways, or what is  fashion in London recently. Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another chance to go to the Science Museum in any other day, but this show is just for this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope, it wouldn't cause a trouble to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Although human is a social creature, all people need an area  to be able to stay away from other people. This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life. Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others. It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit. Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. Press takes this demand as an order, and ""but  public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people. In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend too much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quiet sure,  even the ones, who have chosen their occupies just to be famous, don't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone. The situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this. Obviously, there is no point in saying ""famous people have a right to their own live."" Although this statement is absuletely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will  keep living with journalists. ",34.00
918," Dear Helen Ryan, Thanks for your letter, I am so glad that I have won first prize in your competition. And thanks again for offer me two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job. July is the only free time that I have. And I prefer tents to log cabins, as I know tents better than log cabins. I used to sleep in  tent once on my holiday, and  tent is more suitable for camping. It is very kind for you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to have climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town. For sailing, well, I haven't try it before, that is why I want to have a try. I think it must be fun. As you said, all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but I am sure I still need  some money with me. How much do you think that I will need. By the way what kinds of clothes do you think I have to get with me? And is there anything eles I have to get with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I think most people will agree with ""shopping is not always enjoyable"". Because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time. Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing shopping. Yes, it is true, this is only because nowadays people have more money than even before, and some women don't earn money, they have no idea how diffcult  to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable! So it is depend on different case. For me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only go to shop unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me, I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you face  the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do. Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of  times, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifes, they are hopeless. Those are only my opinions, you don't need to agree with it, but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong.

434," For the attention to the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were invited to the estatement were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing on his performance. In addition, the event was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we  were able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to the Chef who leaded the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts for the tickets would be available, but it was not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization of the theatre bring  my money back. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and she told her mother what had happened during the concert. Peter had a terribly problem with drugs. He started to consum the stuff at the age of twenty. He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down to Australia, but Peter was used to live in New York,  overcrowded and  surronded by people. Australia is a country too calm for him. We invited him to enjoy the concert of Texas but he started to make nonsenses because of the drugs. Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert. A security guard saw it and put his attention on him. Pat stared at him and asked for help. The security guard heard her and agreeded with Pat that if Peter continued acting on this way he would obliged us to go out of the concert. He did it. When we arrived at home, Pat told to his mother what had happened. ",24.0
648," Dear Helen Ryan! This is just a note to confirme  you, what I had recive your letter. I am so happy to have won this first prize in your competition. I will be happy to be for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I am understud from your letter, what all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me, including transport to and from the airport. To answer your questions, I would like to tell you, what my travel can be possible only on July, because I will have the Cambrigge exam till 1 July. Would it be possible to have accomodation at Camp California in a tent, because I didn't have  chance to sleep into it. And would it be possible to do swimm and surf. I am very good  swimming. I done it since I remeber me. In surf I am not good at all. I have been driming about this activitie since I had 10 years old. I would like to know about how many peopl will stay with me into the tent, and  have a take with me  special clothes for doing serf. I will contact you, if I will have more questions. I look forward to beeing at Camp California in the U.S.A.  Your faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I like shopping. I love to do shopping. But if only I have money!! Ore some money. Shopping can't be enjoyable if you don't have money to spend. It is better to stay at home and read a good book. I'm thinking do shopping in the big spaise like Harrodss it's not  plesure. Because it's crowding of people. I'd like to be in small boutiques, and I would rather go to shopping along and during the weekand time. Because I don't like to give some advise it's can be willy boring. And go to shopping at the end of  weekand it's not for me. I don't know what I can tell you more? I'm sorry. Drop me a line or give me a call if my writing will not so good for you. Because I'll be out next week. And I'll mees your lessons. ",22.0
1208," June 12, 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, In replied of your letter, I will try to give you some advices. Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow. For the conference, I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important persons of others colleges. At the end of the conference, all students and leader will have a drink. To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk on the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful. I hope I give you enough details. I look forward to meeting you on the conference. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The building called in French ""Le Centre Pompidou"" is a very surprising monument. It's a modern building with an architecture that you can't see in  other place. What is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building. On the Pompidou's center, there are different expositions on different themes. In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures. This expositions are often very attractive and they change every year. Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view on the city. So if you visit Paris, the Pompidou's center is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many others buildings. ",27.00
248," Dear Sir, Being on a holiday trip in London, I dreamed  to go to the theatre for a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought ""It is that one that I want to try."" In fact, your musical show was attractive: actors, time, restaurant, discount tickets, and also the title! I started to be OK with the ""Your perfect evening out"", sure  not  to be deceived. But all was disappointing! First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised  he totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the scene! Second bad point: beeing not narrowminded, I accept other actors.. but  if the show begin on time - he began at a quarter past eight P.M. There were no discount places because it was not planed like this by the theatre. What was written on the advertisement? The summum was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for ""holidays"". I was terribly ennoyed! I spent the worse evening of my holiday in this show! So I need now a ""perfect - money back -"" for replacement of your ""perfect evening out"". I do hope you will accept and understand this request. Yours:  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" First of all, ""daily life"" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. Up to two years ago, I was working with a written booknote or agenda, and I used to phone with a wired phone system. Nowaday, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that authorizes me to connect to  Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get informations and electronic mails. I am always joinable with my mobile phone, that is also sometimes boring! Being in an apprenticeship, I go  both work and university. At the university, I have learned with computer aided systems. I often go on  Internet to find informations for studying a precise subject more accutely (university technology sites). At work my personal job uses two standard PC with specifical softwares plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a particular computer that my firm is developping now. At home, I have got a personal computer for my mails and accounts, and electronic mail plus  internet for keeping connected to my friends that are at the other end of France or Germany, Korea and so on. So modern technology has totally changed my daily life! ",31.0
1111," Dear Mr Robertson, Regarding the programme you have organised, it is  great ideas everything that you have planed, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement. It is  good start to go on  sightseeing by bus on Monday morning,  we can se all  famous buildings in a few hours. It's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river. The idea about going to  science museum is fantastic, I read about the museum,  it is really interesting in science history. After all morning in the Museum, it is wonderful and on tuesday doing some shops, whereas the student have another idea for tuesday. On Wednesday after  viseted  national Art Gallery, we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon. The advertisement that  students saw is about a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Freedom! Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and  television is  private life of famous people. It is really interesting how people like knowing  famous people life. Without someone famous know, photographs take pictures secretly,  try to get money on it. Sometimes being famous can get stress,  everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions  questions. Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places, because nobody like  famous politicians or film stars without asking questions. On the whole, to be rich and famous don't always bring happeness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous. ",21.00
805," Dear Sirs! First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation. I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer  tents. For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature. I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California. I've chosen singing and swimming. Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well. I'm also used to sing in front of a large number of people 'couse I did it several times. I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional. There are two further questions which I have to ask you. First How much money do I have to take with me? and what clothes should I choose? I'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer this questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim! Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered a competition. I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it.  But it was true. My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life. Hope you answer this letter as soon as possible. Lots of hugs and kisses ",36.0
242," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writting this letter to complain about the treatment that we have received when we went to the Circle theatre in order to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" whose actors were Anthony Keens and Tina Truelove. When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we were waiting during a long time, because that you advertisement noticed that the musical show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15. Moreover, the actors were not the same of  the advertisement. Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on holidays. This evening was the worst evening of all my life. I would like that you give me back some money of the tickets. I look  to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully. PEDRO REZ SORAN  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil. Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil rapidly. Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea in the outskirts of the city. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen. Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a beatiful garden. When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased. We had to come back to Spain. Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs. When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain  our parents all  our adventure. That day was the worst day of all my  life. Nowadays, Sally and I are married, have three children, a marvellous house and both of us are working in a big company. ",26.0
1200," Dear Mrs. Smith my name is ..., I am a local student and i will give you the requested information. The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city-centre. The hotel is just three busstops away from our college. So you and your students can take the bus from the central busstation that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference. The end-of-conference party starts just one our after the end of the conference. It is located in our sports hall. There will be live music and a midnight dinner. So you don't have to appear very noble dressed, just as you like it (there is no order - you may wear what you want). For your last day I think it would be interesting to vistit our historical and famous city-centre. I will organize a tourist guide to give us information about the old buildings and sights. If you have any more questions write me a short letter. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The invention of the car was a great point in history. From there on people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted. Of course within the physical barriers. People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home-countryside. In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there. It has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city. I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go. Today I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work and to meet my friends at any place and any time. So with my car I achieved a great freedom.  ",31.00
797," Dear Sir, I am writing to you in reply to your letter. First of all I want to give you the thanks for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been in the USA, so I think that this travel will be an unforgetable experience. Secondly, I will like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school. In August I have to be in Madrid because I am going to work as a trainee in a travel agency. After august I must return to school, so I can only go to California in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like very much the nature and camping, so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin. Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good in swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good in tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and which kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know the money that I have to take and which amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look foward to receiving your reply. Yours sincerely, Silvia Torroja.  [SEP]  In my opinion the statement 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' is totally true. An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like. Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue  trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example. I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments you don't know what to say. In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping is boring I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment. So, shopping is not enjoyable, but necessary. ",37.0
413," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" which I went to see last week. First of all, the actors that played  the show were differents to Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Besides of this they were not good as actors, so I am quite disappointed. Then, the show had to start at half past seven and I had to wait fourty-five minutes because it started later. But it is not all because in the advertisement  appeared the possibility of discounts  available and it is false, I had to pay £20 for each ticket. Finally, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant and have a good dinner after the show but it was impossible. The restaurant was closed because most of the employees was on holidays and there were not enough people to attend the demand. In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund of the tickets. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and now my best friend knows that I will go to visit her next week. Alice is my best friend and we met twenty years ago. We went to the same school and we had the same hobbies. It was perfect because we always were together and doing interesting activities like snow board. One day her mother died and she had to move to Germany where her sister was living. But she was very sad because she knew that it will be very difficult  to see eachother in the future. After that, we wrote letters and she phoned me once time a week but it wasn't the same. I couldn't explain all my problems to her and her voice had changed. Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted that it was a surprise. I worked hard during one month and I could save  money to buy a ticket for the plane. I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she didn't say anything but it wasn't true. Yesterday she phoned to Alice and explained all. In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities  to do together and  to spend the best week in our lifes.

160," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre. I recently went there to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true. For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and  a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning. All these problems spoiled my evening and frustrated me, since I was expecting to see a good play, so I expect a full refund. By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as it was said in the advertisement? I look forward to hearing from you and having my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  The New Modern Life Modern technology and science have changed my life in many ways. The easy access to information and the new ways of communicating with other people help me save time that I can spend doing whatever I want to. Of all the recent technological advances, the one that had the great impact on my life was the Internet. It provides you  all the information you want. I don't watch the news on television anymore, because I can use my computer to read only the things that interest me. Mobile phones are another thing that is making my life much easier. They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are. This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution. All these things save me lots of time. I get to rest more and spend more time at home, and so they make me a happier person. For the next  years, we can expect many more technologies that will continue making our lives easier. ",33.0

YOUR ADVERTISING LEAFLET WAS COMPLETELY WRONG, IT SAID THAT DANNY BROOK WAS ACTING BUT, WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY ON STAGE. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING, SPECIALLY FOR ME WHO IS A GREAT FAN OF DENNY. THAT'S NOT ALL! IT STARTED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE RIGHT TIME AND WE HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE THEATRE. THE TICKETS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISCOUNTS BUT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING  TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE WRONG, THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DISCOUNTS TO ANYONE. AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED ON THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS. I'VE NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS. FOR ALL THIS REASONS MY EVENING WAS TERRIBLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST PART OF MY MONEY BACK.

WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS, WRITE, LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND, NOWADAYS, YOU CAN DO ALL THIS THINGS USING A COMPUTER. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS THAT MEN INVENTED IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO LOT'S OF THINGS AND TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO USING A PC. MOST OF MY DAY I SPEND IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, STUDYING, RESEARCHING, PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

On the advertisement it had been written that there would have been Danny Brook too. (I like him very much and, truly, I came to the theatre just to see him) When I entered I didn't get the discount (as it has been written!!) The show had to started at 19:30 and I arrived before, frightened  not to find a good place to see ""my hero"". I have waited for the show beginning until 20:15!!!! Is it a correct thing? I was getting angry, but, finally, the show started and I became quiter. BUT.. when I saw that the actor wasn't Danny Brook but a different one, I was very disappointed. So, after the show, I would like to have a good meal in the ""famous theatre restaurant"" (that, of course, was closed for a free night!!!!) At the end, I asked for  money back (and paiment for my orrible night): do you think anybody  give me back something?! I hope, that in the future, you will understand that it isn't right to write false things on an advertisement. Thank you for your attention. Faithfully  [SEP]  Science and technology characterize our moder society. They have taken a big progress in our every day life and they have always become more important for us. If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comfort (born just in the ""industrial age"") everything had to be done by hands or by animal work: I think in that time life was really  harder than now! We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society ""their good fruits"" but, at the same time,  negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or ""green"" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize are the main problems of our society. I know I'm  ""daughter of this techological world"" and unluckly I think I could'n stay without it: it's rather strange that today there's already somebody without  phone, dishwasher, TV... But, sometimes I ask myself if the ""ancient world"", without science, technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the our one. ",21.0
1147," Dear Mrs Smith With reference to the information that you had requested, the hotel that had been booked is the Holiday Inn, in New Port and to get to the University of Wales wich is not far from the hotel, you only need to take a divertion where clearly indicate Carleon and once that you are on the main road all you need to do is to follow the country road which take you direct to the place. Concerning to the Party at the end of the Conference, this will be formal there fore you will need formal clouding as you know there will be Company directors, Managers etc . As for the last day I would suggest you to take a visit to the locall museum and the ruin's   Castle. In the fist you will find a very intresting collection of Roman Vestiges, also you can visit another section wich it supoused to be a Roman cite. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  I always had consider myself been very looky to be born in the  Century because  all the amaizing human inventions. As an example let's have a look and we will see of this nation  how it has developed. We just need to think about the first world wold and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution to these day. However I feel that at the moment there should emerge more grups to control this development because  the industrial polution that it has been created and it seems that its very little what has been done at the moment in relation to our embiroment. I hope in the future there will be more and more people interested in this important issue. ",21.00
1049,"  Mr. Robertson: First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks about the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon. After reading the hole organized programme, we all agreed about the sightseeing  by bus around London wich will give us the knowledge about this fantastic city we all want to meet since  time ago. The main purpose of our letter it's to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. We found the advertisment in a local newspaper article and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists on these topics: . Latest Fashions . Leisure and sports wear . Make up . Hairstyles. On the other hand, and the most important, it is free for students. After being discussing , we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re-arranged. Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show wich is opened on Tuesday, march 14 from 10 am to 19 pm. After that we could continue our trip as it had been arranged previously. Yours sincirely  [SEP]   Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie. A good book should interest, amuse or teach the reader something. Agatha Christie always was my favourite writer. Not only because she's famous or wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce caracthers or how to tell a good story us though decieving the readers. One of her most interesting and famous work is a novel called ""The Orient Express"". It's a detective story, like all the stories written by her. In our words the story is settled on a train wich tooks a trip along the orient. On the train, all the passangers seem to be involved in a crime. This is such a fasinating story or it's the way Agatha Christie tells it. The mistery is kept until the last page of the book. I read it and I have really enjoyed it. It has been  fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story, try to read Agatha Christie's detective story and you wouldn't regret it at all. ",11.00
506," Dear Sir/Madam I have visited your theater and I was very dissapointed because of the number of reasons. I've read your advertisment and in reality to what was written there was different. There was no Danny Brook but instead of him  was a different actor and I'm very dissapointed about it because I'm his fan. The show started much later, on 45 minutes later than it should be so I was late for the bus. There were no discounts availible so I overspended the money. The theater restaurant was closed for no reason availble to me. It was a realy bad evening and because of it could you possibly give  my money back? Because it was just a waste of money to go to your show. Yours Faithfully Vaisili Solatov  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this. We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon. He was one of the first people who I get know. After a few days he was already my best friend. Everything was going perfectly befor last month when I met a girl from the other school. Her name was Marine. I saw her as a perfect girl with who I fallen in love with. So one day she offered to me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal. I had decided to go. So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climed out of the window. Unfortunately for me Pat at the time went to  toilet and saw me. So I asked him to keep it in secret. I came back at 6 o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again. Next day my best friend went to  headmaster and told him about me so he gave me a sespend. ",24.0
215," London, 20th may, 2000 Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam, I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I have seen last Sunday at the evening. Firstly, I become very disappointed because of the actor, who was different from  your advertisement, not Danny Brook was starring. Secondly, I was ready at 19:30 time, as you have announced, and I had to stay waiting in front of the theatre until 20:15, when finally the show began. Besides of all, at the end of the Musical, I went to the your Theatre Restaurant, in order of taking a dinner, because I have leaft home without eating and so I was hungry at that time. Thus, you cann't believe what was my disappointment when I noted that it was closed, without no explanation. Finally, I would like to say you that I am asking for  money back, because I had an evening totally despleased, completely different  that you have anouced in your advertisement. So, I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? First of all, modern technology have changed my daily life  the last five years more quickly than in the anchient time, or even than a ten years ago. I became to notice the difference in my work, since when all tasks have changed to the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine. In addition, at the University teachers not accepted  more written tasks done by hand, but only they should be written by  computer. Besides, teachers began asking us  a lot of article  to be copied throught the internet. From that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge. Firstly I become to write letters and articles, next I learned several computers plays. When I learned how to use  internet, I didn't stop until now. Nowadays, I cann't stay one day without consulting computers communications throught e-mail or  internet. I change corespondecies with all my family by  internet,  my mother and 2 brothers who live in Curitilra City and so with a brother who live in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand. On balance, I can affirm that I couldn't  without this modern technology today. My life wouldn't be the same another time without these progress. ",23.0
318," Dear Sir or madam For weeks I've been planing to go to this threatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster has all of us. To begin with on your advertisment you say that Danny Brooks will be starring  the show but instead their was a different actor which made us very disappointed. Another thing that is written on the advertisment is that the night show will start at 7:30 but instead of that their was  forty five minute delay The crowded got really upset and we were going to leave with the first chanse we had To make matters worse the restaurant of the theatre was closed. You can understand how that made me feel, and when the tickets had no discount To top of it all, this wasn't the perfect evening out. It was the worst night of my life. So I expect nothing less than a full refund of the money I paid to see this so called show. If you don't do as I say an article in the biggest newspaper will deffenetly change your ming Yours sincerely  [SEP]  What are going to look the clothes  in a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to have colours, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxershorts? This is something that has trabled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry. Fashion has made a big progress since the ealary beggining of the world. The variety of new fabrics,  colours and quality,  make new fashions statements every day. Although the clothes are getting more and more smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashing  the women to wear only skirts. Long ones actually and  men to wear trousers. In the sixties people worn clothes with flowers, big glasses,  jeans, and men should have had long painted hair. Nowdays women were really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pearce their bodys just like girls do. and the other way around. If this continues the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (;practically people won't be wearing any clothes) People will were extreme. Clothes which will be really Lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but nowone wears them. ",24.0
650," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now, I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written on it. First of all, I would like to travel only in the month of July, because during the month of June, I'm going to work and in September I have to study a lot, because school will start . Speaking about accommodation, between tents and log cabins, I woul prefer  tents, because I love the adventure and also because I can be freer. I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have choosen two from your list: Basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been taking part in a strong team for three years. The other one I have choosen is swimming; for the same reason why I chose Basketball. But, what about clothes, money, food? I hope you will take my answers into consideration. Thank you for now. Yours faithfuly Simone Pausini  [SEP]  Many people ""see"" at shopping like an amusement, but I think it's not always a good translation to give it. In my opinion to do shopping is often funny, above all when you can enter without difficulties into a shop. For exemple, if the shop is full of people,  is not enjoyable, because they will create too  confusion, too  noise with the risk of leaving time. Shopping is a funny thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have  free time and when you can relax yourself. Another thing that regardes  me, is that I enjoy my self more when I know I have to do shopping for me than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!! ",24.0
868," Dear Madam, I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition and want to thank you for that very interesting competition. I am only available in July because I am studying in an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July! You asked me which  accommodation I would prefer between  tent and  log cabin. I am used to spend summer holiday in  tent and I like it, but why not try  log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could practice tennis and surfing. In fact, I soon practice tennis and I am quiet good at , and it will  the occasion to train myself surfing is completely unknown for me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not! Finally, I wanted to know if I need  money and how many, and if there is a dry cleaning. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully Anis LACOSTE  [SEP]  We know all what shopping is. Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable. When you got to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but there is no more of it. You think that shopping is not enjoyable at all. Sometimes it is necessary but you spend four or five hours in the supermarket because there is too much people. You don't like shopping but you must go shopping to eat! But sometimes you go shopping for pleasure and you have all your time (the girls know what it is). finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of  time it isn't enjoyable! To conclude, if you don't want to go to the supermarket to spend four hours there, send your girlfriend and it will be more enjoyable! ",33.0
828," Dear Miss Ryan, I have safely received your letter bringing the good news. I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found  that I won the competition. Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received. I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience. Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember. Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons. Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just stay in Camp California all the time? I hope that I haven't taken up too much time. Thank you for this exciting news. I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime! Yours sincerely, (Au Kwan Ming)  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience. The concert was held at our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result. Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements. I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall. I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular. It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers. I really enjoyed myself and I hope that you can have the chance to experience this too. I hope that you can write to me soon. I look forward to reading what you have to say. Bye for now! Yours faithfully, (Au Kwan Ming)  ",40.0
826," Dear Ms Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I am very happy to hear that I have won the first prize. I am writing to inform you about my requests. I also have some questions. First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' for my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times. Finally, could you please let me know what kind of clothes I should take with me? I would also like to know how much money I should take with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you and travelling to the U.S.A. Yours sincerely, Chi Kimura  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Last month I helped at a pop concert. The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'. This bank is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famous. I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience. First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The music instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in  flesh. The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work. I was so exited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band . I want to help at a pop concert again! I am looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",36.0
929," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part of ""Camp California in the USA"". I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July. I am finishing my study in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job. I would prefer to live in a tent during your camp. I have always dreamt about sleeping in a tent, in sleeping bags, but my parent always took me to expensive hotels, so it would be a nice adventure for me. During the camp I would like to pratise my swimming (I have attended swimming lessons for 3 years) and also I would like to learn how to do some good photos. (I have no experience!) I would be really glad if you could tell me something about clothes I should bring with me. (Do I need any special garments?) and could you tell me please, if I need some extra money to pay for anything like trips or photo-paper. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping could be fun! Sometimes I like doing it during long Sundays. I like going between colourful shelfs and picking some nice things for dinner or for decorating our house with. I love talking with my mum during shopping, meeting new people or old friends. Sometimes unfortunatelly shopping could be very annoying, especially at Christmast or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usually. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!) At Christmas or Easter time all shops have usually an unpleasant smell (because of the crowd) and are very noisy! Another period when I don't like doing shopping is when there is a huge sale! I always go absolutely crazy when I have to do shopping then! You cannot breath, you cannot see anything apart from a bulk of shouting women and men who want to get something cheaper! Next,  not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to. You just cannot refuse buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it. In my opinion, shopping could be really enjoyable! The only advice would be: ""Do not do your shopping at Christmast or Easter time"" - but it will not make any sense, will it? So you just have to get used to it, and enjoy your shopping for the rest time of the year! ",36.0
358," Manager Date 17-06-00 xxxx Dear Sir, I'm writing to complain about the performance,  Over The Rainbow at The Circle Theatre on the 14th of June. It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on your holiday to London. London is one of Europe's biggest centre and you can always get the best in show business . Rescently I decided to watch Over The Rainbow, a very famous and wellknown show. Firstly, the night performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement told. Furthermore, I was shooked when one of the main persons entered the stage. He wasn't Danny Brook, one of the resons for my choice . Finally, the Theatre Restaurant was under reparation so we had to find another one for the evening supper. This wasn't ""my perfect evening out"", as said, and I'll make a claim for half the money back. I'm looking forward to receiving you reply as soon as possibly. Yours faithfully, Kim Nissen  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life. A century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge behind them, we've got the word ""time"". Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no rush. In modern days we have to wear a mobile phone. I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner, I could see those busy people  always on their way . I heard the different phone signals, and what a miracle you can change them on the train when you are restless. A new word has appeared in those days, a technical proof of this is the computer. I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless. In nearly every home you can find it and the users now and in the future are the new generation. I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role , exspecially today when fuel is so expensive. Watch out highly advanced technologies are appropriate and helpful for me and others if we only remember the importance of  time to be together. ",23.0

First of all I would like to travel in July because I am going to Ibiza with my parents in June and in August I start to work part-time, so I am afraid but I can go only in July. With reference to the accommodation I would prefer  log cabins to  tents. I think the log cabins are more comfortable and I have never slept in a tents. I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I am playing at least at the weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos to animals. I would like to know, how much  I need and what type of clothes I should take? Could you tell me about the weather, please? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are very well. I am writing about my exciting experience at a pop concert. First of all I was too busy but it does not matter because I enjoyed a lot of this experience. I was doing different activities from designering flier to selling tickets. I had to search in the internet  pictures that could be used for the flier. We booked the accommodation for the group. I was responsible for checking the light and sound. In addition I checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone. As you know I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too. Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experience in my life, but the concert day was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event.

1232," Dear Madam, I received your letter and I'm pleased to answer your questions. M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel. This is a first class hotel. The easiest way  from the hotel to the conference is with the bus. There is a bus stop in front of your hotel. Take the bus in  direction   center  town. After four stops get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road. You can't miss it. Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco. For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans. Finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town. It takes you two hours. Afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland. If you have any more questions, write me back. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I will write about the invention of the computer. With the computer our work is easier and more interesting. Before the time with computers, people had to write every time a whole letter . When they  would correct a word, they had to write the whole letter again. With the computer we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person. I work at a bank and I work all day with computers. If we hand't ay one, we had to write all the transactions on papers. If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after. But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post, the money will arrive two or three days after. I have never work without a computer, but if we hadn't any we would it find normally. ",29.00
46," Dear Jane Clark, The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you for the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there must be some improvements to make this festival better. Firstly, there were stars and artists only from six countries. This number may be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concerts holls were too small for this much people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you are very successful about finding good stars. The films and plays were not so many. As a result of this the kinds of films were not enough. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say with the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted any kind of people. Another paht is the tickets. The weekend ticket is excellent because it is not so expensive and it allows  to see everything. But I was disappointed that there were no competition between the films performed I think there should be an Oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films.  [SEP]  Dear Elinor, I'm so glad to receive your lost letter because I've started to think that you were angry about me for not writing for a long time. I promise I'll write more The school rules are horrible here. We are restricted  to do nearly everything. The school is like a dungeen here. I don't went to be so evel about school but the rules are rules and they are limiting us with the borders of our school. We must wear the uniform-like clothes all the day and  week They don't even let us to wear different sweaters - etc other than dark blue. It is boring. We are not allowed to compare our thoughts during the lessons becase the teachers think that we are chatting. How poor their imagination are!! However we are free at home. You could do anything you like as long as you have good grades. If you don't, you hear the same word every day, ""Study, Study, Study""! Nobody likes to study but we have to.

1179," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference. Next week I will be start organising some events for this conference. The event will organize at the Palace Hotel. The same hotel that will you stay . Palace Hotel is opposite the park `Clifton', which is near the college. We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we don't need to use a transport. Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to  hotel I think that  is better  to come all the group in  college and then we can go all together to the `Palace Hotel'. The conference start at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before. Concerning the end-of-conference  I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. Tell me your idea. About the clothes that we need to wear,  must be  uniform, because  is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges. Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing-crossing around London. You will have the opportunity  visiting some museums and  zoo parks. I think it is a nice idea. If you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047***. Please if you have  more ideas send me a letter. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowdays all the people have a telephone. Telephone is part of our life. It is one of the most important investigation all over the world. Telephone is  type of communication. If you want to talk with your friends, parents, partner or to ask something, you can call them without wondering how  can be communicate with them. Especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and everyday and you don't feel that they are far a way from you. Today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone. They are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line. Also you can leave a message if you call and can't find someone. The last type of telephone, is the mobile phone. You can use it everywhere and at anytime. Finally  telephone except|apart from   type of communication, is  type and socialisation. Nowadays who are so bussy and we don't have free time to see our friends,  we can call them and talk or chat with them. Especial the young people are using many hours  the telephone and that is trouble for their parents.

First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to . I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin. I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography, I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before. Finally, I would like to know what sort of clothes do  advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid , do I need to take a lot of money with me? Thank you a lot for all these details. Yours sincerely Jasmine Martin  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I have a lot of different things to tell you about what happened at the concert. It was really an amazing experience. First, I had to spend all  the day before the concert in the field where it took place, I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments. I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood. I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage. As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group. That was the best. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours, Brenda ",34.0
882," Dear Sir/Madam I am glad to hear from you recently and I really appreciate your invitation to California. I would like to tell you about my preference. To start with I would rather stay in a log cabin because two weeks might be too long to stay in a tent and a log cabin would be more convenient for me. When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident with this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym would retrieve my concerning. In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular especially in California. And I also have to ask you what kinds of clothes will be suitable there. Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy surveniers because this will be  first time for me to visit Carifolnia. Finaly, I must choose traveling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work. Thank you very much for your time and I am looking forward to visiting there. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Needless to say, shopping can cause you a waste of time and money. However some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable. Those who love shopping are usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping. However, things which you can get by money  necessarily fill your unsatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be bigger. And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your pertners. What you want is often different from what your friend wants. Unless either you or your partner is really tolerant, shopping could result in another stress. So it is advisable not to make a friend whose hobby is shopping. In addition to these, everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you how  silly decision you had done at the moment. On the whole, shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you migh be extravacant, lose your friends and have what you don't need. ",28.0
1217," 12th June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference. First of all, the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel. It is very near York Railway Station  which you can get there easily. By rail: get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side. By bus: most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station, or you can take a taxi. Secondly, the conference is  very important event for all of us, we agree to wear formal dresses. For example, men should wear suits, ties and the so on. In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show. It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group. Finally, on the last day we have an afternoon free. It would be grateful If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings. If you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you. I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Inventions have affected all our lives! Nowadays, a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days. A car is one of the invention which is very useful. I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially,  I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so on? In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes  long time to go somewhere. The car has largely affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than  use public transports. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand. I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car. In conclusion, I think  car is very important to me and it has affected my own life. If I have more money I will buy another car. I think it has more advantages than disadvantages. So, we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car! ",27.00
60," Dear Jane C I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival recently and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it. When I knew it was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small  that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all  events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money. Although that Festival was not well-organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls. I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  It is really nice to hearing from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other. Personally, I can not imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others. As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important  concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority . As a consequence, most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them. At home it is the other way about. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting friends , watching TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate with  house-keeping and meal. That is all! Hope you enjoy my experiences Best wishes ",31.00
121," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW THAT IS TAKING PART IN THE CIRCLE THEATRE. I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY. THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING. IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'. BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT. I THOUGHT IT WILL BE AT 19.30 AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN ADITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET. SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER. TO SUM UP, I DID NOT SPEND A PERFECT EVENING. I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD. ON THE WHOLE, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. YOURS FAITHFULLY MANUELA BELABARA  [SEP]  JUST BE YOURSELF IN, THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW. PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. ONE THE ONE HAND, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES. THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE. NOWADAYS, PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED. ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING, WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES. ON THE WHOLE, CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE. IN MY OPINION, PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR. THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT. ",27.0
292," Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite deceiving. I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre, are there about five points which were not respected. To begin with, as far as the starring is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed  the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceived, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favorite actor. Apart from it, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain  me the reasons of such a huge late? Thirdly, the ad mentionned possible discounts. Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a ""perfect evening out"" at all,  as it is mentionned in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you give me my money back. I am looking forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If only Paul had knew it before... Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience. He went through  valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone, on  top of which he could stare  the whole woods. All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words ""I am glad to meet you, Paul."" The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing. How did the beast knew his name? ""You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, in your reality!"" At these words, Paul suddently awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it. Unfortunately...one our after , a local zoo  arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because of  not having  Faerian food necessary to her survival. This is how human destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream. This is how mankind can't be relied on. This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result of it. ",35.0
614," Dear Helen Ryan I'm writing back to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me. If it's possible I would like to travel on July because of my job. I can't leave it until this month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of the year. As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer. I would like to stay in a tent because I'm used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too. It's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer. It's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography. I have never done noon of them before and as a result I can't be good  but I've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie. I also think that it would be great to learn  photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures. If you don't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are apropriate for the camp and for the weather of California. And also may I have to bring  money? because I know that all the costs are paid but it could be necessary for other things. I look forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely Luna Juarez.  [SEP]  I completely agree with the following statement: ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" From my point of view a lot of people believe that it's very fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true but in my opinion go shopping can be stressing and disgusting. First of all we usually go to the shops at the same time than the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled and it's impossible to try acurately. Secondly you have to thank before you come in a shop if you're going to have  luck. I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy. Thirdly you have to pray  to find the right size and once you've got it you have to think Does it fits me? And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a big amount of money or you will end  stressed, disgusted, and depressed. At last but not at least let me give you some advice try not to go with that friend of yours that is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will be awful. ",32.0
829," Dear Helen Ryan. My name is Agripina T. I just recive your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions. I would like to travel only on July because it's the only month when I'm free. On June I have to take some English lessons. I would prefer to live in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents. I don't really like living in tents. If it's possible to live in log cabins I'll be pleased. While I'm at the Camp, I would like to do two  favorite activities which are basketball and singing. I love to play basketball. I'm not good at it but I try my best. Before I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded  a lot. Also I like singing. In future I would like to be a singer. I like this kind of activity. There is something else I would like to ask. At the Camp, is there a free uniform or we will have to wear something spessial? Also I would like to ask about money. How much money should I take with me? And is it nesessary to bring money, will we need them? This is all what I wanted to ask. Thank you for everything. Yours sincerely  Agripina Tymoshenko.  [SEP]  I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons. From  activities I suggest to film sport lessons. and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always work, but us we work,  joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial. It's not true. We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math because they think that it's  boreing subject. I think it's all depends of  teacher. Our Math. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math. For activities we should film sport lessons because we always do something new. We do many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are speccial. We try to play on many instruments,  sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that. Report by Agripina Tymoshenko. ",26.0
308," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the show you presented two weeks ago at your theatre. As I was spending a week-end in London I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking  to have it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food . In conclusion, I would like to have the two tickets refunded considering also that there were no discounts available, as instead it was stated in the advertisement. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main cause of Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever teen-ager and while she was attending the Secondary School she had many troubles with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would have never passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 year-old but still well-looking and all my girls school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girls felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her class mate and she run away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any exitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign. The trial was long and had a wide coverage by  media. We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died terrified by the darkness which was nearing.

927," Dear Mrs. Ryan Before answering your letter (which I have just recieved) about the prize of the competition I recently won, I'd like to tell you thank you very much for giving me the chance of gong to the USA. It is just a dream come true! I have been asked to say when I would like travel. There's only one month for that: July (as I am working all the year round and I am not available to leave my job). About the accomodation; I rekon I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable. During my two week sat Camp California, I'd like to practice climbing and surfing, whose  basics I know perfectly well. I am quite good at both because I do usually practice them. Furthermore, I love to go through such sports! In addition to this, I would like to know the ammount of money I should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that I will find there. Don't hesitate to contact me if there's any problem, and thank you very much again. Yours sincerely, Bola  [SEP]  Hi Kim! How are you? It has been so long since I wrote to you for last time... Hey, guess what: I gave a hand to a friend at a pop concert! It was great, and I got my entrance for free! It happened by chance: I was walking down the street when I bumped into Jane, my old friend, who asked me if I wanted to join her and a couple of mates to help at the concert. I agreed unwillingly, as I couldn't imagine how a pop concert looked like... but when I came in I changed my mind! None of the groups were known nowadays, but I belive they are well on their way to becoming famous bands. My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff, and stay there after the concert to clean everything. This was the best part because when everyone was gone, Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginers!!! What was a fella like that doing in such a place? I couldn't belive my very eyes... Jane took a photograph of us toghether. I'll send you a copy as soon as I can. Lots of Kisses from Bola xxx ",33.0
421," Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I've seen on last Saturday. I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to  drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than  original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset much at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention about  that actor was going to change to another guy. This thing shouldn't be happened. After  finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised. It was about 21:00, I thought it was  bit later but it wasn't my falt anyway. The show was finished at 21:00. When I went there the restaurant was closed. We couldn't even get any sandwiches. I'm so upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show. I look forward to hearing from you before I do my futher reaction. Your faithfully Ann Kim.  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Nowadays, we have millions  styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion. Fashion became a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is  most important thing. We spend lots of time to choose clothes or shoes. A 100 years ago, people wear much more diffrently. Women worn dresses and men worn suits in England. It was very formal fashion, but now people wear more sexy clothes than 100 years ago. Fashion keeps changing. Therefore, in the future fashion might be changed a lot. I think people will wear metal clothes like  Robotcap. The enviroment will be very polluted and finally we'll get desease. We will need helmets to cover our head and we will also need air-supplyer. May be, science will be developed and make our enviroment clean,  we will not wear anything at all!!! (except under wear). I hope that the enviroment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be. We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in further days. ",24.0

I hope to give you, all the information  need and please, if you want more information or somenthing is not clear, please don't esitate to contact me again. The Hotel is near the station and is call ""Grand Placad"". When you arrived you take the train for Guildford and after  you have just across the road, in front of the station. It's  very confortable hotel where you can find everything you need. From there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50, that stop near the hotel and arrive in  town center. The conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to found it. At the end of  conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of  word and they could speak about their experience. I suggest for that conference to wear somenthing very confortable but elegant, the organisation want for all  boys wear  jacket,  the tie is not necessary. I don't know rely what you can see, three hours I think is not enough but near the station there is a beautiful garden popular for its variety of flowers. If I found somenthing special  to visit in three hours I call you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Ser or madam it is very nice of you to come and visit my town.

It was built on the top of the hill and around  there is only a huge field. You can arrive here wolking because the bus stop just on the bottom of the hill.

Firstly I can travel only in July because I'm studying at college until the end of June and in August I'm travelling  Greece for one months. Secondly I would like to stay in log cabins because it would be more spacious and comfortable than tents. I'll tell you  two activities I chose. I would like to play tennis and swim. I'm belonging to a tennis club and it is the most favourite sports. I sometimes have a match with friends. I go swimming once a week. I like swimming because I can relax in water. Lastly, could I ask you something? How is the weather like in California? Do I need clothes with long sleeves? How much money should I bring? Can I change money for US dollars there? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  'Shopping is not always enjoyable.' Is it true or not? Generally women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who  keen on finding stuffs which are good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowdy shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting. For the women, too. If they can't find things which they expected, they go there just only to get tired. Shopping is enjoyable when you find exactly what you want in a calm shop but not always. ",33.0

I recently booked a week's holiday in London to see the musical ""over the rainbow"" the date was the 9th of June 2000. from your firm. It was said that Danny Brook should play the leading part, but there was a different actor instead. This made me really disappointed. We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play should start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 then it started. It was also said that discounts was available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts. The theatre Restaurant that should be open after the show was closed because the chief was ill and there was no food in the fridge. This should have been our perfect evening out but it wasn't. I am not satisfied with this musical show at all. I am therefor writing to ask for a full refund I am expecting to receive a cheque for £20.

She realised that telling Pat was a very bad idea but now it was done. Pat was so happy the whole day and wanted to tell her mother but Maria told her not to. Maria was still a little bit chocked over the naus of having a baby. She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded. Many weeks went by and Maria and Pat didn't say a word about it. The rest of the family understood that something was wrong because Pat started to buy baby clothes.

978," Dear Misses RYAN I am writing to inquire whether there is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences about travel. Indeed I would rather to travel only on July since I'm going to work in august in order to earn money to pay  my studies next year. Moreover I would prefer being accommodate in  log cabins because I can't put up with mosquitos and other insects which risk coming into tents. Besides I've chosen two activities from the list: Tennis as I practice this sport regularly and I'm very good in this activity and Golf because I ignore all about this sport and I wish I will discover it thanks to you. On the other hand, I would obtain some details about the kind of clothes that I should carry with me and how much money to take You don't hesitate to contact me in order to have further information. I hope quickly hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear readers As you have already know, your English class is going to make a short video about daily life at your school, that's why I'm writing a report suggesting which, lessons and other activities, should be filmed. First of all, he seems obvious that we should, at least once, film a lesson with our English teacher who have had the idea to make this short video. Besides I would suggest filming a lunch to the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noises inside the restaurant because of  babbles. At the end, to my opinion, It would be interesting to film a course of sport in order that our parents realise that we improve our body's abilities, and not only our brain's abilities at school.

764," Dear Mrs. Ryan. I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize. It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July. I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is  for going with my parents to France. This has been scheduled 3 months ago. About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents. While I'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball, as I have been playing both sports all my life, and I have to say that I am very good at both. There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp. I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes. I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me. I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes  is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like. The Sports Shop. You cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is allways what we want. That's men's intention. Another point is to go  a big area. Specially  week-ends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to take a license to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out. In conclusion, for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all. ",32.0

In order to prepare this report I visited the business college and interviewed some students, I asked them only one question ""Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city?"" The Students, who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City. However the majority of people point out one a very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square. Most of the Students found this building very particular, because it reflects our history, tradition and culture. If you visit the building, you will get  impression,  feeling, that you are in  past times. This building attracts a lot of people, - because it has a very particular style with majestic, antique windows. In addition, I also visited this place - and I was very impressed.

495," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing in order to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' that recently took place in The Circle Theatre. During my prior holiday in London I came across an encourageing advertisment for the show and decided to see it. Unfortunately, I was very dissappointed to find out that there were no discounts available! Therefore, it cost me more money then usual. In addition, I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisment. My dissatisfaction became even bigger when I had realize that there had been a different actor than Danny Brook performing! Moreover, I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed due to redecoration! Having noticed that this was not 'a perfect evening out' I would like to ask for my money back. I feel as if I had been lied to and thus I demand my money to be returned. I am looking forward to receiving a response in the near future. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had already heard of me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation. This was the kind of association everybody knew of but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that telling aloud about  'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards. I guess it was that thrill that actually made me anxious to know what really was going on inside the dodgy-looking old house guarded by a man with an unfriendly hound. I've always enjoyed the hazard and this time getting the password was, indeed, a tough coockie. But knowing what these people are capable of makes me doubt wether to use it or not. Especially now, when 'big-mouth' Pat spread the news to litterally everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me. Therefore, I have to escape. What I've learned from this situation is to never trust people again. You should remember about this in the future. ",32.0
838," I am writing to thank  for the letter with the result of the competition and also to ask some questions. Firstly, I would like to inform  that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month. The reason for it, is that, July is the only month in which, I am on holidays so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer stay in  tents rather than stay in  log cabins because I appreciate having straight contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and  climbing I used to climb trees, walls everything in my childhood without falling. Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money would  be adviseable to take and what kind of clothe I should take. I look forward  an answer from you. Yours Faithfully Adriana  [SEP]  I am just writing to tell you about my experience about helping at a pop concert. Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have the unique opportunity to take  pictures  with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay  your ticket it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were not disadvantages. Kim, summing up it was the most interesting experience that I have ever had. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Lots of Love XXXXX Adriana ",34.0
320," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show that I saw in your theatre. First of all, Danny Brook was supposed to act there, but he was replaced by another actor. This situation made me feel very disappointed. Secondly, the show should have started at 19:30 p.m., and it began fourty-five minutes later. Moreover, when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were avaliable. Furthermore, I wanted to have a coffe after the show, but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant, it was closed. A police officer who was there told me that the manager of the restaurant was ill and that he didn't allowed anyone to open it. This was the worst night that I had during my stay in London. For all that reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money back to my house. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her school's class-matters were going to give their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise to her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden of Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That day afternoon they arrived at Paula's house in order to decorate the place. Ballons and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of delightful food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later all the things were finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they had been planned. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this. ",31.0
448," Dear Sir, I'm writting to complain about your theatre and its last night show. Firstly I would lice to say that I am very dissappointed with the show and that I didn't have the perfect evening out, as you had advertised. I have no idea from where to start. The main character of the musical show, which I'd like to say wasn't the ""BEST"", was awfull. His act was not good and he didn't seem like acting Even my son could act better. After the horrible act of your star, it comes the starting ours. I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I didn't. Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef and the waiters where on holiday. You could hire other  to do the work. I was very dissappointed what else can I write. It was suppose to be my perfect everning out. But it wasn't. I will ask  my money back. In Conclusion I'd like to recoment that you should, first, know what you have to offer and the advertising it. Yours sensirly Helena.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I shouldn't have told her that my dad had physcological problems. I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell it to my brother. It all started when I was about 10 years old, like my brother  now, and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems, to my aunt. I was hurt inside and cried till my tears run dry. I couldn't accept it. All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend. I was leaving in a lie. Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake  to say, this problem to my ""friend"" Pat. I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot, so I never thought that things could turn  like this. When, one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about the subject of my father and his problems. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was realy going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He stand outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised it, it was too late. The secret was revilied. And now I try to help my brother beaus I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels. ",28.0
364," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you, because I would like to disagree with your advertisment for the show 'over the Rainbow'. I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I  your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was  totally different actor. As it is said in  advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because by the programme it started at 20.15, but that was not the end of the story, in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets, that was not true! I was not still very disappointed, because I hoped that I will have a good meal with  glass of wine in the restaurant,  according to your advertisment but what did I  realised, it was closed, because the chef was in the hospital. I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money back. Yours faithfully, Sasha Comatova.  [SEP]  Everyday we keep in touch with technology. We have microwaves that help us to do our meal quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that made our life easier. I use different technological things everyday. Such as  mobile phone that helps me to communicate, with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home, I use  stereo, if I want to listen to my favourite music, I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, ect. I think that all these things made my life much easier. Many years ago people didn't have an oppotunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot. I am very happy that with all  technology that we have we don't have to work as much as they did,  like to wash plates and cups after meals, my dishwashing machine will do that for me, and I don't have to wash my clothes my washing machine does it better. Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over  humans and of course it makes me lazy. However now I have more freedom, free time, and privacy. ",28.0
727," Dear Helen Ryan, I have just read your letter and it would be grateful if you could give me more information about the two weeks at camp California in the USA. I am a nineteen year old gild who is still attending classes at Saint John's School. For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses about painting. I would appreciate  if I could travel on July because my school gives me two winter holiday's week. As far as accommodation is concern, I prefer staying in a long cabin. I believe it is better than a tent because this one would not shelter enough. As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years. I consider myself to be good at this sport. As regarding painting, I know a lot  since my grandmother taugh me when I was five years old. It would be very kind of you to let me know about the clothes you think it would be necessary for me to take and how much money I will need. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear kim, I'm sorry I haven't written to you before but I have been very busy helping at Mano''s concert. Do you remember when I told you that my dream was helping Mano''s group? Well, my dream come true. All started when I was in Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that Mano''s group were going to have a concert here, in Argentina. She also told me that she have some conections with the people in charge of the lights of the concert. You know that last year I organise the lights in our performance. So, there I was, controling the illumination in Mano's concert!!!! I will never forget that wonderful experience. This really help me for our next performance in the Drama Club. It was so exciting to see the Mano' group singer that I felt as if I were in heaven!! Please write  me as soon as you can. Best wishes, ",26.0
688," Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing as a reply to your letter, congratulating me to the winning of the first prize in your competition and inviting me to the Camp California in the U.S.A. I was delighted to hear from you and am already looking forward to spend two weeks in California. I am afraid that the only possible time for me to travel is in July because it is the only month I am able to get time off work. As an accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to the nature while camping a lot. The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing, which I have never done before and tennis which I already play quite well. I need to know how much money you would advise me to bring and what sort of clothes I should take with me. I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience and to get to know you personally in July. Yours faithfully, Esther Meyer  [SEP]  Dear Kim, thanks a lot for your long letter! It was great to hear from you again after such a long time. You asked me, how the pop concert was like which I told you I was going to go to in my last letter. Well, let me tell you, it was just awesome! My job was it, to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area. Therefore I got to stay backstage all the time and to see all the members of the ""Backstreet Boys"". And, you won't believe it, I actually got to talk to Nick Carter! Yes, that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience  to be part of the crew. I sort of felt, like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess. Do you know, what I mean? Anyway, I've got to study now, we've got a maths exam tomorrow. Hope to hear from you soon Lots of love, Esther ",38.0
1108," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to express my pleasure about the successful programme that you have prepared for our school, especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery. In addition, I would like to inform you about an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which my classmates and I have seen. We are really interested in  latest fashions and new hairstyles, but also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and  especially girls enjoy seeing the different kinds of making up. Furthermore, we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money. This event takes place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday on  14th of March. I would be grateful if you would consider my suggestion. If you agree to  visit  this exhibition, we will spend our day there, thus we should cancel the shopping, but we will be able to purchase some presents  next day, as you have not organised a specific plan. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to hit a human being and unfortunately, although I respect every form of life humans, animals and plants, I managed to hit a burglar. Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt at hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed. While I was listening to my favourite cassette, I heard a strange noise. Immediately I opened my door and... I could not believe my eyes! A short man stood in front of me! Without any warning he pushed my arms. I shouted as I pained. I realised that he was very strong. But I was faster and more intelligent than him. I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found one hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him. To my relief I managed to survive! ",34.00
644," Dear Helen Ryan I am replying in response of the competition I won. As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the travel. First of all, I would like to travel on July, because during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives. I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in  tents, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. For the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before, which is Sailing, so I am a totally begginer at this. The other activitie is Photography, I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera, all I want is to improve my knowledge. Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many  I should pack. Is there any place that I can wash my clothes? I also needed some information on the money I will take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all? I will be waiting  a reply. Your sincerely, Sara Todi  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything. But now I found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped . There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was ""Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking  and helping the most famous pop bands!"" I was so excited that I couldn't believe . When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice with me that it seemed we had known each others in ages! They weren't those kind of people that think they're gods. I helped them  organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars! That was so great! I don't know exactly how I felt, sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream. I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible. Best wishes, Sara ",33.0
821," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm very pleased to hearing from you, and I'm glad I've got this chance to go to the Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks. Firstly I must say that I'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since I started work and  intitled to have a holiday only in July. Secondly, I'd prefer to accommodate myself in one of the log cabins, as they are more comfortable, usually have central heating and other necessary facilities. Despite my appriciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I'd choose my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis. As I was a champion of  swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practice my skills. Also I like to play tennis, which is  beautiful ""game"" itself and good for  figure. In the conclusion I would like to ask if I need to take some money with me and how much? What kind of clothes will I need in the U.S.A. in July? Probably summer clothes mostly? Your sincerely, Hope to hear from you soon.  [SEP]  ""Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not"" - my English teacher has asked me on the class discussion about shopping. Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen of being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores. Despite  I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands, as prices are usually to high, unfortunately not affordable for me. Sometimes I go to the local market, but not on my own. I ask my husband or mother to come with me, as I had  bad experience in the past, when my bag with all my money was stolen. Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants which try to sale any products to the ""victim"" entring the door. Otherwise shopping is not so bad, as you get what you want in the end. ",32.0
1110," Dear Mr Robertson, I am a student of the English class. All my class mates are looking forward to go to London. Thank you so much for organising such a great program. I am writing  you about changing our plan on Tuesday 14 March. The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to the show. The advertisement saids it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm. Since the London Fashion and Leisure Show is not taken place so often and also they will offer the students for free entrance fee this time, if we joined in this show, it would be  great opportunity for us. For these reasons, we would like to suggest you to go to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon. I hope I will hear from you soon. I am sure that our travel is going to be great. Thank you very much Sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.  Otherwise I had to keep walking untill the train start. Have you stayed at a park during the night? When I did that, I was traveling around Japan. It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto. Although I intended to stay at  youth hostel, I could not find any place to stay, and also it was too late to buy a train ticket to go back home. It was a windy spring day. I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossam tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moon light helped me to see the things. I was regretting I risked staying at the park alone. Suddenly,  strong wind blew up the thousands and thousands  pieces of flowers. It was like a dream. I saw the pink colored snow there. Sometimes when we risk a great danger, it turns into a great experience.  ",30.00
770," Dear Mrs/Ms Ryan, I am writing  you because I would like to answer the information that you ask for. Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free in my job. It will be impossible  another choise, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think  is the best month to travel, the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons. Secondly, my choise is the accommodation in tents, I think it could be more interesting, I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside, in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like be at home. About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it, I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago, I felt really healthy. My other choise is painting, I paint since I was ten years old, I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class. A thing I would like ask is if I need special clothes, I don't know what kind of camp I am going . It should be a dry place, I think but I would like to make sure my guess, as well, I would like to know how much money I will need, because it is also all paid I don't know if there will be some gift shops. I look forward  hearing from you. Yours sincerely Patricia Reyes  [SEP]  - Shopping is not always enjoyable - The most popular ""sport"" that all the people do it's obiously shopping. This is the thing that move hundred and hundreds of people in the world and we don't have to go to Japan we have the evidences here in England. But the question is: Is shopping always enjoyable? Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewells, furnitures, etc. and you could have a real great time. But other people don't think like this, for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl get lost. The mother was shock, she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in the places, it was  nightmare but fortunaly the police found her. Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops? I don't thing that I'll enjoy it, all the people knicking you, you can't walk properly or buy something, and also there are  lot of cases which show how people can be in shops, I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where we are going!! In my opinion shopping is not the thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful,  too many people in the shops, so I prefer spend my free time go swimming or painting and I go shopping in the days that usually there are not too many people. ",25.0
285," Dear Sir, Re: The Musical Show Presented by the Circle Theatre With the reference of the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000, I, as a consumer, who is a musical show avid and a great fans of Danny Brook, who is said to be stared in the show, would like to complain about the presentation. 1. First of all, I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook. whose name was stated on the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be. 2. The Price of the ticket was said that there would be discounts available. However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show. 3. I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to the shortage of food sold. I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off. With all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return. I would consider to bring this complains to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explaination from the theatre. Thank You. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss about in the past, now and also in the future. However, things re recycling from time to time. So do the objective of wearing clothes. I will imagine that, people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past. The people in the past wear clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind. On the other hand, the people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is  result of a developed and full-grown country. I think people in the future will likely to wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided. It is because of the increasing number of  population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere. They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective. All the above ideas are needed to make them bare no burden when wearing these special designed clothes. The future is a hope and a dream for everyone in the earth. Therefore, I will suggest that we all nov to keep the enviroment clean and healthy for the next generation. ",29.0

I am really excited to travel at Camp California in the USA because I like to know people of other countries. As I only have holidays on July I would like to travel on this month. I would prefer to have accommodation in  log cabins because I like to be comfortable and I don't like to be lied down on the floor inside a tent. I would like to play basketball because I love this game. I used to play when I was at high school. I think that I am a very competitive player, as well or a  technical player.

As you know I love irish music so I was very happy when the organisers of the concert phone me to help them. The organisers paid for my acommodation and travel to Ireland. I arrived at Ireland on 2th July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to built the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened  irish music and suddenly we saw to U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us. I could speak to my favourite singer 'Bono', I could meet him and I helped him to repair his guitar because it didn't sound very well. The rest of the days I wasn't doing anything especial, just I helped to organise the rehearsals of the differents group who were going to play in the concert. Best wishes, ",29.0
239," Dear Sir, I am writing to you to complain about the show which I saw last Friday at your theatre. The show was called 'Over the rainbow' I was not pleased with the way that  was set out. First of all, when I went and bought my ticket, there was no discount but in your advertisement it said clearly that discounts are available and as a result my ticket  was bought  more expensive. Secondly, the show I went  was the evening one, which was supposed to start at 7:30 p.m. but it had a 41 minutes delay and  ended up starting at 8.15 p.m. Furthermore, the original actor was Danny Brook but it changed to a different actor which acted terribly and was very disappointing. Last of all, it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant  after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was redecorating and no annocement was made. I didn't have a perfect evening out and instead I had a awful evening out. Therefore I would like are refund of my ticket and I would like a apolygists. Thank you from you Your Sincelery,   [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think modles will wear in  cat walks? Will they wear anything? Who know? Nowaday, people look at fashion-magesins or get opinions from their friends  to decide what to wear in different occasions Will they still do the same 100 years later? In my opinion, I think clothes will be a lot differente  100 years later compare to now. As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves which leads to changes in fashion but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America. and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material. If you walk out  to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans which is incredibly surprising! From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular. As people are wearing thinner and thinner clothings to show off their figure They might as well just wear clothes that are see through to give it a better effect! so if you want to know what clothes will be like 100 year later, the only thing you can do is to WAIT!

462," Dear Sir/Madam During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre. I found your advertisement in the tourism officis and how the musical ""Over the rainbow"" seemed to be a good option I choose it. The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed  a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm  student but I paid  a full ticket). How it was explained above, I'm not satisfied and I want to be   refund. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend which is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot. We'll understand why I'm writing in the past. Last weekend we diced to go to the bach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend). When we arrived there Eingrid and Pat decided to take a sunbath while I and Nik walked in the sand. Lyter a long time walking we decided to return and how the weather was so hot we  found a place to drink something. Then I found an ex-girlfriend that Eingrid hates. We had a little conversation and suddenly she kissed me, but I refused to continue. I called Nick to go search  the girls (he was in the WC) and said goodbye to she. When we met the girls Eingrid was furious, she said  me that Pat had saw me kissing another girl and our relationship was over! I'm really very unlucked.  ",26.0
511," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my great disappointment about the musical show I attended in your theatre last weekend. According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisinggly, it  was proformed by a different actor  who I even didn't know the name. In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half  hour later, until 20:15. To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no any discount available. The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night. You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening. I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on  some money back. I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Nowadays, we use a lot of modern technology both at home and   office but it has its aventage and disaventage. The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier, for instance  ricer cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch  on, it makes cooking more effeciently. Furthmore, we can use  computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want. It is often suggested that, modern technology makes the gap bigger between peoples, they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings. To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not alway rely on it. ",24.0
788," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I'm writting to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that Camp. I'm going to give you all the information you need from me. I only can travel I July, because it is when I stop playing basketball to rest before starting the new season. I don't mind staying wherever you want me to. However, I prefer log cabins to tents. They're more comfortable. According to the activities I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal  me much, but I'm quite good at Golf. I like surfing and playing tennis,  such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it. there'are no more questions. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I'm writting to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday. It was such a beautiful night! Unforgetable. I had always dreamt of being near ""The Cranberies"", but I had never thought that the dream could became reallity. During the afternoon, Tim and me spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held. AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there for starting queueing. We bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest. After a few minutes the dream happened: Kare - the guitarrist - appeared over there. At first we both thought we were dreaming but when we realised it was true we went there and ask him some questions. And then we bring his guitar for him. It was great to help him. Finally he said how thankful he was and alowed us to stay with them till the concert started. That's all. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Aladdin ",30.0
756," Dear Helen Ryan As you mentioned that I have won the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.  therefore here is the information that you require. I can travel only in July because during this month I am free to go anywhere, actually it is my summer holiday. Apart from that I wouldn't mind at all whether  to stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because it gives me a nice feeling and relaxation, it is very unusal for me to stay in log cabins while you are camping. The activities that I'd like to do: First one it would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well due to I used to be a basketball player in my high school. Second activity it would be tennis, I am not the expert in this one because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like ; serve the ball, back hand and fore hand to hit the ball. Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one tents? Do I have to bring swimming suit if I want to swim in the camp? How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay ? This information should  enough for you but if you'd like to know more about anything please ask me and do not hesitate. I'm looking forward to it and I hope seeing you during this summer. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Sometime when you ask your friend especially girls. What would you like to  after the class or during the weekend? The typical answer would be 'I'm going to  shop because I like it even windows shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it's wasting my time especially when I can't find the thing I want, this is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all  your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime. However shopping is not a bad thing, only if you plan it carefully what to buy, where to go, how much money you will spend on? ",25.0
583," Dear Mrs Helen, I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you giving me. Fist of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is  hotest mounth in the year, and the weather shall be really nice. Secondly, I think it is would be better to stay  tents, so than we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play in. However, as you asked me to choose two activities, I'm choosing swimming and climbing, because I'm very good at swimming and I would like to try myself at climbing. Despite the small expereance in climbing I do want to try this type of sport. In addition, I would like to know how much money do I have to bring with me. I think that it is all what I would like to know. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to suggest wich lessons and other activities should be filmed. I have enterwed each student from my English class. Fistly, the English lesson must be filmed as the most interesting lesson at our school because it will give to students an interest  to study and improve their noleges. Also you can have a good practice with English with students, who came from different countries. ",18.0
1154," Dear Maria Smith, First of all, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel. It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people. It has a swimming-pool and a nice bar. The hotel is ten minutes far from the conference  and there will be a bus available to go directly over there. At the end of the conference, there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes; jean's is not allowed. Next to the restaurant, there is a disco for people who like dancing. We can do a lot of things in my area. We have the possibility to visit the old town, it's very nice and there is a lot of shops. We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too.  [SEP]  I find television the most important invention. I think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore. In one hand it's because they have not enough money to pay  it and in the other hand it's because they can't move very well for example if they are disabled. With television, old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore. Television is a good way to be informed with the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers, it's more relaxing. I think television is a good invention for children  when they have free time and while they are watching television, we don't have to look after them if we have something important to do. ",26.00
1072," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you inconnection with your programme of spending three days in London. I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March at 10.00 - 19.00. I would be greatful if you could arrange these shows in your programme. It is very thoughtful of you that you are taking all of us to London. This is  great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself especially, The London fashion and leisure shows. Most of the shows are about fashinable things for the students in my age. I think it is a good programme and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of the shows for instance  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to make up and how to have propiate hairstyles. In my opionion, I think you should organised this programme in the afternoon instead of going for shopping and move the shoping time in the afternoon on Wednesday. I hope this information will help you to understand and put it in your programme. I trust you to pay immidiate attention to my suggestions. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I closed my eyes, tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower. There were hundrend of Thai students were waiting for doing this test. I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous. I was given the lists for doing the activities while I was going to the adventurous school schems at the solder camps in the north of Thailand. There were many tasks that I had to complete for instance, clime up to the mountain,  how to used some kind of guns, and how to survive when I got lost in the forest. The last task I had to do was jume out of the hight tower. The assistants were the real solder and they were very kind and helpful eventhough, they looked very strick and unkind. It was the hardest time for me to do thing like this because I lived in the city most of my life  I had never known about how to survive in the forest and how difficult to work as solders. I eventaully managed to complete all  tasks that I had given  I was very proud of this. ",24.00
1225," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am glad to help you for the organisation of the conference. I phoned to the tourist information  last week and I got some information about the accomodation of the students. I think we should book at the Palace Hotel. It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre. The Hotel is in a good position, 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is on foot. I am sure the students will enjoy walking in the streets of the town. The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7 pm. I think they should wear smart dress, because there will be lots of interesting people and  important meeting. In conclusion, for the last day, I thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art. On the other hand, if you prefer to have a relaxing day, you could have a pic-nic in the wonderful park. I hope my suggestion and Idea will help you to organise the meeting. I look forward to receiving your confirmation.

361," Dear Sir! I am writing to you because of the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" I saw in your theatre last week. I looked forward  a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had. Firstly, you did not tell the truth about  starring. The advertisement of the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook, unfortunately there was someone else - an actor which I do not like and if I have known that he was going to be  I woud not have come to see him. Secondly, it was supposed to start at 19.30 but  actually started at 20.15. Forty five minutes later! You also have mentioned about the discounts and there were not any. Lastly, the restaurant which was going to be opened was in fact closed without a reason ! Keeping in mind all these arguments, I want to ask you for some money back. I think it could be your nice apologise for all my problems and disappointments. Your faithfuly,  [SEP]  Contemporary modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives. It is always with us: in our homes, in the places we work and learn. It affects our lifes, my too. In fact modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life rapidly. But I am also sure, that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me since the very beging of my day. For example I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water, next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the ideas of the technology. On the other hand, I am aware of all these disadvantages of the modern technology; pollution and  dangarous it brings. But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K. I am really glad that I am a child of my centuary - the age of modern science. Finally, I think that we cannot talk only about  changes which the modern technology has brought to our lives. That's because that I think that we are the one who change the technology as well. I think that our lives are lives with technology, they sometimes mean the same as science and affects not on at each other but together. So how has the modern technology changed my daily life? I don't know how it would be like without the technology. ",30.0
844," Dear Helen, I learnt from you letter that I've won the first prize. I felt how luck I was. I understood you want to know when am I available to set off and where I'd like to stay. First of all I will be able to go   U.S.A  in July because of my university. I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays. My exams will have finished at the end of June. I will only be able to set off in July and I also will give my thesis to my teacher in August. This holiday will help me to think   and prepare it. I'd prefer staying in  log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study . Basically, I don't like staying in a small tent. When I get  the camp, I'd like to swim and climb. I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing. I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer. I'd like to ask some questions  which I want to know. Is there any toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby? Do I have to bring any special clothes? Do you have any idea what is the weather going to be ? How much mone do you recommend me to bring with me? Is the camp close to  town or city? Will you provide me  an instructor when I climb and swim? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I haven't written  you for ages. I do apologise for this. How are you? How is your new school and  parents? I hope we can catch up with each other's news. Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert. It was unbelievable and tiring as well. I saw all the pop bands and singers. I heard them talking behind the stage. They signed my diary and took a photo with me. Being a security guard was the hardest task. Carrying big speakers  place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh. Believe it or not I put make up on one famous singer's face. I was just walking down by  dressing room   manager said that if I could help them. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was in her room and helping her. Especially I liked that time. I advise you to do something like that. I'm going to help them again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, ",32.0
938," Dear Sir or Madame, I'm so glad to get the news I've won the prize. Many thanks for giving me a chance to stay at the Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I could leave for the camp in July. Because I'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth, England until June and then I'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip. We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling. So I can go to the camp in the middle of the July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I've had unpleasant experience from my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent. In addition as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin. Most of all, I'm so happy that I could choose some activities. I'd like to practice golf and tennis. Both of them are my favorite sports and I'm quite good. I think I should ask you about something more. How's the weather there? Which kind of clothes  I have to bring and how much money I will need? Could you tell me about them? I'll be grateful if you could send me further information. I'll look forward to your reply.  Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  When I was asked what I do in my free time, I've never hesitated to say, ""I enjoy going shopping."" I'm very extroverted. So I like spend my energy doing sports or some kinds of energetic activity. I thought going shopping was suitable for me. Especially when I visit somewhere for the first time or I have nothing to do, but lots of time, I naturally and automatically look for a decent shopping centre. But nowadays I found shopping is not always enjoyable. Since I started living in England, I've worked two part time jobs as a cleaner. I can't make enough money for my living expense. I have to control my expenses on the budget. It's not easy for me, as I used to depend on my parents before I came here.  Anyway I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets. What makes me desperate is a nice summer dress I've found in a department store. I really wanted to buy it, but I couldn't afford to buy it. I realised that shopping is not always enjoyable. ",30.0

I would like to travel in July because it is  school holliday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel, so I have no preference for the weeks. I don't mind staying in log cabins, but I prefer camping because I want to be really near the nature. Well, about the activities, I love Photography, I made a course and I would like to take beautiful photos of the Camp. And I always was good at swimming, now I'll be at the Camp during the summer I think it is a good idea. I don't know how much money I'll need to the trip and what kind of clothes I'll need. Do you have any night plan, like going to discos or night clubs? Can you give  this informations? I'm looking forward to receving your letter. Your sincerely Daniela.  [SEP]  Nowadays shopping is one of the activities that makes our society lives. The cities are the main commercial centre, our streets are full of billboard advertising many things  and. Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable, when you need to buy something you have to look for the best price, what is always a work of time, and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper, it must be crowded. The solution can be in a alternative way of making shops like  Internet. You can by anything without  problem, this is a good thing although this prevents poor people from shopping by  Internet, because you have to have a computer. Anyway, other alternatives of shopping are being created and we can choose for not waste our time shopping. ",26.0

149," 17 May 2000 Dear Sir or Mam, Last weak, I went to London to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". I was realy happy to see the ""Best Musical Show"" in London. But what I saw was exactly the opposite  I expected. In other words, it was a disaster. Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why  were no discounts avaivable? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors  which were not very good in acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed. It wasn't realy a perfect evening like you promised on your flyer. I was very disapointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was. Yours faithfully, Franz Morell Hand  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Unfortunately, modern technology made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for  holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need. Every production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for  worker anymore. Every thing is controlled and produced by machines. This also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to. You never get bored. ",28.0
958," 13 of June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan: I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permition from my work. At the same time, on july is my birthday, so it would be nice to celebrated  there. I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent, couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girl. Sleeping in  tent is much more exiting and clousy than  a log cabin. At the camp I will like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing, I love painting, in the university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby.

I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires. Thankeaw for givin me this oportunity. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: You are never going to believe what I did last month I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when sudently a man stop us saying that he was looking for people to help in a concert and they was going to pay us five pounds an hour. We sed yes inmidiatly, I nearly shouted of happines when they told us that, Luis Miguel was doing the concert, he is my favorite singer. The concert was on a sunday and we had to work on the back of the stadge, doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people that was working there. We was so close to him, I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind, I will never forget that day. Since then, me and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day. I hop you write  me soon to tall me youre opinion. lots of love ",25.0
1235," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I have received your letter and I am glad I can help you. You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is  ; once you have gone out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just by our college. When you are in the college ask for me. The conference will take one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start, it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff. The dress code is: no jeans. We will prove you with food and drinks. For your free hours I have quite a few ideas. There are lots of things to do here. We have got a museum which is just at two minutes from your hotel. You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café. If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that. I hope this information will be helpful. If you have any other questions, please, do contact me. Looking forward to seeing you soon. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  THE MOBILE PHONE The mobile phone has completely changed our lives, it is an instrument which I cannot imagine myself living without. Apart from being in-fashion it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it? Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone. I am fifteen years old and everybody in my year has got a mobile phone. Five years ago you wouldn't have even thought about it. It has been a plus for me. For example, now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile with me, and, sending text messages is an addiction which every teenager is obsessed with. All over, the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone. ",38.00
576," 14.06.2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very glad I won the competition. This trip will, undoubtedly be a wonderful experience. As far as the dates of travelling are concerned, the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the remaining  summer. I really didn't expect to win the trip. I would therefore be very thankful if you could book the tickets for then. Concerning the accommodation choice you have proposed me, please make sure I am sleeping in a tent, as I have never experienced open air camping before. I think it would be nice to try it at least once. Concerning the proposed activities please, accept me for Singing and Painting. The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad. Concerning Singing activities, I think I'm quite good as I have been in my school's choir for 3 years. Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  17 October 2000 Dear Kim, As you asked me, I write  you about my experience at the Pop Concert. Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big stress about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people. There were 963 persons in the ""Armaggedon"" that night! But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other way to meet the ""New Bentley"" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one  I shared a meal with Paul McPartney. I'm sure you are jalous now. Don't worry they still organise these ""youth work"" programs. With love John ",32.0
453," Dear manager I am writing  you because of your new musical show ""Over The Rainbow''. I have spent my holiday in London recently and it is like a tradition, we went to a musical. After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it. But firstly when we bought our tickets, we didn't get any discount, we had to pay the full price. And then the show started at 20:15 p.m., although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m., so we've had to wait quite long in this crowded room. And when the show finally started, I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting, instead there was an unknown, not very talented actor. After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant, because we were very hungry, but then we saw that it was closed, because of staff illness. I would like to ask you to give us our money back, because it has been a very disappointing evening for us. Yours sincerely, Sara Schmidt  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We sometimes tried to make surprise parties, but it never worked because of him. Two weeks before his birthday he started asking us what we were gong to do. That annoyed us so much, that we started making something up. We told Pat we couldn't have a party on his birthday, because everyone except me had something to do. Of course, that wasn't , we had actually organised a party for him with all his friends since a long time go, but he wasn't supposed to know that. On his birthday all our friends were at my place, waiting for Pat. I had invited him to opened the evening with me. But half an hour before he should have been there he phoned me and said he was too tired to come. I couldn't change his mind although I've tried everything. In the end I just told him the truth. He was very sorry that he had not want to come and arrived quite soon then. But I know now, that it is always better not to lie even if it should be for  good . ",33.0

First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four weeks vacation on July. I would like to travel on July. Secondly, for me, the best way to live in  outdoor is in tents, because that will be a good chance to learn a lot of knowledge about  planets and  animals as well. Moreover, I am good at play basketball, in fact, I am the captain in  basketball team which is one of the best teenagers team in my city, and I also like singing. I play piano very well. Two of my friends and I have a band, we sometimes perform in my school club. Could you tell me something about  clothes and money which is I need to take with me. I look forward to hearing from you.

328," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to give my opinion about the musical show called ""Over the Rainbow"". I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". To tell the truth, it was a very disappointing evening. When I read the advertisement first, I thought that it would be fun. In the advertisement, it was written that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing. The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15. Which means, I had to wait there for 45 minutes. And also, it was written that the discounts were available but they were not. After the show, I decided to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. On the door, there was a note saying that the restaurant was closed because of the illness of the cook. I had given £20 and now, I would be pleased if you give some of my money back. It was a terrible evening out for me. I hope the next musical show would be a better one. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  MODERN TECHNOLOGY In the past, everything was very different. People had completely different life-styles. People were using candles to see around them. In winter, they used to fire some woods to keep warm, ""Computer"" was a word that nobody had known the meaning of it. As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-and white. Their hobies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything. Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We are using mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or on a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every section of our lives. We also have  ""internet"", by which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute. Modern technology is very important for all the countries. It has a very big role in developing a country. When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used in everything. I think, we are all very lucky people that we aren't using candles or black and white televisions anymore? ",32.0
1190," Dear Mrs Smith I have received your letter, which was about that you would like me to inform you. As you know, a hotel whose name is  Palace Hotel has been booked for your group. The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi. I am afraid there are no buses to get there. We will have a great party at the end of the conference. The party will be formal, therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress. As you know, it is not suitable to wear a jean or something . On your last day you have an afternoon free. In my area there is a fantastic park, which is the most famous park in the country. You can find a lot of things to do or to see. You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park. I hope you will find all the details, which you would like to have in the letter. If you need any  information, please let me know. Your Sincerely,  [SEP]   Power Of Computurs. How much can a computer affect your life? I think it effects  more than you think. When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked, but it was nearly impossible to have them. I felt  lack of them. I first bought a computer as I was in university. It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer.  That time I met the magic world of computers. Linking to the internet was so popular.  Internet was something amazing for me. Can you think you have every   information you need whenever you want ? Can you think you  contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ? I meet a lot of people on  internet and it really interest me. I learn a lot about their culture by speaking  them on  internet. I wasn't able to imagine this before. In addition  this, today companies can do nothing without a computer. Everything in this world works with computers from now on. Computers changed my life style, my opinion about the world. And they effect everyone's life directly or indirectly. ",26.00
23," Dear Mrs or Miss Jane X, I am writing to thank you for the annual international arts festival which was organized on 21st-22nd November. I had spent at this festival for two days. It was a great idea to organize such  festival. I am a teacher and I love music. Most of the events which I had seen were good. I enjoyed  dance shows,  jazz and rock concerts. I visited art exhibitions. There were a lot of nice pictures, sculptures and other creative works. I was impressed by them. At  festival I could talk with writers. It was an excellent idea to make one reasonaly-priced weekend ticket for all events. A lot of people could visit as many events as the they could. I was very surprised when I knew that  stars and artists were only from six countries. It was too little for this festival. It was  pitty that too small halls were used for  classical concerts. I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sounds of  music were terrible. I have some suggestion for next year's festival. Firstly, it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands. The second one is to include more musical films and plays. I would like to help you in your interesting job. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Traditional Folk Stories of the World There are a lot of folk stories in the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia, I would like to tell you one of them. This story is about a man and his three sons. This story happened a long time ago. The man was old and his sons were young. One day the man quarreled with his sons and they left the house trying to find work. They were successful. And they had lived far from their father for two years. They grow up and became wise. They decided to return to his father because he was old and he needed help. When the sons were old they began to tell about their life beginning with this story happend a long time ago ",32.00
1039," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised. All  students are very pleased and we are looking forward to go to London. We know we are going for  three days, but we'll have enough time to use one of the bigger city in the world. London is the place to be when  always something happening. We  all very happy with your programme, especially we like the idea of  sightseeing by our and  National Art Gallery. The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show,  we would like to ask you if  is possible to make some changes in the programme? The show is on Tuesday the 14th between 10.00-  13.00. We think  is the great opportunity to see  latest fashion,  find  about make up and hairstyles. And all of it is free, According to your programme we have the science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping. Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then  for the shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday? All  students will be very greatful . your sincerly  [SEP]  I think for all of us home is something which is a very important. Home sweet home. We call home the place where we live or the country where we come frome. Anyway home is always the place to go because  is ours we feel save and comfortable . Home sweet home. After hard work we want to go home to have our corner where we are all able to rest and relax. I think in the future home might be just the place to go to sleep. We live in the very busy world! Working long hours, doing plenty of activieties, going out, going on holidays. We even don't spend time with  families. Propably in the future we might be to busy to go to our own home and spend some time there. But in the end of the day it alway will be  place to go! We find our family there and our life. Some of us have been living in  one house since they were born. We are sentimental and we have memory from the past. I think it's a part of our life.lf ",29.00
947," Dear Mrs Ryan, I received your letter last week and I would like to thank you very much. I was really surprised and happy to hear that I won the first prize On your letter you ask me some questions about my wishes: First of all, I would prefer travelling during the month of July, because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August. Secondly, I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I am  very active person who loves the outdoor life. Thirdly, I am keen on sailing and I have been lucky enough to practice this sport, moreover, I passed my licence last year in Port Camargue in France so it means that I can teach this sport. I also choose the Golf I have never played this sport but I am sure I will enjoy it. Would you be kind enough to tell  if I need  special clothes or equipment? Furthermore could you give me an idea about the pocket money I need? Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information about me. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Brigitte Bourgeois  [SEP]  From: Brigitte Bourgeois To: Mrs Darley - teacher Subject: short video about daily life at our school. The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order, to prepare this report I visited in many occasions the classrooms and talked to the students and teachers. It seems to me that it will be a nice idea to show our library because according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well-used, moreover the range of books and newspapers is very large and useful. The students mentionned that it would be very interessting to show the English course because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to discover  our English course. To sum up, I would suggest to film our library because it is a pleasant place that students really like and the English course which will help foreign students for their future choice. ",36.0
294," Mr./Mrs Manager, I am writing to complain about a musical show I went  one week ago. Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour. To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts  as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy  the cheapest and worst seat available. As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance. I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the £10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame. Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Well, it's pretty simple to answer this. Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer, I didn't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games. The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and  evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them, I kept on stucked in front of the screen. Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC. After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed. I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web. My daily life would be harder without modern technology. ",35.0
892," June, the 13th 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, You can guess how an enjoyable surprise receiving your letter was for me. I am glad to send you the items required. First of all, I must precise that I can only leave during the month of July owing to the job I obtained for August. After considering your accomodation offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible. I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping, however I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort two weeks long. Moreover, I must recognize that the activities offered are really attractive so it's hard to make up my mind. On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during  leisure times. Even if the photograph made are modest work, I am really interested in this activity. Then, as low  my level of   basketball is, I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time. So it will be pleasant for me to practice this activity. Your letter indicates that the pride includes that some costs are paid. Nevertheless I would like you to precise what I eventually need for this travel. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  What obviously appears about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes. Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times that make our life. To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown at first. It evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché; that can not lack. A philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it. Next, students during the pause in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with   the classroom atmosphear but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video. Furthermore two moments could have a role. First of all, the arrive of every students, namely the picture of the school without anybody at first, and then with the crowd of students increasing gradually is typical of its life. Then, the opposite situation, that is to say the scene of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can make a parallel. ",25.0
645," Dear Madam, I am very happy to hear that I've won first prize in your competition. Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for. I would like to travel in July. I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best. As for accomodation I would prefer log cabins, because I belive they are more comfortable then tents. The activities I would like to do during my stay are golf and surfing. I never tried those sports, because they are quite expensive. I have two questions. Could you tell me what are the weather conditions in California at that time of year, because I want to know what clothes to take. Am I supposed to take an outfit for sports as well? The other question is about money. Will I be given any pocket-money or do I need to bring my own money to cover additional expences? Yours sincerely Adalbert Turnau  [SEP]  First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is  great idea. Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there. I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic. To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film. Below are my suggestions of what should be filmed. The first thing to be filmed is our English lesson, because our teacher Mr. S. has a lot of weird ideas and we could get a lot of fun moments on tape. The chemistry lesson should be filmed because we do a lot of interesting experiments there. The computer class can be also there, because program and internet surfing is quite interesting. As for other activities, there is a Jiu-Jitsu class after regular lessons. Martial arts are realy exciting and are a great thing to film. ",31.0
1031," Dear Mr. Robertson, I was asked by my class to write to you. First of all, we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three days trip to London. Indeed, we are especially interested in the sightseeing  by bus. The river trip to Greenwich is also a marvellous idea! Moreover, we couldn't go there without visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. However, could we make a suggestion? Having seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th, we would particularly like to go and visit it. How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for it! Besides, as there are more girls than boys in the class, they would certainly enjoy attending on live make-up and hairstyles. Lastly, it is free for students, which is fantastic! So, instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, we might go to the Show. We may go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, as we should have had  freetime. What do you think of this suggestion? We are looking forward to receiving your reply. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  For famous people, having a private life is difficult, especially because we are all interested in their lives. On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television. On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what we often forget they are.  ",40.00

For accommodation I would rather go in a tent, I want to enjoy  wild life and admire the landscape. In relation with leisure activities, my favourites are Basketball, which I have been playing for two years because I have been selected for my University team and I think a time practising with players from different countries will help me develop my skills at  international level. Secondly, I would like to practise tennis, which is my hobby and I think it helps my mind to keep working. I would like to ask you how much money do I need, how is the weather in order to pack the necessary clothe and wheter I need something else. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Kim: What a fantastic experience I had helping my favourite group! You wouldn't believe it! I was working helping to mantle and dismantle the stage, sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something on the microphone, that was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sand in  duo with the vocalist of the group, it was such a great fun! But the most exciting part of my job, and the one that I was looking forward to, was the last night of  concert, because all the staff were promised to have a party with all the members of the band. That night was the best of my entire life. I send you some pictures, the best ones  because there were some quite embarrasing . I hope you like them and I am already waiting for your next letter.

388," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre. According to the advertisement, one of the actor who had to show was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another disappointing actor instead of him. By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it had to start at 19:30: it wasn't in late, it was to much in late. We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for. And what's more, there weren't  discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff. Well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I pretend to have my money back, I waisted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programm I payed for. Looking forward to hearing from you soon Your sincerely  [SEP]  Science and technology have changed man's life: that's true, I don't need to look  how they affect the lives of the others, I have only to see how they have changed my life. Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that  borns from the technology. Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something  intersts you. But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed: in my mind all must be in order like in a CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of  mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take part of my life. In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in order to meet new people, to speak with them  to have a contact with the ""human world"". Am I crazy? No, I'm only a daughter of the technology. Yesterday my grandmother asked me what will I do without the computer. I answered to her saying I probably will die. ",31.0

We will be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday's afternoon. We have checked that it is open every day. As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be  nice prize for our work during this year. I would b grateful if you  consider our suggestions. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was night and I was alone in my house. Suddenly I heard a noice from my garden and I wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it. The outside lights were broken down and I couldn't see anything. My dog was very angry. I was affraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get to my house. After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen's window. I was very frethend, but I knew, that I should do something. I had no time to call someone and I had to go to my kitchen to check what it was. I stood against the window and I started to listen. I was shure there were someone on the other side of the wall. It was terrible, I thought that it was the last day of my life. Suddenly someone broke my window. I had no time to think, I kept one of the pots and hit him in his head. One moment later I called  police. He was a thief, who were looked for for many years. ",31.00
456," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about The Circle Theatre which is very different from what it have shown. I will let you know about what I have in mind. I went to your theatre last saturday,  about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts. But a clerk said that  time for discounts had been finished. I did not care about  money and I rushed into  and then took a seat with some food. I was waiting for the show that was supposed to start at 7.30 p.m. But it started at 8.15. I felt nervous. When I saw an actor, he was a different actor. I was very upset and disappointed. After the show ended, I was on the way to the theatre restaurant. What was more, it closed because of refurishing. If you were me, how would you feel? So, I could not help to writing to you and would like to take money back. I enclosed the receipt of theatre. Yours faithfully, Bying Kak  [SEP]  - How has modern technology changed your daily life? I was born in 1973. At this time, our nation was under a developing country. Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our county very quickly. As I growed up, T.V was one of the mysteriest things like a telephone and a bus. When it comes to modern technology, I grately appreciate it. First thing is a computer. When I was a university student, I had to find out some imformation about my homework. I could not get them. but a computer made me get them from  internet. Second thing is an airplane. I have been imagining where another contries are like England. Now I am in England. I know a ship but an airplane made an arrival to here be quick. Third thing is a telephone. It saves time. Whenever I do not know about something, I phone  and ask  it. All in all, I have been having many benefits from modern technology which is very useful. But it might be a problem, making me lazy. Now, the world is one end and I have to take advantage of modern technology for my future. ",20.0
620," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I am writing in response of your questions. I can travel only in july because  is the only month of this year that I will be available because I finish school in june so I will be very busy  and in August I start to study at the University, so july is the best month for me to travel. Accommodation for me is not  problem. I am very easy going and I will be satisfied wherever . But if I have to choose, I prefer sleep in tents, because when I travel I usually sleep in that kind of accommodation so, for me they seem very comfortable. I would like to do the following activities: - Tennis because  is my favourite sport and I enjoy playing it. I play tennis since I was a child and I have won some competitions in my town so I think I play very well. - Climbing because I have never climbed in my life and it is a dream for me to do that. I am a terrible climber but with a little bit of help I think I can enjoy the activity and have a good time  unforgettable. I wonder to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in  U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring to the trip. I am looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello Kim: Thank you for your letter it was great to hear from you. Sorry but I haven't written  you because I've been very busy. Last month I helped at a pop concert, it was marvellous. I have a friend and she knows that I speak English so she offered to me work with an English singer so I said ""yes, of course"". But you can't imagine who was the singer, it was Sting, can you imagine? You know, he is my favourite singer. My job was very easy I had to help Sting in everything, for example if he wanted water, I had to give to him water, it was marvellous. He was very kind to me, we talked  many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have a dinner, yes I know what you're thinking, ""Dinner and Sting"" yes my friend it was the best thing  in my life. I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoken very well English. The best thing was I spoke in English because I was forgetting it and I met my favourite singer. I hope my friend call me again to work  because I had a wonderful time and it was a great and unforgettable experience. I hope you are O.K. and write soon. Lots of Love P.D. I send you an autograph that Sting wrote for you. ",29.0
393," Dear manager, My name is German Schmidt an in the last week I went in your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There are some problems, we have to speak about. At first, the actor was not Danny Brook there was a different actor, who I don't know. In the advertisement of the show  was written that the musical will be start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. After the musical show I want to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are in holidays. And this  not  perfect evening in your theatre was very expensive for me. I've payed £ 160 for eight people and there was no discounts available. In my oppinion you have to give some money back to me. I think 50% (£80) are enough. If you give no money back, I will go to the newspaper. faithfully  [SEP]  At first I would say that our technology level, in this  time are very high but in the future it would be higher. With the help of some modern technology our daily life would not  so difficult. One point in my life is home banking. With the help of my home computer I can do all  thing, about money, with my bank. Some years ago I have to go to the bank. The new way is very easy and faster and I can spent my time with other things. An other point is the modern technology in my car. Because of the modern technology, the safety level in my car is very high. At the end I would say that everybody of us can not live without the modern technology, because the modern technology is necessary for us in all parts of our life. ",21.0
431," Mr. Manager: I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time. Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight I had waitted for fourthey five minutes. Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show. It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too. Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered. And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give  it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I couldn't get my money back.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat. She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good. She said that she wouldn't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute ever second. But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad. I just knew I couldn't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for  meal I was in a schock thinking why isn't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat  for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry. I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and  can't keep any secrets. ",22.0
624," Hello! My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition. Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office for experience. I hope, that's possible. I would prefer living in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is more natural. A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday. It sounds like a summer-holiday at the beach of Italy. From the activities  I want to take Golf and Surfing. Both activities I've never done in my life, so I am a complete beginner in playing Golf and in Surfing. But the reason I want to try these two activities are their image. Golf play the wealthy people, the upper class of a town, and surfing sounds like freedom. There is only one more question I want to ask: Can I take my girl-friend with me, of course with paying? I hope all my wishes are realizeable. Yours  [SEP]  In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre, that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours to pay only  a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think, you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something. I like going shopping during the week, when I can look at each good a store sells. But for me it is better, when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think, before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing! ",31.0
66," Dear Miss Clark, I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of events. Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it was written  in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented, I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside. Plays and Films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year. One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket. As a student, the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists. Finally, I would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a camping so that people who come from a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation. Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money, Money, Money Young people always need money, specially students who don't earn their life. They need money to pay  their studies or for going out, but how to find a job which is good and not under-paid? One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work. Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night. Unfortunately it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning. If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons which is one of the most prolific job but do it only if you like teaching. Otherwise you should try to find another job. The main thing to remember is that there  many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: ""I want to work and earn money"".

982," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter of 13 June. I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. I would like to travel only in July, because I have only one month holliday this year. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I think  is a great fun and a bit more adventurous. It is not too much confortable, but it is not a problem for me, I like this kind of holliday. I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity, I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I also will take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good occasion. I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with  and how many money, more or less, do you think I should take. Thank you  to ask me  my taste and to be preoccupated about it. I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Audrey Gillett  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Like you know last month, I had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot. Firstly I had to make the decor of the scene, so I made in the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put  some blue lights. furthermore I made some stars in paper in argent color. But that was only the begining of my adventure. The most exiting part was when I had to make up the pop stars ! I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed, but I was too happy to show my shyness. Do you believe that I spoke with Micheal Jackson, my favourite singer? I can't believe it yet! It was a wonderful experience. I will remember that day for the rest of my life. It was like a dream who becomes tru. I wish you had been there with me. I can't explain how supper it was. I stayed with him until the concert begun and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers. Well, I have to leave you now, but I will tell you more details when we next meet each other. See you soon. Love, Audrey ",31.0
222," Dear Sir or Madam, I have seen the advertisement for the musical show and I realised that there were some mistakes. First of all, it is written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook. The show should have started t 19.30. However it started at 20.15. We  kept waiting for 45 minutes. The tickets were sold for £10, £15 and £20. We were told that the discounts were available but they were not. We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed because of the cleaning. We had expected a brilliant show but we were very disappointed. I think the people who came there should be paid back. Faithfully,  [SEP]  If we compare a person who lived a very long time ago with another one who lives now, we will see a very big difference between their clothes. People used to wear very diffrent things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that they are 'clothes'. We would probably think that these things they wore were just to cover and protect themselves. Nowadays the aim in clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves. People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes. The things that people wear are changing every time, everyone tries to be diffrent in the public and very different sorts of clothes are being created. The things we wear may not seem as if 'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now. I belive they will wear very diffrent things. ",20.0
513," Dear Sir: How are you? I have been  the musical show ""over the rainbow"" in your theatre last week. I have got a few things to complain about  your theart. The first thing is in your note  says that you should have got Danny Brook in the show. But in the show, there was a another actor. I was so disappointing, because I came  far away to see Danny Broke. In the note  also says that the show start at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25. The show was started at 20:15, which means it has wasted one hour of my time. Note says that tickets has discounts available, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for  thicket. When the show is finished. I deciced to go and visit your theatre restaurant, But I went there and it is closed for some reasons. I was really hungry and I went to other restaurant as soon as I can. The note says that your perfect evening out, I thought I could get my money back, with your poor service and all my reasons, But it was not ask for money back. I was really disappointed about your threat and service, I hope I can get my money back and you can improve it. Than you for reading .   [SEP]  Today, science and technology help us a lot. For example. In the pass, people have to go and get wood, make a fire and cook, but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work. Science and technology can give us a better live style or better food. For example, before people have to walk from a place to the other, but now we can use sciene and technology to produce a lot of petrel transport and we can transport with them faster. We also can produce more and better food or using science and technology. e.g.  use science to put all the good part of two plants into one plant. We can also use techlogy to produce more food and help them grow faster. Science and technology can also used for some material e.g. steel or iron, which use for our building, it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy. Science and technology can give us a lot of good thing for our daily life, make us easy to do thing or work. ",20.0
1," 16.12.00 Dear Jane Firstly I want to tell you that the idea of the ""International Arts Festival"" was a really great idea. I enjoyed the festival pretty much. However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange little details. I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival. This also would take more attraction to the festival. Another point which I think was ennoying, are the concert halls. The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so much people I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall. The plays and the films were really great. I enjoyed all of them. I hope to see much more films next year. The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it made a really big effect on the attraction,  that of course made the festival much more enjoyable. I again want to say that it was really nice to be at the festival. I believe that next year will be better if you consider my ideas. Your Sinccerly  [SEP]  16.12.00 Dear Andrew, I just received your letter and decided you to write back now; because of your questions which were about the rules. I'm really tired of the rules in school! Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that I'm going  is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearing has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example if you don't come to school  10 days in a year we fail that year. Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to. This is all that I can tell you about my school and family. Rules are every where and you can't change them. So just don't think about them. Your Best Pen friend ",32.00

In answer to your questions, I will have to say that I just can go to the campament on July because of my job, they only gave me that month free. In the camp I would like to stay in  log cabins because I hate to sleep uncomfortable and, I will if I stay in a tent. Acording to your letter, you asked me to choose two of your activities. I  prefere to do some climbing because that's what I do in my spare time and I do it quite well. Apart from that, if you give surfing classes I would love to take them; surfing is one of my chilhood drems that I never came true. I have a few questions that you might be able to answer me. I don't know what tipe of clothes do I have to take and the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you please could help me  giving me this information I would be very pleased. Im looking forward to go to the camp and hearing from you soon Yours sincerely Carmen Garcia.  [SEP]  Shooping is not always enjoyable. We all have been shooping once in our lifes and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we had a class discussion and we all agree in some points. For example if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were looking for, and instead of buing what we came for we will go out with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be  waste of time. Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then is where the problems begin. Most of the times one get lost, or they start plaing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get on a bad mood and you'll have a bad shooping day. So if you want to have a good relaxing shooping day, we recommend you not to go with your little brothers and to go with enogh time to look arround for what you really want. ",26.0

DURING MY STAY AT THE CAMP I'M REALLY FOND OF KEEPING  MY TENNIS AND SWIMMING ROUTINES. I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MANTEIN A COLUMN TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAVE RECOMMENDED ME TO DO. ALSO, IF I HAVE ANY LEISURE TIME BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PIANO LESSONS, I PRACTISE TENNIS. SO, AND IF IT POSSIBLE, I WAS INTERESTED ON THE POSSIBILITY OF COVER MY ROUTIN THERE.

439," Dear Sir, Last week, I had visited your theatre and I was very disappointed because I did not have a perfect evening out like what  advertisement said. I would like to complain  four things about your theatre. Fist thing, the actor is very horrible so I recommend you to change the actor because he will make an audience who visit you theatre disappoint. Second thing, you should open the show on time because if the audience have to wait, they will not feel happy but I think you know that. According to the advertisement, it said tickets £ 10, £ 15 and £ 20 discounts available but when I bought the ticket, the discounts did not available After the show I was very hungry so I went to the restaurant in the theatre but it was closed for decorating that make me very angry and disappoint. To conclude, your theatre is not good like what advertisement said so I would like to ask for some money back. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, (Chan Suntavee)  [SEP]  Nowadays, science and technology are very important to our life. The technology make my daily life change a lots compare to the past. For example, when I was young, I used to walk to school everyday but now my father has a car so I don't have to walk anymore, because my father gives me a lift everyday. At home, I have a video game so I play it all the time and I'm very enjoy that  make my daily life happy so it's excellent but on the other hand I didn't do any homework or study at all. Another example is  computer, I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can know the news by using  internet in the computer. To sum up, the modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways. Therefore my daily life will change to bad ways or goods ways, it depends on how I use the technology. ",21.0
380," Dear Sir/Madam I went to see 'over the rainbow' presented by the circle theater. I was really disappointed therefore I am writing a  complain. Firstly I bought the ticket because I like Danny Brook's acting but in the show someone was acting his part. Also the person was not really good at acting. Secondly the time on the leaflet is totaly wrong. It said it will start at 19:30. Infact it started t 20:15. I was waiting for 45 minuts. Thirdly the ticket was no discount and after the show I visited  theater restaurant but it was close because the show started too late. Finaly last nigh was not  perfect evening. (Therefore) I want to have  money back and I hope you will think about these problems. Your faithfully  [SEP]  I am writing an article about  fashion of the future to the international student magazine. Fashion are always changing therefore it is really difficult to say what sort of clothes people wear in  future. But when I heard the word of future, I have  image of metalic colour so that  my imagination they are wearing metalic or bright colour cloth. May be they have more different types of colour than now. However I think the style of fashion will not have big differences because I believe that fashion is in a circle. The mean of this is all our fashion styles come from history. For example our fashion style at the moment is comes from 70's fashion. We always repeat the fashion with adding some new fashion at that time.  I think the people will wear clothes which are metalic or bright colourful colour with mixture of history and future fashion style. in  future. ",25.0

I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and  swimming. When I was in  fourth form, I got the first prize in  swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price. Lastly, I would like to ask you  questions. First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money. It will be very kind of you, if you can answer my questions. Your sincerely, Seua Thanapol.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you. I am fine and I hope you're fine too. I have an interesting story to tell you. I've been asked to help by the well known band called Westlife. At first I was surprised but in a few secound later, when I relised that, I didn't allow to go, I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go. At last, she allowed me . I had to help them behind the state, while they were get dressed. I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly. Although the work was not heavey, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their signature and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the state and dance with them. I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience I have ever had. I was really enjoy at the concert. Thing that I particularly like in the concert is I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert which is another well known band. I really want to have that experience again. That is my story. Tell me yoors. I want to know what experience you've had when you were in England. Best wishes, ",28.0
376," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you about an incident I had with the musical show which was presented by your theatre during my week's holiday in London. First of all, I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the starring was not Danny Brook as your company had published. Moreover, the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15. As the show finished later, we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but to our surprise, it was closed. As a result, we came back home in order to eat some fast food. An other thing is that there was  any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show. Before this week ends, I want your company to give me the money back. Otherwise, I will sue your company. I hope this kind of behaviour does not happen again. Your faithfully, Manuela T. Miracola  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day, while I was studying maths, one of my friends, called Pat, asked me to have a coffe with her. We went to a place called 'Deli' where we talked a lot about our school, the exams and, as we usually did, about our friends and boy friends. We asked each other a lot of questions but then we started talking about things that had never been talked about with anybody. Such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our life and that kind of secrets... The problem started when I confesed  her that I had fall in love with Larry, who was my cousin's boyfriend. In spite of the fact that I told her to keep it as a secret, she went to my cousin's house and made the retelling of what I had exactly told her.  As a result, my cousin went to my house in order to gave her a detailed description of it. As I solved the trouble with my cousin, I understood why my mother had told me that 'friends' sometimes weren't as you expected them to be. ",28.0
13," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing this letter to give my opinion on the last International arts festival. Firstly I found amazing the number of starts and artist who came to the festival although they where from only six countries around the world. The concerts and the dance show were incredable, except for the classical concert that   halled to small. Secondly the plays and films were very good organized despide being  short number. I suggest  to do a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new life style and society, it was totaly different from ours. The talks by writers were very tecnic but it could be understood by all the people who were in the festival In conclusion, I am impresed on all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price has been excelent because there wasn't any limit of hours. I hope that you organice this festival for all the following years. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Alice, How are you? I'm pleased to hear from you. As you already know I go to an English school, Bear House, in Spain. The rules in my country are standart, I mean, the rules are very similar to other countries in Europe. At school you aren't allowed to bring  connected movil phones although there are more than one student that does it. Teachers will take it from you if it rangs during school hours. As well you aren't allowed to bring drugs or arms, to smoke or to drink alcohol inside the school. You have to respect other peoples opinion, teachers, school's material and people who works in the school. If you broke one of these rules you could be expulsed for a week, a month or for ever. At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful with my parent's time table. I can go out at night once a week if I tell them were I'm going to be. In case I lie  them or don't explain my plans that my friends and I have I want be able to go out. As well have the responsability  to look after my brother in case they aren't at home. Answering to you question I won't change nothing because I think that these are the minimum rules that a theenager have to have to be responsable in a future. love ",29.00
96," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre. I am writing regarding to our visit to the Circle Theatre  the 17th June. When we saw your advertisment for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediatly decided that this must be a perfect evening out. There was in our opinion two reasons for that, our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwords. However the evening become very disappointing. Firstly, Danny Brook was not acting, there was another unknown actor and he was not good. Secondly, the show was supposed to start  19.30, but did not start until 20.15. Thirdly, in your advertisment it says that discounts should be available, but it was not. Above these the restaurant was closed because of  water leakage. I am therefore asking for a compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a sollution as soon as possible. Yours sincerelly Adra Johansson  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take more than one day before everyone knew about my decision. I had thought about it for many years but never been able to fulfill my dreams. This year I had the opportunity to make my dreams come through. However I wasn't sure if my decision was right and therefore I decided to discuss it with Pat. Pat is my best friend, since we first met in primary school. It is now twenty years ago. I really like Pat, she's funny, has a good sence of humor and like me she loves to discuss everything. So therefore, my choise to ask her about my decision was the best  I could do. She really listen to me and told me that I did the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application for an language course in England. I wanted to keep this as a secret until I received the answer from the School. But it is ok, I still like Pat, even though she can't keep a secret. ",27.0
178," Dear Madam/Sir, I'm writting to you to explain my problem that I have had in your theatre. I recentely had a week's holiday in London, and during my stay, I went in your theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"" because I have seen an advertisement about this show and I was really interrested  to see it for many reasons, one of this reasons it is that I love the starring Danny Brook. And I would like that you know that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook. Secondly, in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reallity the show has started at 20:15 and the discount was not available. Finally, I wanted to visit you theatre restaurant after the show but it was already closed. So, I had a very disappointing evening and it would be very kind of you if you give me back the money . I'am looking forward to hear  you as soon as possible. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  I think it is very good to have a science and technology because it can really affects our lives. For example 20 years ago, people who were affected by the AIDS Virus couldn't live more than two or three years, but now with the new science, there is several therapi and now people affected by this virus can live many years. I think you can do a lot  of think now than before with the techonology. You can travel around the world by train, by plane or by ship and maybe one day you can fly by car. Why not. I hope that you will find this composition interesting. best reguard. ",22.0

You have informed the actor, times, discount and the restaurant to people, but actually what did you do? The first, you have changed the actor. The second, the time is late from 19.30, it started 20.15. The third, the tickets have not the discount. The last, after  show, I couldn't go to the restaurant, because it was closed. What's happened? This is the good theatre do, or not? This is the famous theatre. You know, What did people feel? Everybody attented go to the show, funny, and happ in the end, and what have we go then? Disapponted! Thank about that. If you can not managed the programe, why did you informe people before  programe start? I tought you inderstood'; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me? Thank you,  [SEP]  Now we know, our world have developed to new world, becase we have high technology to do. If we came back to the past, we felt everything, it was so difficult to do, we would have plane and done by ourself and last time. In the present, the teachnology is a past of life. It started from got up in the morning, we have the machine help us to cook, iron, cleanning, washing, and then we went out to work, there are car, sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly.

1130," Dear Mr Robertson, At first, thank you for your programme. It is very various and interesting. We all enjoy it. But last week we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. This presentation will show the latest fashions and the leisure and sports wear. We would be very interesting in seeing the english fashion. At this show we could see different new  make up and hairstyles. The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students. For pratical informations, this show start at 10.00 and close at 19.00. It will stay in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It is not too far and the openning hours fit us. About the programme, we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping. As far as we are concerned we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery. We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and  the afternoon, if some one of us is intersted, we could see the National Art Gallery. I hope you won't be too angry for this changing but we would all like to go to the show. Waiting for your answer, receive our greetings. For the class  [SEP]  General speaking, homes will change considerably. They will become less dark and more confortable than today.  People's homes will build more economically by using natural energies like solar or wind energy. This improvments will be involved by the lack of petrol and unrecycling energies. About the size of hous, I think that in cities houses will be more and more little because of the over population. We also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats. In opposite, in the suburb or in the land, more and more rich people will build big houses. Homes like this will be build with the latest technologies and  very luxurious. But about  differences between  rich's and poor's homes  will be the same in the futur. New technologies and facilities won't improve the relationship between people. I think that people will be as alone and julous as today. ",23.00
1024," Dear Mr Robertson, On behalf of my class, I am writing to request  few changes in our London programme which has already been planned. My friends have seen an advertisement which is  the London fashion and leissure show. it will be held on 14th March. We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions, make up,  hairstyles instead of going to do shopping. We would suggest gong to this fabolous show. it is also free of charge for students. We will be given a great opportunity to have fun and look around in London. We would all thank you for the organised programme. I apologise  any inconvenience that this cause you. We would be pleased if you could make a new arrangement in your programme I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincererly,  [SEP]  CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW YOUR HOUSE? We spend most of our life in our houses. We like them show our life style and of course feel ourself comfortable. I can imagine in the future how it would be? It would be much  technological or far less complex. it could be as simple as we think. but the imagine of the life style depends on  person. On the other hand, it would not be changed. Somehow I could say that the main appliance would remain the same working structure. it only just might be changed the design of things such as a triangular talking oven. Despite being used in many ways, it could entartian us as well. On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier. to live. I wouldn't mind having things talking to around me. it would be enjoyable to have virtual friends in my house. Although I imagine   my house in my future, I am sure I would be suprised when I had them. ",19.00
279," Dear Sirs, Two weeks ago, I came to London for a week's holiday. During my stay in your city, I had the opportunity to assist to your show named 'Over the rainbow' after having read an advertisement in the magazine 'Going-out' of the 1st of June . I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay  full price. Then, even if we could enter in the room, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expects. Indeed, we are still waiting on Danny Brook who was not in the piece. And last, at the end of the program, we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance. As this evening was for my family and I a wasted one, I permit myself to ask you for  refund. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully JANN BRUL  [SEP]  There is no need to be a genious to notice that technology has evoluated so considerably during the last  decades that our everyday life has changed. From my point of view, modern technology has first permit to me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer. In this domain, you have to afford everyday the development of new technology. And as new discoveries bring new discoveries, progress is going faster and faster. The advantage of this is that you need to   interest yourself in all if you don't want to be put on the side. And so, your life is not boring at all as you learn new things everyday. In the other hand, you cannot stay quiet for 2 week as some new inventions come out every day. Finally, new technology have a great influence on my life as it permits me to live on. But, who knows, may be one day I will develop  technology that will send me right to the unemployment office!

192," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about a musical show presented in your theatre. Indeed, I recently spent a week's holiday in London and I went to the theatre to see ""Over the Rainbow"". It was really a very disappointing evening. I was disappointed to see that Danny Brook, announced on your advertisement, did not act in this show. Indeed, he was replaced by a different actor for this evening. Additionally, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, and I had to pay the full price for my ticket as no discount was available. However, the worst was to come as it was impossible to eat something after the show. Indeed, the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was ill. I hope you can imagine my great disappointment. Therefore, I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Science and technology have played an important role for the last twenty years and the development of the modern technology has especially affected our lives. To take my personal example, I would be no more able to live without some of the most recent discoveries, which make my daily life easier. For instance, I can't imagine living without using a computer to write my scholar works, to play a game or to order some goods on the Internet. This latter is a new media which has changed my life, as it is a marvellous tool  to communicate, learn or have fun. Another important change related to the modern technology are the credit cards. Until I have had one, I was often run out of cash and had to go to the bank. At the present time, thanks to my credit card, I can really buy what I want, when I want and where I want! To sum up, there are many other discoveries in relation with the modern technology which affect my daily life. However it would be too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you also know them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life. ",29.0
414," Dear manager of the circle theatre, Two months ago I went to see your musical show. I got very angry because you are liars. It was one of the most disappointing evening of my life. The advertisement said that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor  was different. Who can believe it? You are really a funny theatre. And  the time too. You wrote that at 19.30 the musical started. I was waiting for 45 minute. the show started at 20:15. I paid 20 pounds without any discount. You said that some discouns was available. Nobody took a discount. When I went to the reastaure I was really suprised. It was closed and I steel don't know why? In the advertisemen you wrote ""your perfect evening out"", that's very funny. It was Just a disappointing night and I want you to return to me some of my money, a very angry man  [SEP]  The modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways. The modern technology help me when I do my homework,  to  some games e.t.c. First of all the computer. It helps me when I studie. I can find many things from the internet or to write my compositions on it. The car has changed my daily life, like everyone else. I can go from one place to  other very fast Most of the machines which you have at home help me, too. I can find cold water in the refrigarator but 50 years before the didn't have the refrigarator, so our life is easier, today. When I stay home I can watch  or listen to the radio e.t.c. so the modern technology help me to spend my free time. As you have seen the modern technology has changed my daily life a lot and I believe that it has changed it to the better. ",25.0
264," Dear Sir/MADAME, I am writting  you because yesterday I went to the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" and I had a bad evening. First of all, in the advertisement  says that the starring were different actors, and there weren't different one, so that can not be. Also in the advertisement  says, that the show will begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that mean that I have to cancelled a date that I had at 21:00, because I coudn't make it. If you present a show you must be on time. Another thing that happened was that the tickets did not have discount and the advertisement says the will have. So, how is  possible that you present an advertisement and you don't make what it say? Finally, it supose to have the restaurant open, and it wasn't, because they didn't have electricity to cook, so they close it. I am really made and I want my money back, please call me to the number 23456789, I will be waiting  your call. Thank  for your time your sincerelly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Modern technology have change my daily life in many aspects. First of all at work; computer are really amazing, you only need to turn it on and start to write; your work is more clean and you work faster. Also change my free time, they had invented great games like play station, and you can have a really good time with your friend playing. In the early day, on a raining day you couldn't play because most of game were  outside the house but now with the technology you can make many things in your house. Another aspect is , on the house artefacts, microwaves, laundrymachine, make life easily. In my opinion technology have made human life easily, funier and more comfortable. ",22.0
259," Dear sir, I'm writing  you to complain about the disappointing expirience I had with your theatre. First of all, I arrived at about 19:20 because  advertisement said that performance begins at 19:30, but it wasn't till about 20:15 that the begin of the show and I had to wait  entire hour which was not very amazing. Secondly, I was supposed to have a discount but there were no discounts, although the advertisement said there are. Thirdly, the disappointment made me a bit hungry but the restaurant was closed without any sign saying why. And at last, the most disappointing point, the advertisement again said that there would be Danny Brook, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him. So, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that  advertisement promissed. As things went that way, I want my money back. Sincerely Yours,  [SEP]  I shall have a look into the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen. How much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make even  cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use  different kind of cooling  and will tell you if your forgot to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to  devices modern technology offers us. ",33.0
564," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I am very happy to be the winner of the competition and I am looking forward to come to Camp California. I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have. From August, in fact, I will start with a new job and I will not be able to live Rome for a long period. As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because tents are too hot for me. I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do so. So, I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them. Please let me know how is the climate like at the Camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes. It would be also useful for me to know if there will be some extra expenses, in order to take enough money for two weeks. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vittoria Santini  [SEP]  Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops, try on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally go back home with dozens of bags in your hands. However, there are a few moments in which you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because  shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other month's. Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress  and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes. Anyway, apart from these two cases, shopping is always very amusing. ",35.0

About accomodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer of nature. I choose climbing and sailing for the activities. Although I have never climb (so I am a complete beginner). I am very interested in learning Climbing. But I sailed a long time ago so I am quite a beginner  too. Finally I would like to know what sort of clothes I should bring and also if I should bring some money. You can contact me for further information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Astrid de Martel Perrault  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, I was happy to receive your letter and, as you asked me, I will tell you how my experience was and how great it was. The most exciting thing when you help at a pop concert is that you can meet popstars, and, indeed, I met OUR favourite popstar! I talked to him and we ate a sandwich together talking about his album. I will never forget this moment. But don't worry, I thought about you and he signed an autograph for you, you will find it with this letter. On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the room and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are! But I could stand up on the scene and talk with the musicians. When I receive the photos I took, I will write  you again to give them to you. Looking forward to hearing from you Love, Astrid ",35.0

Before everything, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English in a college. Such being the case, I need to wait until my college's lessons finishes. If it's possible for you I would prefer to come in July. Before this time, I usually stay in log cabins, But I never had  chance for staying in a tent.

On the other hand, I've just learnt from your letter that I can have some sport activities during the camp. I'm very happy about this. Because, I spent most of my scholl life  for sports, specially for basketball. But, after staring to work, I hadn't any chance for playing basketball. Now, you gave  a opportunity. As a my second activities, I would like to choose photography, because my education was including photography, I love to take some photographs about nature. Meanwhile, I'd like to ask some questions to you. When I'm coming, what king of clothes could  be able to wear in there? And also, what do you think how much money, I'll need to spend for two weeks.

98," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing  you to complain about ,,Over the Rainbow"" musical show which took a place in The Circle Theatre several weeks ago. First of all,  advertisement for the shows provided absolutely WRONG information about  actors. Danny BROOK, who should play according  your advertisement was replaced by an another actor and it disappointed me. The show should start at 19.30, however, the audience have been waiting for fourty five minutes. Also, in the advertisement you have mentioned discounts which were not provided. The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I had not recieved the explanations why. On the whole, the evening was boring and disappointing. Based on everything listed above, I would like to recieve  £10, which I have paid, back. The ticket for the show is included. Look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has morden technology changed my life. New technologies have become the part of our lives. There are a lot of arguments about the weather this influence is negative or positive. Nevertheless, it has affected every person and hopefully in a good way. Personally, I consider modern technologies as a positive innovation. Using  microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time. Computer is extrrmely convenient in writing reports and essays. And, of course, I can not forget about cars and planes that deliver us to all parts of the Earth. However, many people, insist that new technologies affect people in a negative way. I would better prefer seeing my father talking to his family instead of staring at blue screen of TV. But also, I would not be able to imagine my life without the nice way of reciving news with help of it. Counting  pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points in working out and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway. Modern girl or boy already would not be able to imagine life without them. ",27.0
433," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because I went to The Circle Theatre some days ago and I regret to inform you that it was not a good experience. According to the advertisement Danny Brook was the male actor. However he did not act, and his sustitute was not very good at acting. Secondly I had problems with both tickets and time. The play started at 20:15 instead of 19.30. Furthermore I could not get a discount although I think I was entitled to it. (I have a special youth card). In addition the theatre restaurant was not available because of the waiters' strike. In conclusion, not only my evening was horrible but also expensive. That is why I ask you for refunding my money, or at least part of it. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie (Accident) Dear Nigel, I was pleased to hear from you last week.

Firstly the main character is Evans, a retired police captain. He is not as well-known as Poirot or Miss Marple, but his personality it quite interesting. I am sure you'll agree with me. Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it catchs your attention since the first moment. Finally, you should pay attention to the ending which is surprising. I hope you will spend a good evening listening to the radio.

I would like to go to Camp California in the USA only in July as it is my summer holidays . It will be convenient for me then because I have two months holiday. I would like to do Tennis and Photography. I am in the team for tennis at school and I have played against different other schools before. I also enjoy photography. I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E. so it would be very helpful for me to practise. About the accommodation at the Camp, I would like to stay in tents because I love to be outside and I like dangerous adventures. I can also then wake up in the morning and take photographs of the wonderful sceneries. I would like to ask you about what kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I have bring. Will there be any shops? Please could you send me an itenerary of the trip? Thank you very much. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends which normally is the only appropreaite time! Not only shops are crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queue. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side of 'shopping'. I, personally enjoy shopping very much. I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them. I find that shopping is a very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath. I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future, there will be no more crowded streets because of the 'internet'  which you can order onlines.

Later I found out that the stars and artists had only come from six countries. Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were clasics as well.  The only thing that distracted me was the size of the concert halls.   They were very small and I was pushed by everyone. There were wonderful plays and films which I hope that there would have been more .  All the other shows such as dance shows, art exhibition and talks by writers were very amusing. I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably-priced for all events.  I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days in the Arts Festival at the end. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Once upon a time there was a widow and a widower.  They treated each other as if they were husband and wife. Around two years later there was a meeting.  By that time the widow could not walk and the widower could not see.  When the widower sensed that the widow badly wanted to go, the widow clung on the widower's back and set off telling him where to go. On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.  The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.  They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.  He came and said to the widower that he was to bring him on his back.  The widow who was afaid told the man of the gold. When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.  He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake into half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle. The man went back to the widower and kicked him.  The widower was confused and they went to the lake.  They were very surprised when they found out the gold was cut in half.  They lived happily ever after.   This story happened a long time ago. ",32.00
878," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you required some additional information. I am very happy to have won a two-week trip at Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work. Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip. As I am an expert camper, I would prefer to be accommodated in  tents  than in  log cabins. What concerns activities at the camp, I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis. The former because I am an excellent basketball-player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport as I am a complete beginner at it. I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions. I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would be suitable to bring with . I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  REPORT ON DAILY LIFE AT MY SCHOOL, FOR MY ENGLISH TEACHER Introduction After our English class' decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed. The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them. Here are my findings. Best lessons to film As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest to film Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educative and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard. Interesting activities One event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent. Conclusion In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video. Because the above mentioned events are the most praised or criticised ones by all students. INDIAN DEMURO ",38.0
498," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to you to complain about your Circle theatre. First of all I must say that ""over the rainbow"" is not the London newest and best musical show, for many reasons: In your advertisement I read the times , it was 14.30 and 10.30, however it started  20.15! So I've been doing the nothing for a long time and I don't like to lose my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove?, where were they the last weekend? the last weekend in the theatre  was a different actor who was disappointing. To make the evening worse the tickets were not discounts available, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over. I want the money back, if you don't give it to me back, I will intend to write to the press and explain everything, and of course I won't be the only one. I am so furious because when I asked for  money back that day, the sir wasn't able to give it back because he would be sack. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  the secret lover Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually makes up some extra information. On day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes (as Pat likes women). The only problem was that the girl was to shy to speak to him, she wanted to keep her name in secret, and if Pat tells someone something about the letter, she won't say who  is. Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time, even eating his nails. As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it. Three days after we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, ""oh Pat don't tell  that lie again"", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter. We laughed and explained  him that we were   who wrote that letters, and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover, a real one,  don't tell anyone because  he won't meet her. ",22.0
865," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply for your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer season, and it is nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer my accomodation to be in  log cabins, because I am alergic to some insects that might go in the tent. In regard to the activities, I would like tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have  some techniques, that I would like to put on practise. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where can I change my money to American dollars cheaper. I would  ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope you are doing fine, I am writing this letter, to tell you about my experience of helping  a pop concert. Firstly, you need to know, and be counscious of what you are doing. I spend two weeks preparing all the stage, speakers, background, michrophones, everything with all the staff, and every night, the artists came to rehearsal their show, I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff. The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired, however, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts were worthy, the crow and artists thanked the staff. What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all like a big team, working together. That was what made it mostly special. Try it, I recommend it. Write back soon, Love, Carmen Dolores Rossell. ",36.0
587," Dear Helen Thank you for my prize! I  never been in the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California. I can only have some holidays in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time, that is why I would like to travel during those two weeks. For the accommodation I would prefer to have  tents because I used to travel in Campsites and I love it during summer, just to change the customs!! Concerning those activities I have choosen two of them. I enjoy swimming and anytime I have  opportunities to swim I go. My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that  is better to join one sport and one ""soft leisure"" and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I don't know for my holidays. Please could you tell me about the weather if I need special clothes and about the money for the change if you don't mind. See you soon! Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" ""Shopping today!""  You decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a ""shopping destination"", that is mean that you need something special for you or someone else. You have the money and the time as you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion  on yourself! and after that you can make a stop in the Duty-free  and buy some chipper souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with  money to buy that you always wanted to. But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend ask you to come for shopping, it should be boring! and you  become jealous against him and want him to do that quickly! or you  are going to get nervous! And you can find  too much people in  shops, it is too hot or you can not have your right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! or you decide to not spend  money in shopping today, but in front of the shop. What is going on?? So, you'd better to stay  home today... ",21.0
924," Dear Mrs Ryan, I AM REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PRIZE I'VE WON, I'M WRITING TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED ME FOR AND, IF IT'S POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SOME FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE CAMP. I WOULD PREFER TRAVELLING IN JULY, BECAUSE I HAVE MY EXAMS IN JUNE AND I'VE SIGNED FOR A CONTRACT  AS A SHOP ASSISTANT STARTING IN AUGUST. SINCE I HAVE THE CHOICE FOR MY ACCOMODATION, I'LL DEFINETELLY GO FOR THE LOG CABINS, BECAUSE I CAN'T BARE THE HEAT INSIDE THE TENT. OUT OF THE LIST OF ACTIVITIES GIVEN I'VE CHOSEN GOLF AND PHOTOGRAPHY; GOLF BECAUSE I LOVE THE SPORT ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET TO PLAY IT MUCH (I'M NOT BAD AT IT), AND PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TO LEARN BUT I'VE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IS ABOUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS, SO I CAN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO TAKE, AND ABOUT COSTS, SO I CAN MAKE A BUDJET FOR THE HOLIDAY. YOURS SINCERELY Angelo Costa  [SEP]  DEAR KIM, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU WROTE TO ME TO ASK HOW EVERYTHING HAD GONE AT THE CONCERT; SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW THINGS WENT. MY JOB MAINLY INVOLVED HELPING TO SET THE STAGE AND TO TAKE IT DOWN AFTER THE CONCERT, BUT I ALSO GAVE A HAND BACKSTAGE WHEN NEEDED. I WAS PART OF THE STAFF, WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS CARD AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, SPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED UNDER THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M. WITH AN HOUR BRAKE FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS THE SAME AFTER THE CONCERT. AFTER THE STAGE WAS SET, THE REST OF THE THINGS I HAD TO DO WERE QUITE EASY AND ENJOYABLE; I COULD STAY EITHER BACK OR FRONT STAGE AND GIVE A HAND IF NEEDED, I REALLY ENJOYED IT BECAUSE I LEARNT A LOT OF TECNICAL THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW; AND WHAT I ALSO ENJOYED WAS THE GOOD PAY! Lots of love Angelo. ",35.0
183," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to tell  that I saw your musical show ,,Over the rainbow"" and there were too many disappointing divergences between the advertisement for the show and the show itself. The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show. However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement. Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although, it had to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening,  I think you should know that ticket were sold without any discounts. It seems to me that all these failures were your falt, because you were responsible for the arrangement of the show. I think you ought to have postponed the show and have reimbursed me  a ticket price. However, conserning that I saw the show, I would like to get a half refund. Please reply at your earliest convinience. I look forward to receiving your reply. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology changed my daily life completely. When I saw modern technology I mean  Internet. For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend after some hours since he has written it. My friend lives in Kresnodar. My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar. And it takes 3 days to her letter to get to Kursk. That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses  post service. So with  Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time. Another change in my life is that I use  Internet as a library when I write my course papers. So that I can get books which  is impossible to get in  libraries of my town. That is why I think that modern techology helps me in my daily life. ",30.0
888," Thank you for that information. I don't expected that I can win in your's competition. I like to travel only  July becouse now I'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I don't have a time for enything else. When I will arrive. I would prefer accommodation in Log cabins. I prefer that becouse I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation. I tell you in sicryt that, I don't know whay she do that. You said that I will have the chance to do two activities, sou I choose swimming and sailing. I Love all kind of water sports. In summer I always goes to  seaside or some kind of lake to swim. I like to catch fisch too. I think that I'm good at swimming. When I was young I had been swimm in many competition. My live record is 27.66 for fivety meters. I would like to ask you about  weather at California's  Julay. What kind of clothes I should bring with me. Are there any discoteks or something I would like to know if my wife can come with me, becouse withou't she I can't be there.  [SEP]  Daily life at my school I'm studying at National Academy of Defense. There is about two thousands students at my school. There are only men. Everybody gets up at six, and  first things they do it is run for about two thousends five houndred meters. Then they take a schower and everybody goes for breakfast. Usually I have eight lessons. Two times a week I have W-F. This is very important, becouse every soldier schould be strong. Today there was the sport competition in Basketball. My group of students won that competition for  second time. I'm not playing basketball well, but my friends do. After this competition there was a mathematic, and two houers of biology. I don't like biology, sow I sleept on the desk in a class-room. I think that competitions should be filmed becouse my school is a kind of sport's school. On video there schould be howe we get's up. Houe we run, houe we eat breakfast. Then you should schow houe ouer school looks from outside. There schould be an intereview witch students and with profesons. Daily life at my school that is not only school and teachers and mathematicas problems. There is a military problems too. We spends a lot of time outside the school during the military things. We must knou haue to use a gun, or have to drive a tank. That kind of thinks should be filmed somehow. ",21.0
148,"  Mr. Jones, How are you? I'm not so well, and that's the reason why I'm writting this letter to you. Because you are the manager at the theatre, you have to know,  the problems which it has. First of all and the most important for me is that you lie to your audience. I didn't see anywhere Danny Brook, but another actor. That it was a big mistake. Unfortunatly your advertisment  said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later. Also there weren't any discounts. Oh! I as almost forget. You restaurant was closed because your cooker was ill. What can you say about that? So, that's why I'm asking you to give me, some of  money back. The perfect evening out I was waiting for, it was finally one of the most disappointed, of mine. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? That's a good question! I know that, each student gave its  different answers, but some of us will have some opinions. I think that, the big 'improve' of technology  the last 30 years helped and  still helping us a lot in our daily life. With T.V we can learn, what is going on all over the world. With the telephones, the aeroplanes,  even the fast ships there are no big distances any more. Eve summer I'm going with my family abroad. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer (  internet) I can speak with my friends, as far they are. All these may be sounds great, but they aren't all . With a lot of using of  T.V and computer, make people more close. You might not know your neighbour because all the time your  in the house. Children are not studying as much  they have to, because they are watching T.V, speacing on the phone or even playing computer games. That's why my marks this year were  bit low. And ofcourse my parents were very angry with me. This is also another reason of heard attacts. ",22.0
642," Dear Ms Ryan, I am writing to you to give  some requiered information. First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition. I am happy to visit the United States under your organisation. Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in  log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge  to stay in  tents for 2 weeks. Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join . Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. As you can see, I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not  beginners anymore. Moreover, could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should take with me? What kind of money is used? I am looking forward to going on holidays. Yours sincerely, Mr Oliver Herre  [SEP]  Brighton, 13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Excuse me that I didn't write you sooner. As you know, I was fairly busy with my studying for my First Certificate. The concert was absolute marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job. Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact  and access to all the famous Pop Stars. I had to bring them refreshments. That has been my dream since my childhood. I was a little bit disappointed about their attitude. They didn't really appreciate my service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience. Whatever, if you ever will have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked to see their way of life. I hope you will write  me very soon and I hope you know more about my concert experience in the backstage area. Lots of love, ",31.0
28," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about an annual international arts festival with a good impression. I have spent two days on it which was exciting. However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it. The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is  great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from six countries apart from your advertisement. I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events. The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic , which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for  audience, so a few people had to stand and watch  concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised. As well as that, I expect you plays and films are performed more. Even if the majority of my friends had a good time there I saw some people would anticipate it, because there were many people who were impressed in it. Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is a excellent price because when I am tempt to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand   other friends. That's how I am feeling about that. I expect you can be organised even better next year. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Thank you for your letter. I could be interested in your letter. But it is quite different rather than you. Becoming more strict gradually at home that at school is true as you said. Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test. But most teachers consult with their parents, so it they behave wrongly it is true  teachers call their parents. Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on  weekend they have to help parents to do some chores. But people would like to change  life style in their house because there haven't been convenient appliaces in their house yet. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours ",23.00
17," Dear Miss , I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better. First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some  concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for  the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing  dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event. That is everything I have noticed about the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Sharyl, Thank you for your letter. I really enjoyed reading it. I'm very happy to know you're pretty well. Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning! In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up. I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you! Take care. I'll write to you soon! Love, ",31.00

If you are interested by more moderns buildings I can suggest you to visit ""Caldea"" which is a very modern bath centre with a beautiful architecture.

265," Dear Sir, During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called ""Over the rainbow"" at The Circle Theatre. I saw an advertising which  seemed very atractive to me. I have to say, it was not the best musical show. I think it was pretty bad. I had a very disappointing evening for many reasons. Firstable, I decided to come see your show to be pleased by the act of Danny Brook as I was so sad to find an other actor on the stage. Another thing was the hours. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's enbelievable  to be late with 45 minutes. When I got to the tickets desk before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available  as I read on the advertising. After the show, I went to the restaurant to have a drink after all of these disappointments, but the doors were close because of renovations. I think you will understand  it was not ""my perfect evening out"" as you said, but one of the worth. For all these reasons I am asking you to give  my money back. Best Regards,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she put me in such trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed together in a host family in the surburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met  very interesting so everything was perfect. We had mostly a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I had only 19 years old  as everyone know that the majority for beeing able to go out in the USA is 21 years old. If you don't have   the majority your aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or even worth to go in a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and me decided to go out in a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in it. At the entrance, the security guard asked for  identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I've forgot it  home. The man said it was OK for this time and we get in quite easely, we've made it. It was such a fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to be thirsty. We went at the bar and ask for  drink with alcohol. Of course by the time we get in it we forgot all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking any time 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening, ending with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping so well a secret!! ",25.0

Appart from that, here you are the repplies that you asked me for: - concerning to the date: I can go in July because it's my holidays month. That was  my boss told me. - About the accomodation, as I read, you can offer me  log cabins or  tents. From my point of view, I think tents are better than log cabins, so please, could you accomodate me in a tent? - Activities: I am very keen on surfing because, where I live, I can pactice it every day. I also want to ""book in"" singing because I love singing very much and I am always singing in my house. Thank you so much for your attention. Yours faithfully Javi Fernández  [SEP]  Why don't you buy the green one? Oh, no! That's horrible, mum! This is one of a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are buying and getting clothes from the shelves. That is what most of the women love. They love going to a shopping centre and put lots of clothes on. That's so good when you have  money for joy it but, appart from that, there are many problems. On the one hand, a big problem are the children. When they go to shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that their sight reach: doors, little cars, films... but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, there are the children: crying because they are tired for shopping all the day. On the other hand there is a big problem: the mony. People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they arrives in their houses, they can see an empty wallet. So, do you believe that a shopping bag like this one is an enjoyable shopping day? ",24.0
1100," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for the programme you have organised for our visit to London. We think it will be a very interesting trip, especially the sightseeing by bus. In our class, we have read an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 March from 10:00 to 19:00. As we are going to be in London on this date, we think, it could be a great oppurtunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students. Because of this reasons, we would kindy ask you to change the programme, so that we could go to this especial event. We suggest visiting the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday 15 March and canceling the Shopping on Tuesday 14 March. Hoping on your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  An especiall invitation It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having  holidays with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited from  locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity  visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared. In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't had this possibility and the family where we were staying with, kindly boiled the water for us. We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was find, but on the second week I got very seek. I think it was the water. My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one. Some days later we went back to Dehli and having being to the doctor and having again  bottled water, I was feeling healthy again. ",34.00
397," Dear Sir Last week I attempted the musical ""Over the rainbow"", and I am writting in order to complaint about things that really disappointed me. First of all, I want to say that in the play  appeared a different actor  despite  that in the advertisement appeared the name of Danny Brook, that actor was very bad. Another thing I want to add is that the musical started 45 minutes late, it was planned to start at 19.30 and it really did it at 20:15. During this time we had to keep seating in the theatre and it was boring and tiring. Thirdly, when I bought the tickets, I asked for discounts and nobody know anything about them, so it is false  there are discounts available. However, we enjoyed the musical, but while going out to have dinner, we saw the restaurant  closed and we had to take the car and come back home very hungry. It was a very disappointing evening and I hope you will give us some money back. I am waiting for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writting for the article about clothes in the future. In my oppinion, in a hundred of years, we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change in clothes, will be the comfortability of them and the way they protect us and our body from temperature and physical agressions. I think they will cold us in the summer and makes us hot in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater with a high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will take  part in clothes development, scientists will search the way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I wish I win the trip! ",25.0
955," Dear Helen I have just received the letter with the result of your competition. I feel really enthusiastic about spending a couple of weeks at Camp California. Unfortunately, as I will be on traineeship in August, I hope this could occur in July. Besides I would prefer staying in a tent. It provides me a feeling of adventure which is very exciting. I'm also very glad to see such a variety of activities  at the camp. It's quite difficult to say wether I prefer painting or sailing. All in all I have never practised Golf nor surfing, so let's try it! Eventually, I would like to know where the camp is located. Will I have the opportunity to visit San Franscico or Los Angles? I would love it! Moreover, how much money will I need if I want to go out at night? These are some further details I keep wondering about. I'm looking for your answer. Yours Sincerely Ignace Cloutier.  [SEP]  Daily life at school: What should be filmed. First of all, I would like to lay the emphasis on the fact that this report can be seen by the director of the school. Therefore it must be objective. Then it may improve our day life at school. It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at the final examination. Then I would like to film the computer rooms. Sometimes there is so much people that you have to wait half an hour to get one computer. If only we could get some new ones. Eventually, it would be nice to make a sequence with lots of sports activities. It would bring some rhythm to the video. Moreover it will show of  healthy the students are. These are some ideas we could discuss over. ",38.0
427," To the Manager of the theatre Dear Sir/Madam I am writing in order to tell your  some things that happened to me at the theatre, at that moment I felt astonish thinking about: ""How  an important theatre have problems like this."" But, Yes. First the starring was going to be Danny Brook, but then another man took his place, I couldn't believe it, you couldn't change Danny Brook, a very important artist, and put a begginer one . It was very disappointing. Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. Yes, 45 minutes, I want to see you in that case. What would you do? I felt like a dumb, and all the people felt like me. And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist. More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was on repairing. At end, I could see that the advertisement said ""Your perfect evening out"", it wasn't the perfect evening, now I'm looking for a layer, because I want my money back, if don't well you know the end of this story. Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to the school, a car stopped at her and a man said ""I know who is your love, it's Peter"". Maria passed all the day thinking about who told them that, there were two posibilities: one her best friend Becca or his sister Pat. But the problem began to increase because all her friends knew her secret. It was like a ""chain reaction"", until Maria didn't want to go to school any more, her mother talked to her, but there was no case, she was very angry and hurt. One day, at his house, she listened  Pat talking with a friend and Maria realised that Pat said everything, because they were talking about a secret of another friend. But there was a problem, how to said it to Pat, in a good or in a bad way, she decided for the good one. Obviously, Pat first refused , but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologyse  Maria, after then Pat never again talked about someone within his or her permission. The End. ",21.0
314," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing with regards to the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' and I am going to complaining about it. I saw it last Friday and it was disappointing me because the actor was not the same man as  the advertisement ad I had expected to see him so I couldn't enjoy myself at all. Secondly, it didn't start at seven thirty. I don't know if there was some problems but I had to wait for forty-five minutes. I could not believe it! In addition to this, I could not get a cheaper ticket so I wonder why the advertisement mentioned about the reduction  tickets. Moreover, despite there were some restaurants in the theatre, they had already closed because it was too late, I wanted to have a coffee but I could not. I should not have gone to see the musical. I do not want to think you told a lie but I felt  to waste my time and money. I would like  to refund all the money and I recommend to thinking about the advertisement. I hope you understand me and the show is going to be succeeded. Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and because of her nasty habit, I lost my best friend and boyfriend at the same time. She was one of my friends and I couldn't trust her at all because she was a truble maker. One year ago, I had a boyfriend and he was a perfect man for me. I was happy at that time and I met  with him almost every day. I believed that I  get married to him although my happiness didn't last. One day, Pat gave me a ring and she told me that my best friend was going out with my boyfriend in secret. I couldn't believe her because my best friend was a boy! I was too shocked to eat anything. I tried to avoid thinking about it but I couldn't. I dared to ask him and he told me his truth. It was true! I shouldn't have asked him! And then I asked him to split up with my best friend but to make matters worse, he chose my best friend! If I didn't hear from Pat anything, I could have got married  him. I couldn't do anything and two month later, my boyfriend got married to my best friend. I felt sad and miserable. ",37.0
1155," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter. It's a shame that I won't see Richard because of his illness, but I'm willing to help you as much as I can. Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter. Firstly, about your accomodation, our college which I belong to offers visitor free accomodations with full of facilities. (for example bath, car park, free internet access, etc.) They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk. Secondly, as you know we'll have a party after the conference, which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals. This party is unlikely to be that formal, but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners. At last, if you have  free time for  couple of ours, you'd better visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train. That is  very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there. I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture. By the way, if you have any other questions, please send me a letter again.  [SEP]  Oh Baby, I can't live without you! These days, we've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented. In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how much convinient  life we've got , what is more, how much inconvinient our grandparents had got. How nasty we are! Let us try to appreciate thier importance again. As for me, the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer. I have been a full time student in the university at home, and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times. When you take the class on computer programming, you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys. My professor said 'go and get familier with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'. I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione. That's the nature of human being. But, I think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate  in our life. ",22.00
1066," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you first of all to thank you about the good programme that you give us about the trip in London, especially for planning to visit the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest to including this point in the programme. The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we fained it very interesting, because we will have the opportunity to see mews, firstly about the latest fashions, secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make up and hairstyles. In addition of this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for the students it is completely free. We were thinking that meaby we can go early to visit the Science Museum and than go to the Central Exhibition , where the event is going to have place! We really look forward to receiving your answer as soon as possible! Thank you very mutch! Your sincerely,  [SEP]  We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people. Of course I must agree with the opinion of my class - mates: famous people, such as actors, singers or politicians, deserve to have a private life, but of course it is not always like this! Almost the time they have journalists following them everywhere and all the time, looking for  great news or interesting pictures to put on the first page of the newspaper, and I don't think this is very nice, but  is the price that famous people have to pay, just becouse they are popular. Anyway, this is not always necessary a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, becouse  let people talking about him and increase his popularity. In conclusion, I can say that this is not the bigger problem that the world has and -- it is not my problem becouse I am not famous! ",29.00
300," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you because of the unpleasent evening I have spent recently. I have always thought that  plays of the Circle Theatre are worth of seeing, but two days before I was very disappointed after visiting yours theatre. Ealyer I had seen an advertisement for the show but the informationes on it caused fals. First of all I have not seen my favourite actor Danny Brook. The second think is that the play did not start at 19:30 but at 20:15! I could not get a discount. The last think is that it was unpossible to get  the theatre restaurant because it was closed. I was told that it had been painted but nobody had written it on an advertisement. At the end I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Modern technology is changing  world every day. I would like to write  how it has influented my daily life. I am a student of a technical univercity. Some time before I did not know  the internet. When I neaded some informationes I had to go to  liblary to find it in books or newspapers. Now the only think I have to do is to go to  computer room and turn on the computer. The computer is helpfull when I want to contact somebody very fast. I just send an e-mail and that is all! The second think is that when I neaded a phone card to call somebody I had to stay in a long queue. Now I just only put some money into a machine and I can take the card from there! The last example is that I have in my house a lot of modern equipment like  TV set, fridge or microwaves which help me for my living. It is obvious that modern technology has changed my daily life.

Without any doubt,   a hystorical place which provides it's visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of the greek history  during the passing of  centuries. Don't miss the chance to visit the hystorical museum, located in the heart of the capital city. A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century. The hystorical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what  greek have always considered as  main principal: their freedom. There are five diffrent floors, each of them presents a diffrent chronical period of greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding to the revolution of 1967. The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing, famous paintings having as  main subject the revolution of 1821, and aspects of the greek religion that has always  considered to be  vital part of greek history.

208," Dear Sir/Madam, Recently I had a week's holiday in London. During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"", the ""London's newest and best musical show."" I have to admit that  was my great mistake. Never before had I  such a disappointing evening. First of all, there was an old, ugly, and unknown actor in the main part instead of  brilliant Danny Brook! To make matters worse, the show started at 20.15, although the advertisement was saying it would begin at 19.30. Moreover, there weren't any discounts, and I had to pay much more for my ticket than I had expected. And on the top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack. You can imagine how upset I am at having suffered such discomfort and disappointment. It wasn't a ""perfect evening out"" at all! That is why I expect at least half the ticket price back. I hope you will give this matter your immediate consideration. Otherwise I'll have to apply to  court for aid. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in  future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100. Of course, those new material won't be so harmful for our health as today's nylon and other things like that. On the other hand, people tend to wear natural clothes today, made of cotton, wool . This tendency may result in turning down synthetics at all. And it is even more difficul to predict how the clothes of the future will look like. People's  fantasy is enormous. Anyway, we'll give up wearing fur coats as it is cruel and uncivilised. ",30.0
600," Mrs Ryan, It had been a real joy to receive your  and I still can't believe it. In answer to your letter, you will find below the informations you need. I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel on July. I can't change anymore the date of umployment because I signed the contract a month ago: I hope it will not make problems to you. For accomodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin, it would be better to let money or anything  without thinking of theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I never have the opportunity to discover this sport. When I saw  you propose this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've done sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I was  sailing teacher on summers the past few years. Does Camp California provide all  clothes for sailing? Do I need to bring  money from Home? Or can I retire some at Camp California? Thank you very much. G Morin  [SEP]  Life at school is made of several things. first, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us . But there are also a lots of clubs and activities that take part in the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make. The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real, concrete. for example, the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting. And especially the practical work. It would be great if we show it in our film, it might be also very interesting to watch it. For other activities, we could probably show a training one of our sport team. For example the team basketball which has won the student regional tittle (we can also say it) or the team of football. After all, it is not important the one we will show. but I think we must give a good picture of the school with sport. ",26.0
1103," Dear Mr. Robertson, As you are probably aware of our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have made us a very nice schedule. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but due to the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class asked me to propose a change in our schedule. This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases on sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would be having fun, meeting the locals and practising our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school. The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show. Our free time on Wednesday could be spent in the Museum. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie Dear Sarah, I'm sorry it took me so long to write you back, but I have being very busy lately: Anyway, on your last letter you asked me whether. Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie would be or not a good present for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea! You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones  you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Specially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published. Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holidays. My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go into College.

If it would be possible I wish I travel in July because I have planned my holidays this month at work and I would not be able to remove them for accommodation, I would choice the log cabin, I am not very fond of ""adventure"", that is why tents are not for me. I expect that these two weeks will be as a big rest. Third, you need to know which sport I want to to practise. I would choice photography and tennis. In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera... (I guess that you shouldn't borrow some! About tennis, I play for eight years and I am used to sit for competition. To finish, I wonder if I need to bring some money or if all has been already payed  and what kind of clothes should I bring? Yours sincerely Joachim Delerm  [SEP]  Our engineer school is specealized in mecanics and thermodynamics. Needless to said that we must faces our attention to these fields. First, we could film  fluid mecanics lessons and  general mecanics lessons. I wonder if we could not feet between some short view of the laboratories, in which we could show  student making experimentations. In order to strike people who will watch the film, we could record  student drawing on the big drawing tables. I would do the same for thermodynamics. Nevertheless, we should not forget the extra-life school. We have to show sports at school and all  activities that we are offered. There are not only the brain which should be trained. Futur students could appreciate to come if they could still practise their sport. Another point to record woubl be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time, it will show a part of the way of life in the school.

First of all, you state in the letter that the accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents because I like being in contact with the nature life. Secondly, from the list of activities that you are also state in the letter I would prefer swimming because when I was a child I practised this sport for 8 years. In addition, I would prefer photography too because I love taking photos. Finally, it would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of clothes I must be taken and how much I will spend during the stay at the Camp.

First I didn't accept but finally she conviced me. It was the most excited experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drinks. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepare orange juices. It was grateful because I knew a lot of people and the most important person was Alex, the baterist of the group. You know he is my love!

325," 10 June 2000 Dear Manager, I would like to complain about your theatre and the musical show that I saw last week. I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about 'Over the rainbow' in the hotel which I stayed . I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited. However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time. I was really disappointed about it. Secondly,  starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes. It was so long time to wait in the theatre. Thirdly, it mentioned about discounts. Despite of the fact that I am a student, I could not get any discounts. I also visited your restaurant after the show but   already closed because the show finished late. Because of the reason above, I, indeed, spent  awful last night in London. I would like you to refund, otherwise, I will take an action. I look forward to receiving  reply to my enquiry. Sincerely  [SEP]  Fashion of the future People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years later from now. If  weather is hot then we don't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies. There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes like layer and layer. For example, T-shirts for women are included  bra: easy to take it out when you wash it,   is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it. Simplest is the best in summer! When it's very cold  winter, we just wear light clothes what we want, in our style. Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and use them inside thin clothes so we don't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies. We can show our body line in winter as well. Most important thing is that we don't have to kill the animals only for people's cruel aims. Functions' clothes are the way to love animals! ",29.0

I will take my exams in June and have the result in August. So I shall stay to prepare for my university. Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chance to be with other people, then I can make more friends. During the camp, I will do sing and climbing activities. I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with the others. I also like climbing because I like the view on the top of hills.

The aim of this report is to give the suggestion of which lessons and activities should be filmed. Lessons and Activities  Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students talk about some topics they choose and discuss  with others in order to prove their speaking and listening skills. Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up-dated. The teacher use video,  pictures to show students about festivals, sports, museums, ect. It is popular by the students. Canteen is the place students stay together apart from class. Quite a lot of students spend their free time there for relaxing and talking. Basketball is the most popular activity, whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week. Not only the students who have activity play but also a lot of students watch.

As the letter said that all questions you would like to know, I'm going to give you in the following: Firstly I would like to travel in July only because I have two months holiday which are July and August, I choose July because it is the only one month that I think I'm free. In August I have to work so. Secondly I prefer the tents because I've never been in that tent so I would like to try. Thirdly for the activities I would like to chose climbing and photography, I have never done them before. The only reason is I would like to try and I think they are matching activities, when you climb up the mountain then you can take the photograph of the views. Eventually I would like to ask you, are about money and clothes. How much do I have to bring the money? And what is the weather like? which  I could bring them to be match the weather. Yours sincerely Sintawichai Chaow  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping is when human goes to the shop and buy what they went, however I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes  all sort of things. Anyway shopping is not always enjoyable as the title  because firstly you will get tied because you have to walk out and in the shops. Secondly you will get angry on  bad treatment of the sellers in the shop. Thirdly if you're fat you won't find you size. Forthly that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy to much things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by your self. I think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it, do not go shopping give the money to charity, that is better than shopping. For me my opinions on this one  is true it is boring, it might  because I am a boy. ",23.0
438," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Now Marion was really angry with her. Some days ago Pat met her friend Paul, the editor of the school's newspaper. Paul asked her some questions about her childhood and her toys because he was going to write an article about children. While Pat was talking she remembered playing with her dolls and spending a good time with them. Then Paul asked her if she knew something about Marion's childhood. Pat told him some unimportant things such as she learnt to swim at the age of five or that she loved ants. But, suddenly, she started to talk about Marion's toys. She told Paul she had a special toy called Max and that she slept with him. A terrible mistake! In the following edition the headline was: ""Why  a teenager sleeps with a toy called Max?"" Everybody laughted at her. Marion felt really embarrassed. Two weeks later everybody forbade about Marion's secret and she took into account her relationship with Pat. They became friends again. But Marion would never tell Pat a secret again!! ",37.0
199," Dear Sir/Madame, I am writing to complain about your musical show which  performed last Friday. I was interested in your advertisement and I booked the friday show while I had been on holiday. However, this theatre made me disappointing from starting the show until  finishing. First of all, I saw that the discounts were available, but there were not any discounts and advantages for the audience. Also the show started at 20:15 delaying for more 45 minutes than the advertise mentioned. I could bare it by the time. Moreover the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but he actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed by the excuse  to be repaired. In fact, the notice had been showed since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people. In conclusion, I was very disappointed in a whole of the show, furthermore, I could not enjoy my holiday after the show. Therefore, I would like  to refund some money. I look forward to recieving your prompt reply. Yours faithfully, Sun-Young Lee.  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future. Return to the Nature. The World is being Changed rapidly by developing technology and industrial. It affect   lots of ways. One of them is   fashion area. people think that we will wear a simple, practical, light clothes. For instance, we can see that kind of clothes in sci-fi films like Starwars. however, in the other hand, there is a different idea. People like designer's clothes like Armani, Chanel..  so on. They prefer new original style in order to show them more attractive. Moreover, most designers prefer to use natural material. They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things  than chemical one. In my opinion, people want to wear special and original clothes to show their own characters. Also countless fashion will be shown. People will prefer to use more natural than chemical things and wear more beautiful and attractive clothes. I think that showing their beauty is one of animal's basic instincts. I can't stand wearing a suit or kit like  which has been showed in Starwars! ",25.0
873," Dear miss Ryan, With reference to your letter of  13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me. I am pleased to provide you with the following information. Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July. I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor-sleeping really makes me happy. Concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it, for the second activity I would like to enroll  surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient , keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners group. I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that period of time, the kind of currency I should take with  as well as the vaccination requirements. I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your help. Yours faithfully Abril Botella  [SEP]  Benoni's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels, Belgium. It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computer, make up, languages, geographie to culture and civilization. Students start their day at the Gym, where they learn the importance of being fit, that is way I suggest to film this activity. Once students have taken a shower after a hard physical training they come to real life, depending on their levels  they have to study for instance languages wich I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism field because these enables stuff to communicate with clients in a proper way, students have to manage to speak at least three languages. Another important lesson to film is ""culture and civilization, therefore people will know that the hostessess prepered at this school are not only, as  French say, ""pot-au-fleurs"", beautiful faces to show off but also well read persons. Last but not less important is the class called ""know-how"" wich shows students how to cope with unspected problems even if they are in stress. I would also take an outdoor lesson ""training"". The school works together with known companies of the branch  as Mariot hotel, Air France Princess cruise among others in order to provide students with high qualified training. ",35.0
334," Dear Manager, I am writing in order to complain about the Musical Show, OVER THE RAIN, I went to see to the theatre. In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook, and to my surprise it was a different actor, and it realy disapoint me. Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour later. I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there werent. And the restorant of the theatre was being pait, so I could not go  as you said in the advertisment. As you may undertand it was not a perfect night and I am not pleased with the show on eaven with your services. That is why I am going to ask you  my money back. I am look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Tecnology, are we prepeared for those advances? It change every days and I do not know if we will be able to understand it. Tecnology improves our lives, we have tecnology for cook, for work, for study, well hardly for everything. Mostly all of us, today know what  is internet about, but one or two year ago we did not. And when we understand  internet, we thought that meeting people from other countrys and could ""chat"" with them, was the top of the tecnology. But now we can eaven watch his face ,  Internet is amaizing. and now of courese there will  someone trying to improve it. Tecnology change our daily life, it makes our life easily to live and of courese more confortable like with computers, televitions, radios etcetera and some times more secure like in medicine. Definitly we should try to understand tecnology, if we know how to use it, tecnology will improve our way of life. ",22.0
405," Dear Sir of Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was presented by The Circle Theatre last week. I saw the performance and it was not like it was mentioned in the advertisent I read in the local newspaper. First of all, the main actor was not Dany Brook as it was expected so. That was very disappointing. Secondly it must have started at 14.30 and ended by 19.30. However, it started at 20.15. I had to wait almost an hour. Then, I was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true, so I just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show. Finally, I was thinking  to have dinner in the threatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees. What was suposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time. So I would be greatful if you payed for a full refund of the money I spent in the tickets. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Computers, radio, CD's, sattelite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life. Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life, and it has some advantages as  some disadvantages. On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school. What I mean is that computers are very useful  to do my homework (like some monographies or researching). And I can't even think about how it would be  not having a computer. Another advatage is that, for example sattelite television, which is an example of modern technology, makes me be informed about what is happening on the whole world. On the other hand, I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult. The best example is the homework I have to do for school, I can't manage to do it when I don't have my computer to help. In addition to that, technology doesn't sometimes let me develop my imagination and creative skills. My mother says that I'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V. instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities. To sump up, I can't think about how my life would be  without technology. ",30.0
146," Dear Sir, I'm writing to complain for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I've been recently seeing  in your theatre during my week's holiday in London  I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was the London's newest and best musical show  I  had ever seen because of the good publicity you made  in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong! Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later as I expected! If the spectacle has been beautiful, I would have been quite pleased to wait. Then, I had read that there would have been discounts available, but it wasn't true! So it's better not to write anything if you don't make it  true then. Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change of  programme:  starring! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. Finished the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this hasn't been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed: the chef went away after he received a phone call! For all these reason, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon! A suggestion? Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  There would be many things to say about . Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I must say  technology has changed our life in  positive  or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we  make a phone call with an astonish rapidity, instead at my grandparents' time it took one month or more to have  contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When appeared the first car, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else he wants! What can I say about the television? It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which happened or will happen. In the not very far 1914, parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible! Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community, not only phisically. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power. We became passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed. I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality. Finally, everyone should decrease his own life's rythm. ",29.0
164," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you for explaining some problems I had when I went to the theatre to see one of your company's musical shows called ""Over the rainbow"". I would like to say that the information given in your advertisement was not true at all. First of all, the main characters had to be Danny Brook an Tina Truelove. I got very disappointed when I discovered Danny Brook was not going to play  and a different actor would play  instead of him. Another problem was  the start of the show. When I finished working I had to hurry up because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. For my surprise, when I arrived to the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait  long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15! You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information. For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts, but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available. When the show was over I went to have dinner to your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacked of employees. In conclusion, what I expected to be ""my perfect evening"", as you said in your advertisement, was a very disappointing evening due to the problems I had. I would like to know if I could have some money back for these problems I have told you . I advise you to pay more attention in your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, MANUEL SANTOS  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret, our important secret. I wish I had never told her anything. All began when, three days ago, I was doing  homework in my class. I was alone because Pat had to go with her parents to the cinema. Suddenly, I heard step noises that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher went out the class. I was boried, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. ""See you tomorrow!"" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my class I saw he hadn't switched off the light of his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had forgotten our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do  next day were there. Without thinking it twice, I took one of them and went quickly home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which were the questions of the exam. When I told her this piece of news, she got surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell it anybody else. Next day in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams. But my plan didn't work well. Next day, everybody knew about my great finding because Pat hadn't kept our secret. The problem was that my teacher also knew  it because someone had told him ""the story of the exams"", as he called my big problem. He told me I had done wrong taking the exam but I think the only thing I did wrong was telling Pat my important secret. Next time I will get sure  who I'm telling my secret to. ",36.0

From your letter I was pleased to know that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. But could you, please, let me have more details about my award. What kind of people will be invited at your Camp in this summer? I would like to know with whome I'll share sach a wonderful days with the sport activities. About sport... I must be honest: I'm not very keen on sport. But I will be glad to  swimming and sailing for some weeks. I have been learnt to paint. And I would prefer to have a nice audience for my poetry as well, I'm a poet, yeas. I would be choose a month  July, because I'm free in this time from family's duties. What about another camp conditions - it does not matter for me. I can stay in tents or log cabins, how you wish. Sent me, please, news about July. Yours sincerely Fu-Su Harp  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I hope that you  still OK and now are preparing for me a new nice letter! I hope so! I have been written to you that my life in London was a little bit boring for me. It was true. But now all things became absolutly changed! I found the kind of activity what I looking for four ages. My Russian friend ivited me to set up a new exiting business. We established a firm which has a deal with musicians and contemporary pop stars. Can you imagine! First of all, in order of our firm purpose I wrote an inventation to my favorite idol - a poet and a singer Boris Grebenchekoff. We were renting for him a special hall near Piccadilly Circus. The hall was crowded. His one-week concert programme was so succsessful that we decided to invite him else, as soon as  tickets would be  sold. I had a nice expirience as manager too. I would like to be a professional in this stage, yeas. Do you share my idea, Kim? Is not it a brilliant idea? You know, Kim, I'm always looking for purpose of human being. Not only - to LIVE, but to have something to LIVE FOR. Now I did my choice. Good luck to you as well! P.S. Your present, a small toy, a white hose - I always keep with me, it helps me to pass my exams. With Love - ",20.0
744,"  Misses Helen Ryan, First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel. You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accomodation I would like to have and so on. Travelling in July, I have to say, would be perfect for me because I have got my birtday the 24th of this month and I wish I could spend my birtday as well as possible, so it means there. I also would prefer to sleep into  tents which are more comfortable and, because I have been doing lots of campings, I am quite used to this kind of accomodation. The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me. Painting and swimming are my way to spend a good time especially on holiday. I may have a question for you to answer, please could you tell my how much money do I need to bring with me? Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. However it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more, it is very fashionable those times. They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do. Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway. Is it enjoyable to walk around shops, looking at nice stuff, without having enough money to spend on it? Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance? Enjoying shopping isn't the reason for doing that. I think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human being. ",25.0
1032," Basle, 12th Decembre 2000 (Your English class N3c) Dear Mr Robertson, We have received the programme. We'd like to thank you for organising  good programme, especially the shopping tour on Tuesday. Our class is especially interested in  latest fashion and trends. London is a good place for discovering it. We've seen an advertisement for 'the London Fashion and Leisure Show' and all of us are very interested in it. It's an exhibition of fashions, sport wears, make up and hairstyles. We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who like to study fashions after leaving this school. And everyone of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in  Central Exhibition Hall, London. We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday,  14th of March. Could we change our programme? We'd like to do our shopping tour on  next following day (Wednesday afternoon) instead of Tuesday afternoon. What do you think about our suggestion? Please write back as soon as possible. We hope to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Basle, 12th Decembre 2000 Dar Oxana, Thanks for your letter. It's nice to hear from you again. In your letter, you asked me wheter the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday. It's my pleasure to write my suggestion for you now! You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of  English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it. Why? Because he especially concentrates on  history, social life and politic situation in the time the story is played. That might be quiet complicated to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him! I've send you a copy of the summary from the book and an interesting article about the author and the book. Please read it and write your comments. I hope to hearing from you soon! Have fun with it and say hello to your cousin! See you soon! Love, ",16.00
952," Dear Helen Ryan, I have recieved your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize. I have answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th  July is my birthday. I want to sleep in tents because I think it's more adventurous  better scenery, and atmosphere. You also asked me about the two things I'm good at, well, the first one is basketball. I have been playing basketball for roughly about 4 years. I love basketball because I'm good at it and it is my favourite sport. The other thing I'm good at is tennis. I have been practcing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16 U.S open tour last summer. Last of all I have questions to ask you. Would I have to bring many clothes e.g. would we do a lot of outdoor activities, get dirty etc. Would I need a lot of money. Looking forward to see you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This composition is about shopping. People today shops sevendays a week with their family, friends etc. But I think shopping is not always enjoyable. This statement is due to the great amount of rubbish we are providing for the world. The more stuff we buy the more we throw away. Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money. Therefor you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy. You can enjoy yourself in other different ways. For example, you can do sports which is enjoyable and good for your health. Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports which is for your own benefit. You must think about your children who would be living in the world you helped to destroy. The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt. I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your view in looking at shopping. ",31.0
396," To whome it may concern, I am writing to tell  that I had a very disappointing evening regarding a musical show at your theatre. There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out. Firstly, the advertisement told that Danny Brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out  a completely different person which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper. Secondly, according to the advertisment, the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15 which caused me a trouble. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said so in the advertisement, however, it was not actually available which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant which was recommended in the advertisement, however, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation which I thought was very unprofessional. With all the dissatisfuction above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it would have to be. I hope that you will consider this letter seriously and try to improve your service. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How did we know that she was that kind of person? Well, it all begun when Pat's friend, Molly, went down to London... Molly went down to London for  shopping and as she was walking  the street. She found  familier faces on the other side of the street. It was Vance and Sally whom she had not seen for ages. Pat, too, are  friend of them and has seen them  time to time. Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they have been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their own time . After Molly went back home in Aberdeen, she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London. Then suddenly, Pat's face turned to look confused and  said in a small voice, 'Haven't they broken up  long time ago? Sally must have a new boy friend'. As Molly didn't know this, she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it. Then, Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept as a secret but it just came out of her mouth! She didn't mean to do so, but this kind of thing happens a lot. Now Pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because Molly isn't good at keeping secrets either! Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and the Poor Vance is always the last person to know it.  ",32.0
1058," To: The Principal of Westminster College, Mr Robertson. From: Eirini X FCE Student Dear Sir, I am writing to you with a request for a change in the scedule of our trip to London. But, first of all, I would like to thank you for the time and the effort you have made to organize the entire programme. Everything seams very interesting and I am sure that we will all have a very good time. Unfortunatly I have to suggest a change for the programme of Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the ""Fashion and Leisure Show"" takes place that date in London. All of the students - including my self, think of this as a great opportunity that  would be  pitty to be missed, especially when students can enter for free. According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show. I hope that you will find this possible. With best regards  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had to try my limits for once again. This is my nature. I had to see how far I could go this time or, to be more specific, how high! I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumpping in my vains, full of adrenaline, tolet myself free to shake, from excitement. There were my thoughts when I first saw the advertisement for a ""Sky Dive"". I didn't hesitate much. The same afternoon I picked up the phone and I gave them a call. That was it. The following Sunday I fint my self on a plain flying 20000ft from the ground. When the time for the jump came I had some second thoughts. But then, I thought of the birds again - of how nice it would be to share their world for a few minutes and, I jumped! Well, danger is in my nature an Life is nothing but an adventure. ",37.00
542," Dear Sir. Thank you very much for informing me  I've won the prize. To let you arrange the details of your programe, I'm going to give my answers to you. Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already resistered  another summer course which starts in the end of July. Sorry about that but I can make that travel only in July. About accomodation, I prefer in tents to log cabins. Because I haven't used tents for ages so this time, I want to have tents for 2 weeks which will remind me of my childhood with my family. I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in  Sates. I might have lots of chances to take photos of beautiful nature. So I'm longing to take part in that activity, photography. Actually I've been in  amature photographer's organization for 3 years. And I'd like to choose swimming as the other one. I learned swimming at my age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming. At that time, I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strocks. Finally, could you let me know how the weather is like in July in  States? Then I can prepare my clothes suitable for that weather. And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accomodation. Thanks loads Yours sincerely Kyon Chwa  [SEP]  All the students in my class are excited about that work and now we're in the process of discussion about what will be filmed. Some students suggested very brilliant ideas. We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time. The lessons we have in the morning doesn't attract us very much, but this bit will show you  routine scenery of a lesson. Spoken English lessons which is in the afternoon are quite interesting. Every  students keep talking about he theme and give their opinions. So we're going to organize about 10 minutes' short debate just for this video, but we haven't decided when it will be and the subject. After the class is also  very essential part of school life. Because we go to the pub which is situated near to the school quite often and we talk more about personal stories that make us closer, the pub after the lessons will be interesting. If you don't mind, we want to film  teachers' room as well. Your preperation for lessons, everyday chats and so on. If you allow us to film those things, we'll be very happy. When things become more obvious and more things are decided, I'll report again. ",31.0
287," Dear Sir/Madam, I saw the musical show in your advertisment in my holiday. I was disappointed with it. I would ask you to my money back. First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but actually, starting was not Danny Brook but another person. Besides her acting didn't make me satisfied. Secondly,  starting time was not 19:30 but 20:15. Because of it, I was waited for a long time, Also, there was no system that ticket can be discounted. Finally, I went to  restaurant in your theatre but it was closed, I couldn't eat anything. That's  nub of my complaints. Thus I spent  terrible time - it was  waste of time. I'm expecting for your reply soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  'Fashion of the future, I think after 100 years, at least something will change in the point that design, material, color, etc. If I pick up the example,  Kimono (Japanese traditional cloth) will wear on not only Japan but also  another countries in generally. Also it will be only wear but its design, shape might take in casual cloth. If it came true, imagination to make cloth would bigger and could think various design and format. By one country's traditional cloth taking in those of another country, it can born different type and new kind of fashion. On the other hand, there might vanish  personality (character) of each country. However, thinking way that simple is the best will not change. Also, comfortable cloth for person will maintain in the future. I guess the good things will not change forever. ",16.0

Could you, pleas send me some extra information regarding the ammount of money I should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes I should take. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Is shopping not always enjoyable? There are different opinions and points of view. I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food . For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive. The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style  buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time. The third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe. Although my brother thinks the better way to have fun is to watch TV than to be pushed in crowded shops, I do not agree. To sum up I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it. ",33.0
26," Dear madame Jane Clark, I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago. I was there  two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world. Well, here are some of my opinion and suggestions. First of all, I think there should  more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only from six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world. The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls  to small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent. Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events. Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate  for the great sucess in the festival. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Emily, Hello! It's been such a long time since we wrote to each other. Well, in the letter you wrote me, you asked some questions about school and house rules. Even though, I do have less than you, I'm still willing to change many things. In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either. At home, there are less rules. My parents don't really like putting rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back. But it existed since I was very young. I would like to change the rule  not to speak in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish but I guess to learn. we should speak English all the time. Well, that's all. I hope one day you get to change what you wanted. I miss you and let's keep in touch. Bye.. your Pal, ",32.00
1170," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college. I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel. It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college, where the conference is going to be held. I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus. The bus stop  you should get off is called ""The Green Man"". With reference to the end-of-conference party, which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight, I would like to mention the necessary dress code. It is an evening dress for women and black trousers, a white shirt and a black bow tie for men. Lastly, I would like to give you some suggestions about way in which you can spend your free time in our town. I am strongly convinced, that you should visit  local Science Museum. Also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum. I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As it is widely known, lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century, nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer. It is a fact, that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information. Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants, designers, engineers and so on and on. Another point in  favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet. It allows you to have all the necessary information ""on your fingertips"". Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world, which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment. To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries wouldn't have been so concerned about  so-called ""problem 2000"" if the computer had not been so important for the modern society.

849," 13th June, 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, I recived your letter and I am very excited about the camp. I would like to go in July I don't mind wich two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I  still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family. I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it's different from where I sleep every night so I would apreciate it if there are still tents available. One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing, I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better in it. The other activity I would like to take is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years. I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take  money with me. Thanks for your attentions. Yours sincerely, Ma. Anni Soler  [SEP]  13th June, 2000 Dear Kim, Hello girl how are you doing this days. I am great especially last weekend in the concert of Backstreet Boys. It was so exciting. They were giving two concerts one in Friday and the other one in Saturday they invited me to go on friday. This is what happened: when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery, then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the courtines (opening and closing) when Nick came  to me and ask me to go on stage with him, my heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day. Well I have to go now. Hope to hear from you later on. Love, Anni. ",31.0
352," To the manager of the Circle Theatre - London Dear sir, I write to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" I saw last night. Firstly I was very disappointed in finding out that not-ever-heard actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected. Besides this, no discounts for students were available. I'm very sorry to let you know that not only was the show really boring, but it started also 45  late - This shouldn't happen! In addition to this, I heard bad singers and noticed a numertable lack of variety in  ballets. Furthermore I couldn't drink a cup of coffee after the show in the theatre restaurant. I've been told it was closed because of a waiters' strike. I know this is not up to you, but it was very annoying. This show might be the newest in London, but   not the best at all. I do eventually think it would be fair to give the spectators their money back - So  ask you  a complete refund (cash) of the ticket price. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We all know that she isn't good in keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time. Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days. Their parents were so happy that  decided to give him a fantastic present: the brand new car he had always dreamed of. This should be a big surprise for him: the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush-hush atmosphere. Pat promised not to speak to anyone about the car, but one evening Philip overhead her speaking about this with her boyfriend ""It will be delievered on Thursday! Can you imagine Philip's face when he'll see his favourite car out there?"" He couldn't believe his ears! The great day came. The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual  activity all over the house. Everyone seemed to be looking for something. ""Are you looking for these?"" asked Philip showing the keys of the car. And  disappeared heading for the rear door. ",36.0
1226," Dear Mrs Smith. I am writing to you to give you the information about the conference. The hotel your group has been booked into is called  Palace Hotel. It is simple to find the way from this hotel to the conference. You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel. There you will find a modern building with two different doors a red  and a blue one. You are asked to take the blue door. After entering you will see the signed conference room. We organized a end-of-conference party on the day before your departure. Everyone is welcome to join   this party   to get to know each other in a good atmosphere. You should wear nice and comfortable cloth. This is an informal party. I suggest you visiting the old part of Zurich or going to the zoo before your departure. I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference. If there is any question left, please contact me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Most Important Invention I love baking cakes, cockies and breads. Baking is  passion and in the town  I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area. It doesn't matter in what kind of mood I am, I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good. But I couldn't bake without an oven. I'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion. I think the oven is one of the most important inventions. If there is someone who doesn't agree with me, he or she should try to live  one month without using the oven. Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys. I'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes. I'm thanking the person who invented the oven. Thank you! ",36.00
1144," Dear Mrs Brown, I am writing to give you information about Mr Brown's surprise party. First of all, the reason that we decided to do this party was because Mr Brown helped to the organisation of our trip to France. And we preciate  to not tell him about our party. Secondly, the party it is on Tuesday 16th pm at the College Canteen. As concerned the food, our mothers they will help about that.

The executive calls me on the office, and he has show me my office. From, that day, every day I was gone to the office 30 minutes before. When I complete a month to this job my executive he tell to John to go to the office. I was surpised because I did not know what he wanted. When I went his wants to tell me that from the next month I will be his personal secratary and my salary it will be the double how  the previous. I cannot believe it. Now, my life it is in the best way it would be thought about. And every day when I wake up I think that I live in the dream which I never want to finish. ",22.0
172," Dear Mr Jones, I'm writting this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle theatre. Firstly In the advertisement you said that the actor would be Danny Brook but there was a different actor in the show and I was really disappointed, because I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook which I personally admire. Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were being told but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed because of renovation. Finally there were no discounts available in the tickets. All the above made my night terribly disappointing and I must say that the advertisement is nothing but a business fraud, so I'm in the unpleasant position  to ask  my money back. I'm looking forward to your reply Yours sincerely Mrs Lemmings.  [SEP]  Technology is an essential part in people's life. It's something absoletuly necessary for every action people does It effects us both positive and negative. It's a part of our lifes. Firstly technology has created a bond between myself and my computer. I got used to spending 2-3 hours in front of the computer. My relationship with my family and friends doesn't even exist. I've end up being a T.V addict Also the need of doing simple things as a family is no longer the case. Why going to the countryside if you can sit there with a bowl of popcorns and watch T.V. Despite the negative effects, technology can effect with a positive way a person's life. Air conditions, watches, computers, and many other things have made my life easier. There's no need on going to the shops when I can order things by the computer. Air conditions also makes my life easier In addition technology has made my life easier but it's also an intrude in my life crating a distance between myself and my family. In my opinion technology is the least thing I could use in my life. ",30.0
585," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, i am writing to reply  your questions about me. Firstly, I would like to thank you abut this big opportunity you give me to visit this wonderful place like California. I would like to travel only in July because my boss can not give me a leaving for the other months of Summer. Also, I prefer to stay in  tents because I think it is a good chance for me to live with the nature and to wake up listening birds which  singing. It will be nice! Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose. To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing. I'm good in both of these. I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like a lot music and everybody tells me that I have a good voice. I would like ask you about the weather. I want to know if I should bring warm clothes or not and how much money. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, how are you? Thanks for you letter. It was good to hear from you now. As you know this Summer I really enjoy myself doing things I like a lot. Last month, Alice and her friends proposed  me   to help at a pop concert. The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future. All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to control during it about the sound. The concert lasted four hours and in the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the concert of ""Savage Garden"" in live and because that night was the best of my life. But the thing I particularly liked about my experience, was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with the people so famous. OK! That's all for now. I'm waiting for your letter. See you soon, Margaret xxx P.S. I hope you will find the spare time to visit my country this Summer. ",30.0
575," June 5, 2000 Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am writing this letter because I would like to express my happiness. This is the first time I won a prize in these kind of competitions so I would like to clear some doubts. First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work  and my parents wish to see me in this month, so if it is possible to arrange the date it would be very nice. Second, I use to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer if it is possible to be in  tents, because it would be a original experience . Third, I love playing basketball, I am a great player and I play with my University and I like to be playing all the time so this activity I will not missed. The other activity would be surf. I think  is very cool and I want to learn. Finally, I want to know what kind of clothe I will need and if have to take  money for shops or markets. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerly, Jason Andre.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. You have to be all the time walking, so your legs will feel pain, hurted at the final of the day, you will be very tired and you would want to hang around for two months. If I go alone  is very fast and I enjoy it but if I go with my mother it would be horrible, I will have to do a sacrifice. I will have to be waiting until my mother decides which is the best place to buy her dress. She will see if it is pretty or not, if it is in discount at other store we will not buy the dress and we will have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but at the final of seeing all the stores and looking  all the dresses she will decided for the first  we saw. It is horrible. Is like a nightmare. ",18.0
545," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to giving  information about myself. Even though I would like to travel, I am only  in July, because I am a high school student. Thus I have not got  long holiday. I just have one month left. Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents. On accound  to stay in log cabins are as much more interesting than  in tents. As far as two activities are concerned I would choose singing and photography. I used to win a number of competitions in singing. I can sing a plenty of songs. which include the english song and the japenese song, and I have  part-time job for sining at  restaurant. Although the photography is not as good as the singing, I am very interested in it. I have been learning  since I was 15 year old. I got third prize in it competition last year and I level is professional now. Futermore, I am going to have  competition next year. I would like to asking  some information about that what kind of clothes I have to wearing and how many your are charge. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable, sometimes have a long quare or a mechine was broken. A lot of circumsenses will have been happening. I have  unpleased experience. It was in lunch time. Everybody were went to by luch in  supermarket, in fact, nobody liked crowe and quare, expecially  in the summer time. I was quare in the middle of row. I choose this row because I though it was quicker than  other. Although there were finished two people, next was me, something was happened. Suddenly the customer though the receipt was not truth, she did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make  mistake, they argued about this thing. The shop manager was coming solution it. Abviously, I have to chance other row. I was long quare, I have never had. Shopping would be enjoyable, if you were good luck.

281," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW'. There were some unfortunate incidents. To begin with, according to your advertisement, discount tickets were availabe. However, I could not get them. So I could  get a good seat. In addition to this, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. As a result, I could not visit the restaurant since it had already closed when the show finished. To make matters worse, it was the different actor although Danny Brook should have starred. I was really looking forward to seeing his role, but on starting the show, I found it disappointed. Can you imagine how upset I was? Finally, I would like to ask you to give some money back to me. I look forward to receiving your satisfactory reply by return of post. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life greatly. To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box. When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it with the phone. On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb my time, the phone annoys me. Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention. With  internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad. Since I bought a computer, I have been checking  E-mails from my friend almost every day. Finding them, I feel happy even if there is only one. On balance then, I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it improves too rapidly  to catch up. ",39.0

Firstly, because of my school exam, I would like to travel only  july. Moroever, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine. At Camp California, I hope I will be in  tents because I like very much this kind of style life: I love the contact with the nature. On the other handDuring my stay in Camp California, I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish I am going to sail: I have never try it, but it seems to be great! Finally, I have two questions more: I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming? Yours sincerely. Didier Bovie  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As you asked me in your last letter, I am going to tell you more about the last month's pop concert. Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene. As soon as all the conections was made, we tested the nivel of the sound: I found it too loud, so I advised them to regular it, and they listed to me! Then, there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights: it was just enought time. Thus, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music, even if I don't play any music instrument. Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning the way of using an instrument. Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument. See you soon. Best wishes Didier Bovie ",27.0
398," Dear Sir or Madame, I was on  week's holiday in London and I went there to the theatre to see ""Over The Rainbow"". I must say that your musical show was very disappointing for me. ""Over The Rainbow"" was looking very interesting on your advertisement but  organisation and play was almost terrible. First of all I expected to see Danny Brook, but I saw  different actor and that was  big disappointment for me. Secondly the show started at quarter past eight. This is  fourty-five minutes delay. Moreover there was not any discounts and all of the tickets had the same prizes. Out the end your theatre restaurant was closed from unknown reasons, but on an advertisement  was clearly sign: ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"". That was cruel, because I was very haungry after the show. At the end of this letter I would like to ask if you can refund my money. I will be very pleased if  so. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Twentieth century was a century of inventions. Some of them are big and some of theme are small, but they effect our lives in the same way. Technology maked our life different than  life of people for example living in  nineteenth century. Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better. Often people do not see how it effects our life style. Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers, Hi-Fi stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day. They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant. Transport and communication without cars, trains, planes and telephones will not exist. We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors. Without these, and newspapers of course knowing our world could be hard. On the second hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers. On the end we must mention modern medicine. It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases. To sum up modern technology changed our daily life. Mine too. I think that I could not live  normal life without these inventions. They are like  air I breath. I am questioning myselfs - am I  sick man? ",25.0
822," Dear Helen, Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize. It seems so exciting. I really look forward to taking part at Camp California. I would like to travel in July because my examination will be finished on June 15th. And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August. So, I think July is the best time to go for the Camp. In addition, the weather may be nice at that period of time. For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I get used to it. Because I'm not good at sporting, so I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying in the university I joined the Photo Club where I got the knowledge a well as a wide variety of knowhow in taking photo. As I love singing and always spend my free time in Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad. I also have a couple of things to ask you. What type of clothes and how much money do I need to prepare? I would be delightful if you could recommend me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to do shopping a lot when I was in the university. I was 19 years old but I spend over 200 pounds in some weeks just to make myself up-to-date all the time. I bought lots of new fashion clothes, bags and shoes. Four years in the university I never had  saving money. Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young as mentioned so it came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money. I found that it's not worth when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They are very poor. The money that I spent on shopping can help them a lot if I would not do it before. Little grandson tried to help his grandfather who was 70 years old by hiring himself out as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing tell me shopping is not enjoyable any more. ",31.0

However, there is one point that we would like to change in the programme. We are interested in visiting ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" during our travel. The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make up, and also  leisure and sports wear. Furthermore  is totally free for students. All this exhibiots are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence in our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it. We think that we could go there   next 14th of March, in the eveninng, instead of going shopping. This one could be translate to  15th  evening. It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we are totally agree that we don't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum. We truly believe you will consider our change.

On the one hand you find the ones that are well-known and never talk about their privacy. They use the publicity exclusive for their work. On the other hand,  are the ones that are also respectabled but, appart from their relation with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly seek by photographers. I mean, they enjoin being the point of view or the center of everyone, even though it means to see their lifes.

14," To: From: I spent two days at  annual international arts festival from 21 to 22 of November. This festival was well-orginised. There were a lot of activities for everyone. I relly liked  exhibitions. I had a chance to see amazing pictures with wezy painted by Russian painters. There was an excellent jazz concert. The Band ""Three Kings"" apresented  new stily of music. I would like to notice that a dance show was absolutelly marvelous. What's a greit idea to invite writers there! I relly liked to speak with them. From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and  there were artist from only six countries. Nowadays many people  fond of classical music, but this concert was too small that's why many people had to miss this classical concert. You wrote an advertisment  that people from more than 15 deferent countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists only from 6 countries. It was relly  pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy. The International Arts Festival was organised quite well. I would only recomended you to have more artists and a classical concert should be in  bigger hall than it was.  [SEP]  One man and one woman lived in  small house beside the sea.

When he come back home, he was surprise because Maria was more angry than before. She said that it wasn't enough what Gold Fish had done for her. Ivan had to beg Gold Fish again and again. In the end, greedy Maria wanted impossible thing. She said that Ivan should bring Gold Fish to home and Ivan could leave this house because she didn't need him anymore. Maria wanted too much and Gold Fish returned everything at the beginning. Maria and Ivan were again poor.  This story happened a long time ago. ",24.00
526," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show that has recently taken place at the Circle Theatre. The advirtisement I had read did not match the performance. First of all, Danny Brook was not starring and was replaced by a different actor. That was very disappointing. The performance started fourty five minutes later. Moreover, I was unpleasantly amazed  no discounts were available. Furthermore, I would not have complained if the theatre restaurant had been open. According to the advertisement, I could visit it after the show, but it was closed because of the lack of customers. My ""perfect evening out"" was not so perfect and could not satisfy me in any way. From my point of view, the partial refund of the cost of the tickets, which are enclosed with this letter, would completely satisfy my interests. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? Modern technology has  variety of uses and its possibilities are being widened more and more. Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticable. Personally I feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers. Their popularity could be explained by their comfort and easy use. With the help of  ""Internet"" it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in. Computers take  the major part of my free time and this is the reason of disagreements between me and my parents. They would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily routine. I am completely satisfied with the way I spend my freetime, but they have another opinion. In conclusion, modern technology affects everybody, but in different ways. The only effect on me is more often disagreements with my parents. ",29.0
1012," Dear Mr Robertson. Thank you very much for taking us to London. This is a big opportunity to discover the capital. Thoug, a few of us would like to consider the ""London fashion and leisure show"". This is going to take place on tuesday march 14 at 10.00 to 19.00. Could you, if we may ask so, re-organise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping center. However, none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in  forecast. Perhaps, we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shop center. This is a very important stay over three days. Every one hopes to enjoying himself and comes back with a lot of knowledge. I thank you very much for hearing my request. I apologise for any inconvenience it could make. I am certain you would think over about that particular visit to ""the London fashion and leisure show"". On behalf of all the students. Yours truly.  [SEP]  What do famous people wish? Do they want to be famous and ignored? Or do they want to be persecuted buy the media? There are plenty of good things about being famous. You do not have a precarious life. You are rich and be-loved. Of course, it does not mean you deserve to be persecuted all the time. Perhaps we could call it the ""rough of the smooth"". However, to have his photos taken and showed on television and   newspapers increases your popularity. It is the way you may consider magnificent wages as it should fit your fame. I might also miss the point. You might be a Princess, a politician or a footballer; but are not doing it for any fame. You were born with the talent, sometime with the title. You never wished to be famous that much. Whateaver you do, the journalist should not follow you every second. Every one deserves to be given the right of a private life. ",27.00
115," Dear Manager, I am writing to complain about the Musical Show, I have seen last week. There is some disagreement a between your advertisement and  show, which I could see at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I would like to indicate that you put  wrong starting and finishing hours. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned. It was very surprising for me and I had got a lot of trouble with coming back home at night - when it finished. Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook at the stage. She is my famous artist and I was coming there mainly because of him. If this made me really disappointed - he wasn't playing there. Another point, I want you to consider, is  restaurant. The place you have offered was closed and there was nothing to eat inside the theatre at all. Despite changing the hours, you have closed the restaurant without any reason. Could you possibly explain why you didn't provide us  anything to eat? Finally, you have advertised, I would have  perfect evening out. Unfortunately, I can't say that. I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for giving my money back. I think, this could be the only, right possibility for me, to forget about my not interesting evening. I would appreciate it, if you could consider my complaint. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE Try to imagine: the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny large shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them. It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books. It's a REALITY, its the FASHION OF THE FUTURE... People were wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing: style, colour qual. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years. The climate is changing, so we would have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones. Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers. I hope, there will be times, when women would like to be again thought as delicate and sensible human beings. Showing their figure, they would have  possibility to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it will be  the past. Streets of  21st century will be smart. So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very poor. This fashion is coming, so think about it. Grey and black - like weather seasons, like people charakters, like all  night and dark sourranding us. These are the colours of the FUTURE. ",20.0
934," 13.06.00 Dear Mrs Ryan,  I would like to thank you for  first prize. I am really surprised that I have won. I have not expect it. I would like to send you some futher information which you need. I can only come in July because I am working in the office and I cannot take two weeks off in  other month. I am greatful that I have the chance to choose an accomodation. I would rather stay in a tent if its not  problem for you. I would like to experience a reall camp again. I used to be a scout. I need relax after  year in the office thats why I choose photography and painting which are not very active. I am  very shy person and I would prefer to stay in a small group of people, if its possible. I have to questions. I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I should take and I would like to know your opinion  how much money I should take. I would like to thank you onc again for this great opportiunity. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Apolonia Gorski  [SEP]  We would like to belive that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life. After working all week, finally on Saturday we can do shopping. We love spending money, but spending money is not always enjoyable. Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go confortable because of  crowd. Why its always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundrets other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods. ",29.0
1008," Dear Pete, Many thanks for your letter which arrived must when I was thinking of you. I hope you and your family are feeling well. I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday. The only problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation. As you know I'm in Ferndown now spending  last minutes studying for exams. I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you. If not, pleas let me know. I'm sure we will find another solution. It's very kind of you to let me use things in your flat. I'm over the moon! Can I also ""take care"" of your computer and CD player and bicycle? Can you also let me know when you are going to come back on the 20th. Will it be or dinner time maybe? If yes, great! I will be able to see you. You know that helping you it's a real pleasure for me, you really don't have to become flat broke because of buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So  tiny ""Statue of Liberty"" will be nice. I will finish now as I have  mountain of work to do. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Take Care Yours,  [SEP]  ""junk food instead of a carrot"" Young man, are you aware of what you eat and drink? Are you sure that your diet is healthy enough to help you grow up? In today's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home, especially children, parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper. However, students who never have time for  healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or fibre usually finish on ""McDonalds"", hamburgers or Bic Macs. Moreover, very often  school canteen doesn't offer diversified  food like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal  and even if the times were worse, people were more sensible. In my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as they should work on their lifestyles and keep their head. ",34.00
430," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writting to you about the show. I was very disappointed after this show. I would like to have my money back. At first the show started at 10.15, and it should be at 19.30. After your show I wanted to visit my friends, and because of it, I didn't do it. Also, you wrote about discounts, but it's not true! The woman, who sold  a ticket was very roud with me, actually she started swearing at me. During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit  restaurant, it's a pity, but  restaurant was closed because it was too late. And, I forget to say  about  actor, I didn't enjoy them. So, I hope I will get my money back, it was  very disappointing evening out in my life! I hope you understand me! your sincerely Ongelina  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but any way I trusted him. It's happened 3 months ago, and during this  months I am very upset. I have a friend, his name  Peter, he is my best friend. One day Peter killed one boy. They were just playing and be acsident, Peter shoot him. I was there, I saw it. I hoped that it, just could see  3 people, but it was  mistake... Pat saw it! We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret, not to tell anyone. We trusted him. At first several days, Pat all the time was with us. He promised to keep  secret, in the next morning we had  arguiment with Pat,  3 of us were shouting at each other, in shorter Pat went away from us. Two days later in the morning, the policeman came to  Peter... So, now my best friend is  prisoner. All the time I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in the prison  5 years. By the way I don't see Pat  about one year. Perhaps, he moved into another town. It's good that he  far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny... ",9
569," 13th June 2000 Dear Sir, I have just receised your letter and I thanck you for your invitation and congratulations. I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction for your perfect organisation. About the information requested from me I have to say that I can travel only  July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June. As regards accomodation, I prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting. My favourite sports-activities are playing tennis and basketball. I like competitive and changelling sports, I enjoy myself comparing my skill with other players and, if possible, I  rather practising sports-activities not indoor, but open air . I would like to know if special clothes are needed and how the weather is in this period like. The one last thing that I would like to know is if I have to bring with me money for expenses not included in your invitation. Let me know this information as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Ramona  [SEP]   13 June 2000 I have been asked to write a report about the lessons and other activities that should be filmed to make a short video. I have given a questionnaire to other students of my class to know their preferences about this choise and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is Philosophy. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good in explaing problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the sports-activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the atletics-school games. Also the dancing lessons should be filmed, specially for the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their moviments. I hope that these my suggestions can be accepted and appreciated.

492," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice. The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show. The things that really dissapointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were suposed to be the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the hole show very bad. Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but finally it started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of others people time. Another thing was that you said discounts are available which is very important for students, but no their weren't any. Also after the show your restaurant was closed because their wasn't enough staff. To be honest that was not a great expierence and I hope you will see my point. In that case I also want to ask you for my money back. I think you will understand that and   looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully T. Herschel  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly. We can't imagine to live without it anymore because we are so dependent of it. It starts already in the morning that we wake up by the sound of an alarm clock, than in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the hole house is warm due to central heating. Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat. If we than want to go to work we don't have to get our horse, no, we get the car keys and go where ever we want to. At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology, the computer. Without that we can't do anything today. So in the last century our daily life changed dramandesly and we became lazy and our life unpersonal, fast and unromantic. Noone can think about a life without commuters or electricity. But we can't say the new technology has done just bad things in our life because otherwise we couldn't have made such progress in all the sciences and other subjects ",31.0
394," Dear Sir/Madam I am writting to complain about what it says in the advertisement is not true. I was really disappointed. Here are the following points, which I do not think that you have realised what you have put down. 1 The advertisement says the show starts at 19:30. Unfortunately it started at 20:15. And I think I could find something  worth to do than just writing, doing nothing during this spare time. 2 I was expected that there would be discount available for people who have student card as it says in the notice, but there was not. 3 You recommend that there will be the resturant after the show. However all I can see, the light was off and the door was locked. This is because they are rebuilding it again. 4 I have also thought in the show there was no different actor. 5 Never the less, I took my headmistress with me and I have recommened how wonderful this show was going to be. It would be greatful if you consider to return my money for the tickets back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully. Sapawadee Prisuntha.

The first thing for fashion what is called ""clothing"" or what they wear.  1st ""F"" is from ""fast-food"", something fast and easy to be spotted, which is  ancient wearing style. This is not nomally what people wear everyday.  2nd F is 'fulfill' wear ever you have under your mom's cupboard. For example long baggy troossers, which cover your bright brick shoes. Wherever you go every one would love you because of your troussers,  would clean  all the rubbish that are on the road.  3rd ""F"" could not be anything else apart from something that could make you look ""fool"". Having holes all around your body (including unsuitable place), which could make you look like an animal such as having a big metal ring in your nose etc. If it is not these 3F booming in 100 years from now, so what else could you think of?

1106," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to   your advertisement about the ""London Fashion"" and ""Leisure Show"". Thank you for organising this good programme, especially the Leisure show, which  very interest  us. So all of our class would like to go to the show during the three days in London. But there is a problem which I hope you can solve. According to your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which included in sightseeing by bus,  River trip to Greenwich,  Science Museum and National Art Gallery  so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. From these we can see the latest fashion, imagintive make up and hairstyles. What is more they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it. In your advertisement, you had written ""The show will be help in  Central Exhibition hall in London, it starts from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March. I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves. But I wonder if the timetable could change, which will be perfect. As you know, all of us want to join the programme, so if some students go to  Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show. For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities. In my opinion, we had better go to  show instead of  science museum and shopping, also we can go to  Science Museum on 15th March, which instead of the free time in the afternoon. I am sorry to make your inconveint. I hope it doesn't make some trouble if you accept my suggestion. I look forward to receiving your apply as soon as possible. your sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Because..... Last night, when I went into my house it was quite scilence. I felt there might be something  has gone wrong. I found my parents sitting in a armchair. I could see sadness in my father's eyes. My mother came over to me and said softly, ; my dear, your father's company has jut gone bankrupt', then she couldn't help crying. When I hear this bad news, I was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company. My father always remembered his responsibily was giving  good salary to his worker, which is the view of his life. So I must find out a solution which can help my great father. One day, I suddenly got a good idea. 'Why not go to  sock exchange?' I said to myself. Almost every day I stayed in there and research the exchange decline-line, which give me lots of information from there. Finally, I decide to join  the dangerous game, which will lost everything or suddenly become  millionaire. With luck, I was won by chance. When I with mixed mood went home I found my parents were stooding at the door looked like very cheerful. 'Surely it doesn't mean that they have learnt the exciting news?' I said to myself again. Much to my surprise, they told me in high voice that they never went bankrupt, they wanted to give me a opportunity to do something impressive by myself. Now, they are both prouding of me! ",17.00

About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming, not because I am good in it, just because I  keen on  and the other one is Photography.

The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for  throat. Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels, I mean, dried towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh; don't ask me why. The pop concert happened in a big stadium called ""Mararcanã"". I just did not enjoyed  when they were making the instruments work for the big day.

9," Dear Mrs Clark, I am writing to you to give some opinion about the International Arts Festival that you have organized last November. First of all, I believe that it was very interesting, but there were few artists than I have expected. In fact they came from six countries. I wonder if it is possible for next year to have more artists and also bigger concert halls. In fact I have noticed that some concert need to more space. I would be grateful if, next year, you could put more art exhibitions (with more pictures) in the program. I was very interested in the ticket of Festival. It was not expensive and  easy to use, because it was only one for all the events. I would offer you one suggestion that concers the classical concerts. I think it would be interesting to invite young compositors to hear news from the classical music. I look forward to receiving your reply Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Dear Magda, how are you? Well, I hope. I'm O.K. I've just received your letter and I'm going to reply to your questions. In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools. For example, we have to wear in  appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers. At this time, in my school there is a new rule. We aren't allowed to use the mobile phone in class. Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster. And now about my home. I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time in which my family can eat together. For me, it's very stressfull and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like cheat with my class mates after our lessons. I'd like to change a rule at home. I'm not allowed to listen to music after 11 p.m. It's a boring rule. Neighbours have complained about loud music. Write to me soon about news in your life. Love ",23.00

It was a wonderful chance for me. As you know, I love music. Before the concert started, I cleaned the stage for  singers and I gave some drinks to  singers. Finally, I cleaned the stage again. My works were for  singers, so I could meet singers and talk together. Do you know ""Radio Head""? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some signatures of them. It's brilliant, isn't it? Especially, I liked cleaning the stage, because I could stand  a famouse singer's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm, even though I had to clean it.

[SEP]  The car: I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries. Nowadays more than the percents of the world industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, gasoline extracting and refining, tyres recycling, and so on. The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone. At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was  kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed according to this social evolution. The increasing number of cars related and infrastructure are now creeting problems. A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries. People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility. This will be a tough challenge for this new century. ",29.00

The reason I'm writting this letter for you is that in my staying in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre. When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone  actually didn't appear, I noticed there in the show,  someone completely different of him so I felt bad. Moreover, this complaining is not only about the actor, who ever , the problem is that the show started too late. I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began only  20:15.  I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't have any discounts as it was written on the folder. After the show I wanted some thing on the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed. After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad. I think I can forgive your theatre, only if you give me a refund of the money I spent there, and some other more for all the problems I had. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology nowadays is something everybody has on your own mind. Every person in the world looks for technology everyday to improve the way they live their own life. We young people don't remember when technology wasn't part of our daily life, but our parents, or grand parents remember  exactly  when they were young, and everything was made in a different way, for example our parents didn't have computers at home when they were teenagers. Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer at your house, and when you have to do a homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to the school, also you can search for new subjects on the internet. Finally, technology is a word that  will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how technology, and in which speed it will develop to the future. Maybe, technology will never stop growing and our life will never work without computers. ",24.0

He had a puncture wheel and he didn't know how to repeared  then I chanced the wheel and during this time he was asking me for my hobbies, studies, everything.

All right that's about all my news, then writte soon and tell me about you. Lots of love ",11.0

408," lausanne, the 17th of June 2000 Dear Sir, Last weekend, I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show ""over the Rainbow"". I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in  theatre. On the paper it was writting  the principal actor is ""Danny Brook"" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor that we have never seen, and heard. I think it's really not correct. They haven't respect the timetable, the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault?! But it's not finish you wrote on the paper ""Discounts available"" but it wasn't true, it was a very badly organisation. After this bad show we had want to go to the Restaurant for  drunk and ate something and it was closed and nobody had explained  us why the Restaurant wasn't open. So, I'm very angry when I think about this evening, and I want to have my money back. I think it's the minimum you have to do for me. Thank you in advance.  [SEP]  SCHOOLS ENGLISH LANGUAGE MAGAZINE Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this sentance is very popular in our school. Pat is not an angry girl. She is very friendly but she can't keep a secret. Last year, on a Saturday evening my boyfriend phone me at 20 h o'clock and said  me, ""Would you like to go to the cinema with me"" I asked my parents but the said  me ""No you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school. Then I phone to Pat for explain my big problem. Pat said to me ""You said to your parents that you  sleep by me and you don't go to the cinema. I asked my parents and they said alright you can go to Pat for sleeping. I was very happy, I phone to my boyfriend and I explained him my secret he said allright so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema"". I passed a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phone Pat's mother and Pat's mother explain all the story to my mother. If Pat haden't say the secret to her mother I would be  have no  problem. Since this Saturday evening I had never speaking with Pat. ",24.0
450," To the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager: Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your show ""Over the rainbow"" and the conditions in which it is held. I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show. I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor. So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available  as  stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15! No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted. To sum up, it was not the ""perfect evening out!"" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead). Looking forward to receiving your reply very soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's what I learned from my own experience. We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets for each other. At that time, I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money. I had to wait ten days before the lotery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone. But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I find out that I had many unsuspected friends... No longer after, they were asking me to pay a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go shopping, others to go to the cinema and the restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me. Endly came the end of the week and I went to the lotery office to check the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs for many people had found five numbers like me. SO I told my friend Pat how much I had won and the following day at school, everybody were just the same as they ever were with me... ",34.0
77," Dear Ms Clark, I am very glad to write to you. I spent two days at the International Arts festival you organised. I enjoyed most of the events I went to, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. Here are some opinions and suggestions: Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries. Additionally, some concert halls were too small to relax , while most of them were very comfortable. It was a pity for me that there were fewer plays and films than I had expected. I suggest to you that you should organise more next year. On the other hand, there were a lot that impressed me very much. For example, there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. It is a very good way to increase the number of music-lovers. Last but not last, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year. I enjoyed it very much. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Long long ago, there lived in a province of Bizen in Japan an old woman and an old man. They were eagar to have a child, but they had never been able to. One day, the woman went to the riverside, and found a peach floating in the river. She brought it to her house, cutting it  with her husband. To their surprise, there was a boy in the peach! They named him Momotaro, and looked after him. The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures. He made up his mind to defeat them, and asked his stepmother for some kibidango, one of traditional snacks in Japan. Having eaten the kibidango, he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him: a dog, a monkey and a bird. Reaching the island, he and his friends fought bravely against the devils. They finally succeeded n defeating the devils, and took back all the money and treasures. After that, they went home. All the people in Bizen including his stepparents met Momotaro and his friends with a great joy. This story happened a long time ago. ",31.00
276," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing this letter to you to show the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and the real life. When I saw your advertisement on yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you have written on your advertisement. But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time. I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose seeing Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage. Moreover it was written  that the musical was between 14:30-19:30. Suprisingly the show started at 20:15. That destroyed all my plans. Then I decided to have a dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed. I think, all of these disappointments are too much for one evening. After all I am sure that you understood it wasn't my perfect evening out and you will give  my money back. I am looking forward to hearing your good news  Sincerely,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That was also my fault. I don't know why I told this to Pat. But I thought Pat and I were best friends. Yesterday Larry suggested going to  cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to  cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted immidiately. I was like walking on the clouds  the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I promised Pat to help her with her history homework. She came near to me and said ""Ready for this evening? Don't forget bringing your history books."" She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I want to tell her something. Then I explained what has happened that morning. She was about to cry. ""I see. You choose Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend."" After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell this anyone. She said OK angrily. After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told  that I promised my Mom to be with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my bedroom's door I burst into tears. I don't know how long I cried... Next morning I went to school again. Everyone at the school was knowing about my love to Larry including him. Pat was the only person who knew  it. That showed me not to trust anyone. ",24.0
373," Circle theatre's Manager: I am writting  you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". There were many things that were wrong in the advertisement I saw. First the actors who were suppoused to star in this show were not the ones put in there. So when I saw the show I felt horrible, because I was expecting to see Danny Brook. But the problems started while I arrived  the place. I had a discount for it, but they refussed it and I had to pay the full price. Appart from this, the show started fourty five minutes later. I think this reasons are suficiently enough to ask for my money back. So I hope that you will understand my point. Please be comprehensive and realize that your show was not cheap. I'm a student, so I do not have a lot of money and I need it back. I also had to tell you that the theatre restaurant was closed because there were  few people there and they take me out of the place, so I was very upset. I will go to your office this week. I hope to see you there.  [SEP]  Pat's secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about the relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John, loved each other so much that it wouldn't be rare to find that they had have sex together. The point here is, that Caroline choosed the worst friend to told this . She was also concerned about being pregned, but she was afraid to told John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat react in a very wrong way and told rapidly to John. He couldn't belived what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay  a very expensive operation. But as every story this has a happy final. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her fantasy. And Pat understood that secrets should die on your own. ",26.0
743," Dear Sir/Madame, I'm writeng with reference to your letter. I've being very thrilled, when I've known, that I won first prize in your competition. I always dreamed about going to the California and now my dreams are coming truth. If it's possible, I would like to travel only  July, because my school won't be finished earlier. I couldn't go  August, either, because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends. If I had a choice, I would prefer to live in  tent then in a log cabin. I can't imagine real holidays without a tent. It's one of the most important things for me, to have a chance to forget about all my present, luxurious life and try doing something different. I would be very grateful, if you gave me a possibility of singing. I've always wanted to learn singing professionaly, but I've never had an occasion. I'm very keen on swimming, too. Normally, I live in the seaside and I couldn't live without this sport. Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters. distance. I would like to ask you what clothes should I take with me? My mother told me, that when she had been there two years ago it was really hot. Should I take with me a lot of money? You know, I'm only a student. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely Halina Lipnicka  [SEP]  Hallo, Kim! Thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't rewritten sooner, but I was very busy. I must tell you that helping at pop concerts is very exciting, but very tiring too, so I had to rest. You asked me about my experiences. Well, it was the best time of my life! I worked all days, but I did it with pleasure. We lived here in rush, but there was a lot of fun, too. I was very surprised, when I saw that singers aren't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are written in the newspapers. One day I was talking to Stenkovska, because I had to go to buy something to eat for everyone, so I should ask her what did she want. When she tried to answear me, one small child made her a picture with  flesh. Imagine, she weren't angry! She said he should do it again, because she had stupid features! If I were she, I would kill that boy, but she was nice! Trully, my work here wasn't very important, but I relly enjoyed it. I've met here so many new people! Sometimes somebody should on me, but I have to say they are often right. Well, I made  couple  mistakes. The hardest was, when I brought a pepperoni pizza for kubulska, but she doesn't eat meat! But, for luck, it wasn't achieved with succes of our concert. You have to admit, that the show was magnificent. I hope you had a great fun when you was watching us at the TV set, didn't you? O.K. That's all for today. I'll write  you again tomorrow, because now my Mom is angry, the I'am not sleeping yet. Write soon! I can't hardly wait. Give my best to your parents. Hugs and kisses Halina.

489," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you about the differences between the advertisment and the real show. I am also expecting to get some money back. First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason of the delay and excuse about it. If there was someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something. Then, as we were told that the show was begginning, the second shock of the evening faced us. Instead of the famous actor Danny Brook, a very bad and disappointing actor showed up. Watching the show plus the 45 minutes of delay made us hungry of course so we decided to eat at the theatre restaurant. As it was too late, the restaurant was closed and we starved till we got to our homes. We were also disappointed because there were no discounts! (As I mentioned above) I was very disappointed and I am asking for some money back if possible.  [SEP]  PAT AND SECRETS .... Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Knowing that he decided to not to see Alison until the birthday party. Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles. The best bakery was at the other side of the town so there was no danger for him to see Alison and reveal the party. He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery. On his way he saw lots of places he could buy the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which is as  andy as Alison's house he kept on riding. When he reached the bakery, he was quite relieved and he almost forgot that he had a secret to keep.  Picking the best cake he was preparing to go back. He suddenly saw Alison and said ""Did you like the cake, it's for your birthday party"". After the conversation was over Pat still wasn't aware of what he had done, and he didn't find out till the party took place. ",32.0
157," To. Mr or Mrs Manager of Circle Theatre. Hi. My name is Taeron Jon. And I would like to inform you that something is not right and  unfair about your theatre. I recently had a week's holiday in London. During I stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunatly I had a very disappointing evening. The advertisement that you distributed through all the magazines wee totally untrue. Which so called ""Rip off"". First of all you said Danny Brook is in the play but  different actor was in the roll. It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason I mean  main reason which made me to go was to see Danny Brook. Secondly about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to  late start it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait out side for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing out side and I got  horrible cold for that. lastly about the ticket  advertisment saids 'Discouts Available' but no way I had to pad  full £ 20.00 and  restaurant was closed because of rebuilding  something. How ever the point that it am trying to say is  you just ruined my hoilday. For me, It's not easy to have  holiday and your play just blew my precious time away. Let me make it clear, you blew my time and money. I don't thing your play worth £ 20.00. Your advertisment was un fair. As you are a manager, you have resposbillity  to justify this problem. and I have  right to get a fair treatment as a costomer. So therefore I would like you to pay some money back. I am not asking for full payment but minimum 50%  that it paid for nothing but the disappoint. Thank you. Yours Taeron Jon  [SEP]  Fashion of the future. Fashion, what is fashion? Popular design of cloths. In  particular time? Maybe. But I say fashion is Artistic insperation which  expressed by fabric and all sort of material. In some way, fashion is combined with science as well. Now a days fashion play  big roll in our daily life. Million kinds of fashion magazines and News paper tells you how much people are interested in fashion. What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuffs. As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and insperations that we get from all sort of enviroment. Development of science produce new materials like water proof or fire proof fabrics. For example Castum of Astronuts. These days we are very intrested in space and  millenium and things and many designers  showed millenium looks recently. But we don't wear them. Frankly we can't because we think it's too odd or strange. But what about 100 year later? I expect human being'll live in the other planets and trevel around under  sea. I think people'll wear those spacy and Ciber looking cloth after a centry. What do you think? Can you imagin you and your friends going   picnic to the Moon with  silvery skirt with Astronut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots? It could be more facinating. Endless imagination and development of technology will lead us to future fashion. ",22.0
194," DEAR SIR, I AM WRITTING IN ORDER TO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE OFFER. I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME, UNFORTUNETELY, THINGS WERE VERY WRONG. FIRSTLY, IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK, AND THAT WAS FALSE BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR. THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. SECONDLY, THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGH, THAT IS FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE. LASTLY, AFTER THAT AWFULL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, OF COURSE, I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE.

SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS, SO MY QUALIFICATIONS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD. I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD. AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CONCERT OF CHARLY GARCIA. THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWIN FRIDAY, WICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS.

I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it, we were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, the last day was the worst thing we have got, which was your musical show. At first, you said that, if we had bought 5 tickets, we would have had a discount, but we didn't have anything. Secondly, we booked  the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15, what's wrong with your clock?. Thirdly, someone on stage was very strenge for me, because I expected to see ""Danny Brook"", but I didn't. The last one, we wanted to have a dinner in your restaurant after a terrible musical show, but we couldn't have it, because a waiter said your chef had gone home. I have no idea what your business is, I have never seen something like this. By the way, I want you to pay  my money back for the waste time, and I think that you understand. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Have you ever been in the Countryside? Try it, it doesn't need to take a long time to live in that place, but it will give you many things, which are different from your lifestyle in  city. Nowadays you wake up in a morning, go to school or work by the sky-train, start your lessons with the computer, go for shopping in a store which has an air-conditioner, watch cartoons on TV, or cook by a microwave oven etc. Do you really enjoy it? Althoug the modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it gives you natural, peace and fresh air? How much the technology gives to you, it take from you more. Have you heard about the environment pollutions, the healthy problems and the moral problems?

232," To: the manager of The Circle Theatre From: Subject: complaint Dear Sir or Madam, I was at the show of your theatre three days ago. Unfortunately, my expectations have not been realized because of  many problems I had during the show. First of all, there was another actor instead of Danny Brook (as it was written in the advertisement). Secondly, the show was delayed and started at 20.15 so I had to wait 45 minutes doing absolutely nothing and wasting my time. No discounts were given and, what is more, your theatre restaurant was closed all the time. I was not able to have a dinner after the show. On the whole, I was very disappointed  having left the Circle Theatre. All the impressions were destroyed by many problems. I ask you for returning my money back. Or I will have nothing to do except for going to the court. Faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Three hundred years ago fashion changed up one time in each hundred years. One hundred years ago it was one time in 50-25 years. And now we have to change some of our clothes every 6 months because they are not so fashionable any more. Fashion is one of the most important parts of our image and everyday life now. Fashion is becoming more useful, all the new inventions and technologies are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future. It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now. With no doubt, the influence of modern technologies will be great. Future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable, we can see the progress in the fashion even now. It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year of 2050. So all the fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable. What will we have? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning. ",27.0
617," Dear Mrs Ryan It was a grate pleasure to hearing from you, that I have won first prize in your competition. I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but even though I would like to know how much money do I have to take with me. I would be glad to travel only in July because of family reasons. Other point is accommodation. I would be more than happy if you could have provided me with  tent. The reasons as following;  better relationship with nature, and  grate opportunity to improve my health. Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to chose and why. I like swimming and photography because it will be very interesting to improve my skills at both activities. The last thing I would like to know is which clothes do I have to take, even though the weathe in July will be good. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but a few of us who is very happy to spend money. Money is a very important thing in shopping, if you have money,  is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagen that your credit card is not working, or some one stold your cash from your pocket. We will say  unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapt. Staying in a que or croude is also unplesent. All  people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need. After words you are tiered and have no power to do things. After all  things that I have mentioned it is clearly seen that shopping is not enjoyable. ",24.0
69," Dear Miss Clark, I have recently taken part in your International Arts Festival. I enjoyied it and here are some feelings and advice for next year. First of all, it was a great idea to put together different countries to organise this Festival. However, there were only artists from six countries, not  as written in your add. Then I had  pleasure  listening to your variety of concerts. Each one was fantastic and fill in with euration, but I'd appreciate more place, because unfortunately some concert halls were too small! You certainly saw that  plays and films had a lot of success. So, I wanted to know if there will be more films next year. It could be an advantage! An other excellent thing was your choice for the entry. That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events. That was simpler than an other way of selling tickets (practical and attractive). Finally, I want you to make a suggestion for next year. It would be better if people have had the possibility to let their cars very near to the Festival during the week-end! I am sure you'll pay attention to my suggestions and advice and I am looking forward to seeing you next year. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps. So, her father prepared the car and her mother took some food for the journey. That was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited. He was very keen on going in the mountains. Suddenly, the father stopped and said: ""Here we are!"" They were near a little house, built in wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family. They ate with the owner of the little house, whose name was John. It was very quiet because they were in  nature; they could just hear  cows and John's two dogs. Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects in wood. After that, marks father who had fluent traditional Swiss language spent time with an old woman he had just met near the house. After eating old cheese and Swiss chocolate, that was high time Mark's family went back home. Mark was such happy but very exhausted to recognize this story nevertheless this story happened a long time ago. ",27.00
514," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing with reference to a musical show I saw recently in your theatre. The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star Danny Brook, but there was an other actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook In addition, the performance started 45 minutes later, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it had been closed already. More over, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and me are both on  pension. As a result our evening was completely spoiled. So I am sure you will understand why I  so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partly refund. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce, Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it  herself. Her father had met another woman who had not been as pretty as Maria's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary. One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter. All  fathers things were missing. They could not believ their eyes. They read the letter and slowly went onto the kitchen. Maria bought his favorite food and she throw it away into the bin. How he could have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years. They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot. Now everything was over. She went to skool, but she could not pick the material up as easy as she used to. So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat. She was so understanding. Now everyone knows about her sad story  that makes her feel even more worse. ",30.0
191," Dear manager, I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show was with wrong information. Firstly, the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement which was very disappointing for me. Furthermore, according to the advertisement I was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15. Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts  available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price written in the advertisement. When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant I could not get in because it was closed as the chef of the restaurant was not there. I did not have a perfect evening out and I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Technology has changed our life forever. Nowadays life is much easier than in the old days. Firstly, we can cook our meals  an electrical stove or in a microwave and it takes just a few minutes to get ready. We do not need to lit  fire in order to cook as in the old days. Secondly, the doctors have found the cure for many diseases and many operations have been done in less time and in a painless way, by using especial machines doctors have be able to save more lives than in the past. For those who need to travel in order to make business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive in their destination safely or have their problems solved through telephone. To sum up, technology has been a great help to all of us. In the future, it will be able to help people even more since it has been increasing its capacity day after day. ",30.0
750," Dear Helen Ryan, I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month. First of all, I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school's activities so my parents just let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes. About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been practicing it during 5 years so I want to keep on it. The other activity that I chose is painting, I am not as well as I want, nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course. I would rather   tends than  log cabins for  accommodation because the last summer I had the great opportunity to be in a log cabin and now I want to know  the other one . I am sure it will be thrilling to stay near the nature and at the same time, it would be a new experience for me. I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me  appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know, is the amount of money that I have to bring with me. If you need more information, please do not hesitate on writing  me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  To: John Weller. From: Raquel Rossell. Re: Suggestions for the film. Introduction To make easier and faster this report , it was necessary to make a questionarie which was gave out in the school. After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results: 1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the listening room room and the library because as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places  helping them to improve their English on their own. 2 - They also think, that  filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes. 3 - The least but not the last, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activities organised by the social programme, has became really exciting, so they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those that did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying  and they mentioned it as not really important. Conclusion As you can see, my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have. Despite of being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar. I do recommend to pay attention to the food in the cafeteria because even though it was not the main reason of this report, they also wrote complaning about that. If you need more information and the sheets that I collected, please do not hesitate on asking me for them. ",29.0
916," June 13th, 2000 Dear Mrs. Ryan, I am writing concerning the journey I have won in your competition. First of all I will try to answer your questions. For me it is only possible to go to the USA in July. The reason for this is that I have to work in August and from September to June I have to go to school. I would prefer  long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me. The activities you offer are really interesting. I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera. Unfortunately, I do not have an own camera. In spite of this, I have got all  equipement I need for the activity painting and I am painting very well. Could you please tell me if I will need some extra money for the two activities. Secondly, I want to know if I should take any warm clothes with me. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, It was nice to hear from you recently. I am writing to tell you about my work at the pop concert. I went there a 10 o'clock in the morning. Then a young man told me what to do. First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position. It was really hard work. At one o'clock I had a break. At this time I promised  that I would never do this awful job again. The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it. In the afternoon I was sitting around, waiting for the pop groups. Then at five o'clock my favourite band ""Tristania"" arrived. I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later. In the end I was happy that I had done this job. It was really a wonderful day. I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together the next year. Give my regards to your family.

752," Dear Madam Ryan, I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. It is a wonderful surprise. I can go to the Camp California only in July, because I have school in June and I must work in my father's bookshop in August. At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience in this sport, because I played tennis during seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted. I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take (if it is going to  rainy or to be sunny) and how much money I must have with me. Could you tell me what sort of material I will have to bring to do the activities? Yours sincerely Odette Douai Luna  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Do you know last week I have been to a pop concert to help my uncle, who is the director of the stadium of Lugano. It was very interresting, because I did different things. I cooked a meal for the artists, I spoke with the manager of Bruce Springsteen and I helped a technician to install his material: the lights. The best part of the day was after the concert, when I met the group ""U2"". I was very excited, because this is my favourite group: I'm always hearing  their songs. I took some photographies and I'll show them to you when you come next week I had a talk with Santana, the best guitarist in the world, too. He's quite old, but very attractive. I would like playing guitar like him. What a great day it was. The next concert is on 19th June and I will be here. See you soon. Yours Odette ",32.0
261," Dear Mr. Brown, My name is Anne Singler and I have already watched the musical ""Over the rainbow"" in the Circle Theatre. I'm writing to you because I wasn't pleased with the show! In your advert for the musical show you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't. First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a smaller pice than £20 for my six year old daughter. Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show. For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook. After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening. So I want to ask you for giving me my money back because I think I  have better  spent my money on anything else. I hope you understand my point of view and write back. Yours,  [SEP]  The secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day her best friend Sally told her that she had betrayed her boyfriend. Pat was really shocked to hear this but she had to promise Sally to keep quiet. Pat really liked chatting about others and so she wasn't able to keep quiet about Sally's secret. She told it to her boyfriend Paul. After that Paul got white in his face, he was pale like a wall and it seemed as he would be very nervous. Pat couldn't understand Paul's reaction and so she didn't care about it. Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally, which just came out of Paul's house. Now Pat realized what was going on and could undstand why her boyfriend got so nervous about the secret. He was Sally's lover! In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets! ",29.0
571," Dear Miss Helen Ryan I am writing in reply to your letter. I am absolutely delighted with the news. It really took me by surprise this prize, I didn't think I would be so lucky  to win. First of all, about your enquires, the only time suitable for me to travel is in July. The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here. Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, there's no further reason is just that  would be a new experience for me and I'm very excited about it. I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities during the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love sea-sports and their chalenges. Finally I'd like to ask you some questions, there are mainly  small details. I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes, if not what sort of clothes I should bring, and also how much money roughly I will need for my daily expenses. I would be very grateful for your help and advice in this matters. Thanks for the wonderful news. I'm looking forward to it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim My dear friend I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am. You must remember me telling you about the pop concert, well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it. The concert was a huge success, lots of people came and enjoyed the music. I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially when the musicians arrived, they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get. My tasks were very especifics. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and weir and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage. I really enjoyed working with those people, they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes. However, what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing, jumping and enjoying frenetically of something that I had been part of and helped to make it happened. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best Wishes ",35.0
275," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir, Last week, I was on holiday in London, and reading the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (like it is said) ""a perfect evening out"". But  it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct at all, or I must have been to the wrong show! According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing! The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing. I was a little hungry after the show, but then again, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information . In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.. But I found out afterwards and it was too late. Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with her: she could do anything to have friends, even betray me. No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. ""He's travelling around the world"" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But  know Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man. Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same. Everyone, even my friends, looked at me in a strange kind of way. As if I was guilty. What did I have to do with this? I wasn't the one who had killed the man, but it seemed people didn't want to talk to me anymore. I knew, now, why I wanted to hide the truth. ",32.0

Second of all, About the accomodation, I would prefer a log cabin, I think that will be more safety about all my stuff. I'm very keen to have the chance to do some activities, I'm very attracted by the golf. I will be a beginner because I've never done this sport before but I will have a try. Also, I choose surfing, I love this sport. I've been practicing this sport since 5 years, so I'm quiet good.

All right, I wasn't able to do all the stuff like the lights the stereo, the sound but I've been helping to built the stage and the installation of micros. The stage was gigantesque the crowed could be all around. I really enjoyed to be next to the pop stars I got a lot of autographes, that was the first time I've seen  like Jagger a lot of well know pop stars was there. I mean It's still inbelivable, can you imagine that was  like a dream I was  checking their hands. I keep a very good souvenir about this experience. I think I will go back the next year.

I'd like to tell you that the best month  to travel to the U.S.A is on july because I will be on hollidays in this month. I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can tell you wich one I prefer I'll choose  in  tent. This is because  is more exciting and fun than not in log cabins. From the list of activities to do at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming. I used to go to a swimming pool twice every week and also I love music and sing all the time.

It was great, believe me! I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy, a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the Club and we put it on the stage. After this, we helped to the service bar to put into the fridges all  drinks and refreshments. And that was it! I enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marevellous! Well Kim, I hope to see you soon and take care. Love ",29.0
763," Dear Sir & Madam Thank you for your letter. I'm writing this letter to tell you some further information that you need. First of all, I'd like to travel in July because I have to work  except that month. July is the only month that I can be free. I prefer staying in tents because it is  unusual experience for me. Also I'd like to have the chance to play tennis and  sailing at the camp. Talking about tennis, I used to play it for about five years when I was a child. I think I'm much better than a beginner. But I never had a chance to enjoy sailing. I'd like to try this time. Now, I have two questions about camping. First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough? I've never been to California, therefore please let me know about the weather there. Second, how much money to I need? I haven't a clue about it. I'd like to know some examples. I'm waiting for your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim It was so nice to hear from you last time. Thank you very much. As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, the artist's name was ""Bonny Pink"" who is famous in my country. I could enjoy her music very much. My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was  most exciting job. Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite artist and her hobby. I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing puzzle alone. She seemed to be  very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had  very gentle attitude when she spoke to me. I became a fan of her. It was  very interesting experience for me. I wish you were there. But don't worry Kim, I'll send you a copy of her CD for you. I hope you can enjoy . Anyway it's the time to go to bed. Take care of yourself, Kim. I'm waiting for your letter.

1203," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about  international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here. The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed. The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite to the hotel) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it. There is a party on the last day of the conference. Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best. Less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music, dancing and fun are provided. Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11pm. You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party. Coming back to ideas and Suggestions I'v promised to give you about  free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to  for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such a simple and usuall things like a telefone, a car, a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us (or we have got used) as we use them every day. Hundred years before people couldn't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer. They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so. Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them. First of all they say about  enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others . But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then. I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone  doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention  hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life. Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an automobile transport is  undenyable neccecerity in our life. In case of all  said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel's inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages. ",24.00

Last week during my holiday in London, I found your advertisment in my newspaper. This looked very good to me, one of my favourite actors, the time did suit me and  for the tickets was a discount available. Everything was just perfect. But, suddenly the whole evening changed into something, we didn't expected at all. The first disappointment confronted us on the main entrance, there was no discount for our ticket available. Despite of this we have still been looking forward to the show and Danny Brook. Your state in your advertisment that he would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up. Actually, this guy was not half as good as Danny Brook. The other thing was the time, the show was supposed to start at half past seven, but we have been waiting for 45 minutes, before the light turned off. Till then we have been very upset about the evening and decided to go for dinner. Eventually, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I really do regret that I told Pat about my feelings for the new girl in class, but who else can I talk to, if it is not your best friend?. Her name is Carla and she just changed school, she is so beautiful, with long legs, blond hair and a voice which makes me melt. I've never been so fascinated by a girl and so I knew it must have been real love. Luckely I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then, it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to. Pat, he was my friend, and he knew girls. I thought he would keep everything like a thing between him and me, but he disappointed me. He actually went to Carla and told her every thing. No doubt she would never ever look at me again. But she did, she asked me out. The horrible thing about this is, I'm still in heaven, but  out with the wrong person, because Pat mixed the persons with their names. There are two Carlas in my class! ",23.0
1098," Dear Mister Robertson Thank you very much for organising the programme of our three days visit to London. The programme looks very good, especially the river trip to Greenwich. Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme of our trip. We have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" and we would all like to go to the show. We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest to replace the shopping part on Tuesday afternoon by the visit of the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometimes later. Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change of the programme. We are sure this is suitable to all of us. Thank you very much. Best regards  [SEP]  The home of the future The view from outside will mainly be the same. The houses will look like the houses  today. A simple and well-proofen architecture. The difference will be inside the buildings. The doors would be the entrance to another world.... The fridge, the television, the stove and the Hi-Fi equipment will be attached to a computer network. Every electronic gadget in the futur home will be able to comunicate with other machines or computers. It will be possible to connect to the Internet from nearly everywhere in the house or flat. I'm sure all the things which are based on electronic parts will totally change. Also the aspects of security within people's homes. But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes. All the big and small things which are defining people's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture, the pictures on the wall....

I was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details. I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and is the most convenient time for me. At Camp California, I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable. The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing. I think they are a good contrast. I have not done sailing for quite a long time so I might find it difficult but I am looking forward to it. As well as a good exercise, I would also  be able to learn something new. I have never done Photography before. I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings. I would appreciate it if you also advise me on how much money I should take. It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before. Please send me additional information soon. Thank you for your time and your kind effort. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  When you think of the word 'shopping' a smile always comes onto your face. Shopping is thought of as enjoyable. Teenagers go shopping for leisure and to socialize. There are more than one kind of shopping though and one particular kind is window-shopping. I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up at a high street to go shopping. For me, that was window-shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew thought that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway. I went back everyday just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money. When I received my monthly pay, I rushed down to the shop and without thinking, bought that dress. I went back to where I was before - with no money (and a black dress) all over again. When I think about it now, shopping is not always enjoyable. ",39.0
1003," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter, so I write  you to give you some informations from me. I would like to travel on July because I finish school on June and I go to Great Britain on August for one month. If I can choose my accomodation, I prefer living in  tent. I prefer this accomodation because I think it's more easy to met people when you live in  tent, near them, than when you live in  log cabin. I want playing tennis and  swimming. I didn't play tennis before, so I am not good. I go to  swimming-pool two time by week, so I am good at this sport. Could you tell me what sort of clothes I will have to wear to play tennis? Could you tell me if I will need money for paid my dinners? Yours sincerely. Eric Durand  [SEP]  There is a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to chose some of them. I think the best choice is to show many types of activities. We could show  team spirit of our school with sport activities like soccer, basketball or handball. We could also show cultural activities: there is a lot of clubs of music or painting  in our school. I think it could be interested to show how students work to write the new paper of school. At the end, we can also show where we can be relaxed. We should filmed our pub and  room of students. All this activities which should be filmed, are  our daily life at our school. ",21.0
693," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing this letter to let you know my decision about  your letter, which I have received recently. I would like to thank you for  competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition. I think, I could have an holiday just in July because I will have been working in my previous company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one month holiday period from my company. I would rather prefer to stay in the tent than to stay in the log cabin because the tent is more enjoyable. I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailling because I have been joining these kinds of activities for five year and I had  really good training about sea-sports. Should I take my clothes with me or are they arranged in the camp placement? Also, how much does it cost. I am looking  to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I hope you and all your family are well and everything is ok. I'd like to tell you about what exciting experience I had last month during a pop concert. I wish you were there and saw the concert, it was really brilliant. As you know I'd never been to any activities like to be a valunteer before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an adversitement on the tv. It said, ""be a valunteer for our concert and get a free ticket"". After that I applied and they accepted my application. You should have seen , there was  really terrible rush before  concert and everybody was runing around to do something. I helped to carry huge speakers to the concert venue. Than I was told to stay in front of the entrance door and check the tickets. Some people tried to enter without any ticket but they weren't allowed  by  police. Finally, I helped them,  in return I had  good experience as well as enjoyed listening   music. Love ",28.0
182," 17.06.2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I have recently been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow'. To my regret, the evening totally failed to live up to my expectations. The advertisement provided false information, e.g. the names of the actors were incorrect - Danny Brook was not performing. I have to say, this fact disappointed me very much. Moreover, the show started late: instead of 19.30 ( time in the advertisement) people were allowed in at 20:15, resulting in  waiting time of 45 minutes. There were two other problems: there were no discounts contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repairement works. This evening, as you can see, proved to be far from perfect. Therefore, I would like to have my money back. Please contact me for more details if necessary. Yours faithfully, Miss Nitya Ramel  [SEP]  We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices, which would seem fantastic to our ancestors. My daily life has been changed much by modern technology without me noticing it up to this point. Just looking around, I realise that modern technology has crept into every area of my life. I would rather type some coursework up than hand-write it. This made my life easier, and at the same time saved some trees in a rainforest from being cut . When I am too tied to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with this opportunity. Using the Internet, I can meet people  all around the world not going anywhere. With all the resources on the Net I don't need to go to the library as often as I used to. I guess I haven't realised until now how much my daily life has been changed by modern technology. This leaves me wondering how beneficial its influence is for me. ",39.0

As  your questions, I am free to travel only on July because I will having my holiday after finished the exams. And, I have to returned to my university by August. I prefer to stay in  log cabin rather than in  tent because I am not used to with narrow space and feel more comfortable with a place like  bedroom. Furthermore, I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fasinative in art and enjoyed to take a photograph of wildlife. Finally, please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring? and how much would be  spend there. Also, please advice  for any necessary things to prepare and bring.

What a surprised! and unbelieveable, I was responsible for looking after the pop stars. You might understand how excited I was. But, I've got though it. I have to taken care of them during a break, served a drink,  clothes,  even brought them some cigaratte and anything they wants. I think they are so hospitality and warm with people around them.

908," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I was writting as reply of your letter, I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA. About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I  got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month  holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months. With the accomodation, I would prefered  tents becase it is more according with a camp. And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things. Finally I just  ask you What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me, and around How much money do you think I will need. Thank you very much for everything. Your Sincerely Juanita Fabiola Martin  [SEP]  31 Sea old State Valles Co. Cornel Wales 13th June, 2000 Dear Kim, Here I am, writting  you to tell  everything about my wonderful experience at the concert. You can't imagine How much did I enjoy that journey. I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played, I help with the music stuff like speakers, mics, lights, sound , etc. And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started. And I was helping them fixing the last details. When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty. After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean. Later the band was talking to me, I could get their new album free, and some other souvenirs from the band. But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions. So, that's everything that I can tell you, I enjoy  a lot and I hope to have another experience like this. ",27.0
663," Dear Helen Ryan, I received your letter and would be glad to travel two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July for in June I will be in Austria with a friend and in August I have rented an appartment with my family. I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping. While I am at the Camp I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play very well tennis since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice in photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it. I would like to ask you a few questions: What kind of clothes should I bring? Will you give clothes for  activities? How much money should I bring there? Faithfully Yours, Pascal Fritz  [SEP]  Although many people enjoy shopping, shopping is not always enjoyable. You can fall on a very disagreable sellor and if you find what you wanted, you will not want to pay him or her for it. Sometimes the seller might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor. For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two sellers are talking and although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor. There is nothing more disagreable than that. Also, when you find a nice sellor and he shows you lots of objects, when you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose his or her time so you feel obliged to buy something. All this  to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not. ",27.0
578," Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to see that I win the first prize in your competition. I am going to answer your questions. Firstly, I would like to travel on July because I have some holidays during this month. I am working the rest of this summer. For the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is probably more comfortable. I think we are going to be tired so I prefer to sleep comfortably. You also asked me about two activities. I choose singing because I love singing and I am in a choir for 7 years now. I also choose climbing. Unfortunately I am not so good in it. But I would take the opportunity to improve myself. In addition, I have some questions. I would like to know which sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Our life of today is getting even more about consommation. You always find more shops and they are open even more late. You can't live without shopping but shopping is not always enjoyable. Firstly, if you try to do your shopping during the rush hour, it could be very difficult. Everybody is stressed, you have to make the queue. It is not comfortable at all. In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices. You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price. But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality. And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality. Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you. In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find. Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant. You could try to do your shopping via  Internet. Perhaps you will find  less inconvenience. ",35.0
594," Mrs/Miss Helen: Thank you very much for your letter. It is excellent to have won this prize. To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of I think I did well, I had to play against a very strong competence. The idea about going to California for 2 weeks make me feel very excited. According with your letter, July is the period of time  suits me best. My job is less demanding in July. About the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a tent. I have never done it before, so I really fancy the idea. I am really surprise about how many activities can be practised in this place. If  is possible I would like swimming. I am very good at swimming. On one hand I think that climbing sounds very exciting, but on the other hand it scares me a lot, so I will play tennis. I am not so bad at tennis but I would like to improve my style. By the way, I would like to know if the level of life in  USA is similar to  UK. How much money should I bring with me? Another point is about the clothes, could you confirm me that I'll need summer clothes? I would be very pleased . Please if you need further information from me, don't hesitate to contact me again. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Normally I enjoy really much shopping. In fact when I don't feel very happy I decide to do shopping to try to cher myself up. And really, it works. But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate  when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like  when I have to try on differents sizes because the small  doesn't fit on my body because I have got weight. It is in this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling. I think women, in general, are very impulsive  purchasing things. Many times we buy things that in fact, we don't need and, sometimes you  surprise when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down  your expenses for 2 months. But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and don't spend it as you want. At the end of the day money is just money. ",32.0

My school starts a summer holyday from 1st July and I am going to take a summer course from August. Therefore, I would like to travel in the middle of July. I also would like to prefer log cabins for accommodation. It seems more comfortable than tents. Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis for activities. I have been belonging to a swimming club and I got second prize in a competition last summer. I am good at tennis as well as swimming. Finally, I would like to ask you about clothes and money. What short of clothes should I prepare? According to your letter, all travel costs are included in your service, however, how much pocket money do I need? I would be grateful if you would give me more information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Rie Tanizaki  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Most people like shopping. Especially it is one of the hobbies for women. Basically, shopping is fun, but is it always enjoyable? There are some advantages when people go shopping. They can refresh, reduce ther stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted. Moreover, if they buy some nice things at  sale, they must be very satisfied. However, shopping sometimes make them stressfull. People often waste money for unvaluable things. Then, they really regret it. On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one. In addition, a shop assistant gives them a wrong advice. To sum up, there are many disadvantages as well as advantages. If people want to enjoy shopping, we must consider before buy something - do I really want it? I also recommend a window shopping. It is the best way to enjoy shopping. You do not have to waste money at all. ",27.0

It was a suprise when we were told there will be another actor. Also we expected to get a discounts as a students, but international students cards are not available in your theater (that is very strange - even your advertisment has an information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was postpone  45 minutes! so we were late to our supper in the hotel and  theatre restaurant was also closed without any risons . In the advertisment it was written ,,your perfect evening out!"" , but it wasn't. And I think, I prooved you this. I'm waiting for your anser and hope I can get my money back!

It is very intresting for me how new works, there possiblyties. My job, I think is a good way to become a profesion in the future. And I hope to find a realy good job in a good company. Communication business is a very progressive. More and more people buing mobile phones, because it is very usefull, you get a lot of possiblyties like: use an internet, buy different goods, book tickets, control your home technic and many authers.

I am delighted that finally, I have won the first prise in your Competition. I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July that means I will not be able to come there  later. Moreover, I would rather stay in a tent than in a log cabin because I always stay in a tent when I am on holidays. It is not comfortable but it still like it. Concerning to the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good in it because I have attended a relevant course for three months. According to my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I have to bring with me? (like.. specific equipment or anything else). How much money do I need? I am looking forwards to hearing from you Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"" Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people not. If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot. On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue. You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it  very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to. In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy. Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood. You should avoid the peak times. ",26.0
211," Dear Sir or Madam: I am writing this letter I  order to complain  my unpleasant experience in your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show ""over the rainbow"" at your theatre. The advertised beginning time is 19:30. But due to some unknown reasons, the play didn't start until 20:15. The audience were anxious and bored. What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear at the stage at all. A second-class actor took the place of him. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the conductor didn't offer me any discounts as you had advertised in the poster when I bought the ticket. I am sorry to say that I do not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all. I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation. I am waiting for your reply. Yours Faithfully   [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use, our living condition becomes more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around in the house, it is easy to find things like these:  microwave oven, TV set, computer, etc. All these  equippments are the applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose  train, car or even  plane as your  transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination. Second, Modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable. With the spreading use of  Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other through the web. And, we can also share important informations with other people. The development of information technology has changed the world into ""an earth village"". Modern technology plays an important role in our life. I am hoping to devote myself into the development of it. ",27.0

466," Dear Sir or Madam, I have recently been to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show. It was advertised as London's Newest and best musical show. However, it had been a very dissappointing evening for me. Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two starrings but, in fact, only an actor were performing on the show. Secondly, there was a delay on the show which supposed to started at 19.30 but, it was actually started at 20:15. This really upset me as no notice were given before the show. Thirdly, the advertisment said that the discounts were avaliable but, the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or avaliable. In addition, the advertisment mentioned that  restaurant will be opened after the show but it was closed because, short of cooker. Finally, I would like to ask for  money back for the ticket due to the disapointing evening out and  unreliable advertisement you have created. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Cook Phatosub.  [SEP]  Nowaday, modern technology is becomming very essential to our daily life. As it is another important factor which affects our life, apart from money, health, food and house. The reasons it is important to us are, first of all, if you think bout life without computers, communication machines and transportation machines. We wouldn't be able to sort out informations and datas this quickly. Secondly, no one could communicate on the phone through countries or even through houses as immediate as nowadays. Lastly, it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travel by plane. Without all this you life would definately change back to the same position as it were 50 or more years ago. Put it in another words, modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every ways. On the other hand, the affects that it has on our daily life is not always good as sometime, the technology went wrong and out of hand of people who control it can cause disaster accidents, for example: plane crashes, trains crashed and  explosion of nuclears bomb. If this continue to happen our life would be very misarable as accident happens all the time. Therefore, it is important to get it exactly right. ",19.0
1050," 12.12.0 Dear Mr Robertson; I am writing in reference to the programme for the English class, that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I agree with that, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to  River trip to Greenwich, Also, they can visit  Science Museum, and they can going to the shopping, on Wednesday 15 March they  going to visit The National Art Gallery, really, I think that is  good programme. However, I think as well, that the class would like to visit ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"",  is on Tuesday from 10.00 AM until 19.00 pm. They don't need to pay. In addition, I think  is a good a idea, because they could go after shopping, when they have a free time, I am sure about that, they will like to visit that place. However, the programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody. Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand  accept you personal opinion as well. I look forward  hearing from you. Your faithfully  [SEP]  12.12.00 My personal opinion about famous people, is  good in one way and bad in another way. I think that they live their life like hat, because they want to live this life. They doing everything just for money,  sometimes, they can make theirs life easier than they  normally do. It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalist following them all the time, however this news give them money, and  confortable life. Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, they live happy, because they know that the famous mean to be rich. They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be a very good peaple, because ""the Famous"" is just for a few time, nothing is forever in this world. My personal opinion is that, I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well. I do not really like will be a famous person, because you are not really yourselfh, and for me  is the more important thing. Your faithfully ",23.00
1132," Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we write this letter to you, is because we would like to thank you for this short trip in London. We believe that the programme is very cood and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that. The other reason as I mention earlier is because of a request off all the class. We've seen an advertisement in the newspapers, about a Fashion exhibition in London on Tuesday the 14 of March. That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a college. So we had this great idea if it is possible of course to include this exhibition in our programme. The exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it taking place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London From 10.00 till 19.00. The class is very exiting about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make up and hair styles. We believe that  is a great opportunity because  is one of the best shows of the year, also a majority of the class never had the change to visit a show as this and the most important and best part is that the admission is Free for Students. And that we found it very good as otherwise we could not afford it. So please if it is possible  to make a small change to the programme and to move the activities of the Tuesday 14 of March to the 15 of March  as to try to make a combination of the 2 days. We hope we do not cause any problems to your programme and hope that you will except our request. From all your class Thank you  [SEP]  ""FAME"" What a word!! I'm sure that the people that had decided to meet this word they did not realised that there is a price to pay. I believe that any famous people such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for a various reasons. First of all they are humans like everyone else, so yes everyone want privacy in their lifes. is the same right for all of us as a human be. Of course on you are on the public eye, the reasons are different when you want privacy. Becaues if you are a politician as an exmaple, you fear for your life. You need to protect your life of any danger. Becaue  ",25.00
5," Dear Jean Clark, I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it. Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement. Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them. I look forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear George, Sorry it's been too long since I last wrote but I've been so busy at school that I couldn't answer you before. As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First I must tell you that  teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good,  mum and dad are great but there's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem  she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it. I really must get down to some homework now so I'll stop here. Give my love to your parents. Write to me soon ",29.00
673," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter in which you communicate  I have won first prize in your competion. I am glad. Thank you very much. Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know  further information about travel and accomodation. I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at University and at the moment I do not know the exact date. I can tell you I am only free in July. I would prefer an accomodation in  log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent. As regard as the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to practise painting and photography. I am a painter in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes, people, animals. I like also taking photographs, for example during my journeys or trips. So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting. Would you give me some information about  clothes to wear there? I would like also to know how much money I can bring. Looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely, Billy Esposito  [SEP]  There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable' and who is happy only when  can go shopping. In the first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty. If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch, doing shopping is a terrible activity. On the other hand if you can walk  without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable. For istance, it is funny enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt although you do not buy anything. To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not. I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends. In my opinion, shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday. ",29.0
659," Dear Madame, I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know  to have won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, call the information you need to complete the partecipation procedure. I would like to travel only on July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at the Cornell University: this school is closed on July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the  accomodation I prefer is in tent. there are two main reasons for the choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the relative activities: building-up the tent, cooking on camp and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the camp daily life (the tent, the sleep bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like the water sport and I am a quite good guitar  singer - Some questions: What about the average temperature at the camp on July? What are the better clothes to use at the camp? How much money may be useful at the camp? I will be very glad to partecipate to your camp! Yours faightfully Steve Galliano  [SEP]  Our school, as it is well known, is a technical school and consequently the daily life contains different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, showed to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed to create the video. The mathematical lessons are divided in two part: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the laboratory of physics and in the laboratory of chemistry. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will be surely enclosed in the video. Moreover, many sport activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on. Some parts of the final video may describe these additional features of the school. ",32.0
845," Dear Ms. Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really amazed to have actually won first prize after years of unsuccessfully entering competitions! In connection with the questions you asked, please find my answers as follows: - I could prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave. - As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersome to me. - My choice of sports are swimming and tennis. Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years. Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so. Please let me know if meals are included and if not which facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self-catering. Looking forward to hearing from you, I remain, Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The book Cry Freedom by John Briley is certainly one which will take its place in South African history. Therefore, I think it is a time document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again, also by non-South Africans. Generations of young South Africans black, white or brown will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years. A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force. In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment. It is my firm believe that this book will remain a piece of literature which will not lose its actuality, in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion. ",35.0
428," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show advertised in your latest leaflet. First of all, I would like to say that it was the worst performance I had ever seen and it disappointed me very much. Although your advertisement stated that the main actor would be Danny Brook, it was not him and a different man  was not prepared for the role. Secondly, you advertisement stated that the second show should start at 19:30. It was not true because the audience had to wait until 20:15. Then, I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket, although I am not  adult yet. Finally, I was hungry after waiting for the show and wanted to order something to eat. It was, however, impossible because the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons. I would like you then to send the money back to me because I did not enjoy the show at all and the ticket costed a fortune. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She heard from her friend Jon that Paul, the worst pupil at school, had thrown an enormous frog inside the desk of Miss Colston, their English teacher. Miss Colston was an old woman, who wanted her pupils to understand and admire English novels and poems. But the children were bored during her lessons and Paul was very disappointed that she didn't read any funny stories. So he decided to scare the old woman away from school. Now he thought it was stupid to tell Jon about it, as he was the best friend of Pat. ""Oh, that girl will cause some problems"" - he thought when Miss Colston entered the classroom. She approached the desk and wanted to open it, but suddenly Pat shouted - ""Miss Colston, please, don't do that. There's a frog"". The teacher stared at the whole class and calmly whispered - ""Who did it?"" ""Oh, God"" - thought Paul - ""the next time I will throw a frog inside Pat's rucksack."" ",40.0
1082," Dear Mr Robertson, With reference to our trip in London, in name of all of us,  English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special atention in have organised a good programme to know  interesting and cultural points in London. We have been very excited about this and coincidentely we have found another option to add in our programme, certainly if your agree with . We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions, Leisure, sports and style of life. However  your decision in changing a little bit our programme, we would suggest just on Tuesday afternoon no doing shop,  everything else could stay the same. We are really satisfied in  sightseeing by bus,  in go to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion  and  will be free. We are looking forward to your answer. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  I knew, I could die. It was dangerous, but I kew I had to do it. This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998,  it wasn't 13th even it look liked , but it was my 25th birthday. Everything was going so bad and I knew, I could die. Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in  dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, in my 25th birthday. I was at home making me up before to go to a restaurant with my friends and, sudenlly, he rang the bell, he was so nervous with a gun in his hands and no longer I could speak he took me out with him. I had tried to think in stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scared me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques. I didn't want ,  I've never approve  his deal with the drug, but I couldn't do it different. The dangerous man who we'd gone to buy drugs  was upset with my brother and had decided to kill him, but I had killed him first. If I didn't do it, I knew I would die, my option was my life, but now I haven't any chance to live because I'm in the prison. ",22.00
30," Ideas to improve the Festival Dear Jane Clark, I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I write to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not. Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is International. But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all  the world and I saw only six nationalities. Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent and the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year. Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. It attracted a lot of people and they were really joyous after that. Finally, the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind of people an afford to buy it. I also think that you should put a Snack-Bar or a little restaurant so as the people are not too hangry and morever you can realise big benefits In conclusion, in the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve . I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Home and school rules Dear Andrew, I receive your letter and thank you for it. I am very happy to hearing from you and I hope that you are fit. As expected, I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home. As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000. In our class, we don't have  problem with students who dislike to work, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there  years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long. In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons. It is the same in our family and for example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that I let dust everywhere. When I go out, they don't give me an hour to be at home, because I don't exagerate. In conclusion, I don't want to change something in my house or at school, because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have. I hope these few  information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you Best wishes ",26.00
89," Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was an other actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to , the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed for all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there wasn't any discount! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I hadn't a great fun, so I ask for  money back. Your faithfully  [SEP]  In fact, some days before Karin, a friend of hers, had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John, her science's teacher. Pat was astonished, and didn't know what (she) had to tell Karla. The teacher was 40 years old, and Karla was only 16 (years old). This age's difference was too big! Besides, Karla was a shy, polite girl that Pat wanted to help. So she decided to tell Hill all the story. Hill like Pat very much, but only as a friend. He was 19 (years old), so Pat thought, that he had to know what was the best thing to do. But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousine. They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream. So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they had know her feelings to Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything forever. ",25.0
249," Dear Sir/Madam, I have just returned from my holiday in London. During my stay I went to see a musical show in the Circle Theatre and I have  very disappointing evening. Firstly I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw diffrent actors. What is more you advertize there were discounts available but it were not. You said that the musicial show started at 19.30 but recently it began at 20.15. I was very bored because I did not have anything to do when I was waiting for your show. Additionally I felt very hungry and uncomfortable because your theatre restaurant was closed and you did not give us any reason why. You promised us a big show and  perfect evening but it was only an average show with unknown actors. In my opinion you are not very respectful and responsible. I will never trust you again. I would like you give me my money back as soon as possible. I am looking foward to hearing from you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. As I remember I have known her for ever. She had always been my best friend and I had said her everything. We lived in the same street and the weekends we spent together. When I had 16 years old I fell in love with the most hundsom boy in our school. Paul was older than me and he was playing basketball. Only Pat knew about my lover. One day he invited us for his party. I was very happy and nervous. Everything was great. But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me. Everybody started to laught at me. I was angry and I run away to the forest. 'She was my best friend, how can she do it to me' - - I was crying. When I was walking through the forest I saw a very tall man who was staying in front of me. 'My name is Jon' - he whispered - 'Don't be afraid'. We started to talk. This alien was so intelligent and funny that I forgot about my troubles. We talked for all night and I fall in love with him. We met again and again and now Jon is my husband. Maybe it was good that Pat was so talkative. ",27.0
1116," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to thank you for the well organised programme you have done. It will be a good opportunity for visiting London and its interesting places like the Science Museum. In addition it is properly to mention you that all the students of my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure show, which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall. The London Fashion and Leisure show is an amaizing show because there are parades with the latest fashions, we could know some famous top models Besides there are a variety of clothes either sport wear as elegant desings. Not only we could see the latest trend in make-up but hairstyles performed by important coiffeurs. With your agreement we could change the programme. Maybe we could go on shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to The Show. We would like to have  reply  to became making the arrangements. Many thanks again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I have never imagined I had to face this situation. I joined with an expedition team in order to explore the Rocky Mountains. We planned a programme. We arrived to the place in the morning and started to walk. Every thing was marvellous, I got on well with all the partners. The landscapes were the most beautiful that I had ever seen before. The weather was delightful, except  this afternoon when  started to rain and we decide to stay during the night inside a hole in the wall of the mountain. I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it, when a rain of stones covered the entrace of the hole. I was terrified, I knew that the only solution was to ask for helping. I walked alone a long distence until I found a telephone, I called the police and they ask for a rescue. Thanks to God everything finished in a good way. and my partners were successfully rescued.

459," Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago. I went to see it on 5th June 2000. First of all that evening there was not Danny Brook but an unknown and not very good actor. Secondly the show started 45 minutes late. Then at the tickets-office I was said that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full prize despite  I am a student. Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not been already closed because the show finished, obviously, late. I am really not satisfied with the show-organization particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something different. For this reason I expect to receive my money back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secret. Last week we had another demostration of this. On Monday we decided to organize a surprise-party for Ted's birthday on Tuesday evening. Each of us had a different task. Anna prepared the cake, Peter organized the music, Heather and I went to buy the present; Pat said: ""OK I'll phone to some of Ted's friends to invite them"". Obviously Ted should  have known nothing about it and we remembered it to Pat twice: ""the party is a secret!!"" and she said: ""Yes, it must be a surprise!"" On Tuesday afternoon we met to prepare the last details; Pat said: ""I've just phoned to Tommy, Billy and Alison and I met Ted yesterday evening: they all have said ok for the party..""

613," Dear Mrs. Ryan Thank you for your informing letter and your congratulations. I was very delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize. I'm very looking forward to it as I've never been in the U.S.A. before. Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August. Any two weeks during July will suit me perfectly. The best term would be from 17th July till 30th July. As for accommodation at Camp California, I prefer  tent. I'm used to sleep in  tent from my previous holidays and I always injoyed it. I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are based on sharing and how many people is there in one tent. I really appreciate the choice of activities at the camp. It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it. I'm also good at swimming and surfing but I'd like to try sailing. I was always attracted to it but never had an opportunity . Is it possible to start to learn it at Camp California? I'd also like to know how far is it to the nearest village and how much cash do I need for  two-weeks stay at the camp? Do I need to bring with me some special gear or equipment? I'm looking forward to hear from you again. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim In my last letter I promised to write  you about my experience working at  pop-concert. The job came unexpectedly as my friend, who was supposed to work there, broke her leg just two days before the event. So she asked me to fill her position. Even  I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend. The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them. When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor. However, I manage to listen  the music and I must admit that I liked it. I actually injoyed it working there and I wouldn't hesitate to work there again. As I know you like this ",37.0
1126," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisment about The London Fashion And Leisure Show. First of all I would like to thank you for making such a good plan, for us, so we could have a good time. Then I would like to explain to you about The London Fashion and Leisure Show. Finally  how the programme could be changed. The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in  Central Exhibition Hall in London and happens on Tuesday March 14. From ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the afternoon. The reason that I suggest that we go is that it is a great opportunity because we can see the latest fashions,  leisure and sports wear as well as make up and different hairstyles. In addition to these we will not have to pay anything since it is free for students. I suggest that we should transfer our visit to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon in our free time that we have. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I had to do it. I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble. I had to become a burgler again and steal jewelry from the jewelry shop near by. As I knew the teknics to break in a place without being noticed, I should not be afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country which was very well secured. When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily was not. Then I approached slowly the door, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were laisers all over the place, with which I had to be careful with. Suddenly something went wrong, the alarm was making  noise. I ran towards the diamond grabed it got out quickly,  ran out of the back door. By surprise I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car  gave the jewelry in exchange of my brother, took him and left the place. ",26.00
880," Dear Helen, I was very glad to receive this great notice. I am very excited about it. I entered in this competition because I have always wanted to do these kind of things. In your letter you asked me when I would rather travel, I will be able  only on July because I have to work and I can take some days off on this month. If it is no problem I would rather stay in a lab cabin because I do not like much sleeping on the floor, but if you can not put me there I will be fine anywhere. About the  I have to choose I would like to tell you something. I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to practice new ones, if it is possible. I am keen on water and risk sports so I would choose climbing and surfing, I think it would be great if I learn them while I am there. Finally, I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs, so to take some money with me and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes. Thank you for everything. I am looking forward to travelling. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Every woman in the world likes the word shopping. It is like if they lose their concience while they are shopping. You can do shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing of it is that you feel that you have all the power while you are buying things. May be it is not for you, may be it is a present, but buying things at least for me it is the best. But all this power and all this excitement could turn into something that you could start to hate. When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carying about anybody, this could get crazy to anyone. The long queues, close places, hight prices, sales, all these things conbined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it. But my advise for people, who like it so much that  can not help doing it, is to try shopping in the afternoon, at this hour no-one do shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall.

598," 13th June 2000 Helen Ryan Competition Organiser Dear Madam, I am writing in response to your letter, in which you told me I am the winner in your competition, and my intention is to try to give you all the information you may need according to your letter. I would like to travel in July because I had another trip to Spain in August, that is the perfect month for me, otherwise I would not travel to Spain. About accommodation, I would prefer  tents instead of  log cabins and the reason is I have never used tents and this could be a very exciting experience for me. The two activities which I find  better for me are swimming and sailing. I love the sea, that is why I became interested in those activities since I was ten, therefore I have a lot of experience in both. Could you give me some advice about the weather in California? Thank you very much for everything. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, ION GAYARRE  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, Thank you for asking about my latest good experience, I  let you know what the important details were. As you know I helped at a pop concert last month, I did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments, organise people, and also look after the clothes of the artists. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only wait there and give them what they asked for. Organise people involved, just a couple of things, say to people how to do the same as me and when. The most exciting thing was to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to the listen to the Concert in the very first position. All that I can say now is that I would do it again, I will never forget that day. Looking forward to seeing you, Best Wishes ",25.0
861," Dear Sir/Madam, I was very pleased to receive your letter which informed me of my winning the first prize in your competition, namely two weeks at Camp California in the USA. To begin with, I would like to travel in July. This is the only possible time for me, as the school holiday starts on the 29th of June. And from August on I planed to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money. Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days. As I had been asked to choose two activities I would like to  during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I get lessons in it. I just love singing. I would like to know whether there is some facilities for washing the Clothes. Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily. Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me. Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollar? I ask you to enclose the answer in your reply. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Yours faithfully Mee-Yon Areum.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoires etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be. Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search of an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends. Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without ""touching"" the others. It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out. Of course, shopping is not always so unpleasant, but sometimes it is simply better to stay at home. ",34.0
567," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am replying to your letter for the first prize of the competition, that I won and there are a number of thinks I would like to make clear. You asked me in your last letter when I would like to travel. I think the best time is the first two weeks of July, because I will be free then. I cannot travel earlier because I take an examination and I have to study for it. In addition, I would prefer to have a log cabin, because I am not used to sleeping in a tent, so it would be very difficult for me. at the beginning You state in your last letter that I will have the chance to do two activities. I would prefer basketball and swimming. When I was younger I attend I local basketball team and we became local champions, so I am good at basketball and have a lot of experience. I am also good at swimming. Last year I entered a swimming championship and won the silver medal. Finally, there is one think I would like to ask. Could you tell me what sort of clothes and how much money I should have with me? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Many thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you again. As you know, I helped  at a pop concert last month. and I must say it was fantastic. Let's start from the beginning. First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars. I had to iron them,  put them in order, so that the pop stars, who will sing at the concert,  look impressive. and handsome. The most exciting things happened later. I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful. I had a lot of things to do during the concert. I had to look after the tone that nothing goes wrong. That was very responsible but fortunately I had help from other person. I must say that being in a concert is very nice. But helping in a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all your need is co-operation and  don't think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Pantelis ",33.0
801," Dear Helen Ryan. Thank you for your letter. I am so happy to win the prize and come true my dream. I would like to travel to California this July, because I can take an holiday from 14th to 27th of July. I would prefer log cabins. I have never used it and I think it would be more exciting than tents. I have heard that the Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time. Besides, I will take the chance to play golf. It is my only favorite hobby. What about clothes and money? I don't know what the weather is like, and you are paid for travel costs, but I am wondering that it is included two activities. Also, I have a dog. Can I go with him. Please, let me know  this questions as soon as possible. I appreciate your competition and I look forward to hearing your answer Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim I am sorry. This letter is late, because last week I took exams, so I was very busy. To reply  your answer, it was realy an nice experience. As you know, I like a pop music so much and  singer was one of my favorite singers. Also, in the future I'll want to be an organizer like  this concert, so it'll be useful the experience to me. I am writing  how I got the position and what I did. Firstly, I applied to a concert agency to help, because I had the experience before and I knew how to organize and what to do. In the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments. It was somewhat hard to me. After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again. If you have some questions, let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you With best wishes, ",28.0
297," Dear Sir Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was played in your theatre those last weeks I want to explain you  some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement and as a result of it, all the problems that I had . First of all, I think if you go to a play and you are watching to see your favourite actor playing a good play and then  appears a silly one, who doesn't know what to do, it is disappoint at all. Secondly, all the spectators were waiting  the begining of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15 then I would like to know why do you say one time in the advertisement  why do you do what you want. Another thing that I want to know is why you didn't do any discount if it was showed in the advertisement. Maybe, I could be a good way to get spectators but I'm going to comunicate that to my travel office. When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because like on the paper that was on the door was writen, it was too late. I think, that it wasn't my perfect evening out so I wait to be payed back. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so she lost all her school friends. All started when she was fifteen, when  started a new course on the institute and met some girls that passed the time they would became her friends. Three years passed and like is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them like her friends knew a lot about her When it was time to do the final exam, she became ill and she couldn't do it so  teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks but on the other hand the principal desagreeded with it and didn't give the permision to pass her. She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and like is usuall  girls from the last course became popular. Pat, to win her new classemates' friendship tell all what she knew about her friends and owing to what Pat said, her friends broke they friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged. Pat's classmates made the same and Pat finished alone. ",23.0
25," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about the International Arts Festival which has just finished. I congratulated with you because it has been a great idea since the town needed a cultural event. I especially appreciate the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford, also students like me. However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances. You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have appreciate seeing more of them. For next year's edition, you could possibly add some foreign films, like the Chinese ones, which I most like. Finally, in order to make  a really international festival, I think you should invite artists from all over the world, not just from six countries like this year. I hope that you will appreciate my opinions and suggestions, which I have shared with my friends.  Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Simply a good idea and that's enough Are you young and full of life but you don't have enough money to enjoy your spare time? Simply let your brain work and you could find out wonderful ideas to earn money enjoying yourself. Are you fed up of looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend. Are you keen on music and you love going to disco? With a short training  you'll be able to mix songs at parties. You won't dance but the earning is guarantee! Do you like do-it-yourself and your house is full of marvellous but unuseful things? You could sell them to a specialised shop and finally tidy up your room!  So, what are  waiting for? Work out your own idea and realise it: money won't be a problem for you anymore! ",34.00
854," Dear Helen Ryan, I have received your letter today and I would  to thank you for the first price. The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communication firm and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. For the accommodation at camp, I prefer in the log cabins, because  few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent, it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet so for this fact, I choose the log cabins. For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming, I am in the Swimming Team and I must go two times per week to entretain me because I have  competition every weekend. My second choice, it is Basketball. I have played basketball at school and I was one of the best player after that, I decided to coach a team but I should stop because I have started  swimming competition. For these two weeks, what kind of clothes I must take? It is including the transport and travel, but for the food and extra hobbies I must take some money. Could you tell me approximatively  Your sincerely M. Bruni  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm fine. You know last month I helped at a pop concert as like security. It was a very good experience. The concert sarted at 6:00 pm  until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear the scene with the musicians. After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and you know it was incredibale because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row. There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman. I saw old people, child.... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang, it was fantastic. If I had an other opportunity to do that I think that I will do. Write  me as soon as possible.  ",26.0
729," 13th June 2000 Dear Ms Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I have just recieved the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize. I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am. I am therefore writing to give you my further information. First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. Because I intend to take  examination in Septenber. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried. The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it. And nowadays, I have been practicing tennis as  school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis. Finally, I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need. I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe  but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was. All  work I needed to do wasn't very interesting. which I must have set thousands  chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of  stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as  audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sit down there. Additionally, you couldn't believe , but the vocalist said ""All the chairs you are sitting down  were set  from him,"" pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory. Anyway it was so interesting  time that I didn't even feel tired after that. Finally, I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity. You must like it. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Can you send me the letter back writing what happend to you recently.

1080," Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, I am writing to thank you for organising  school's trip to London. The programme seems to be really interesting, especially visiting the Science Museum. However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is going to take place on  14th of March at  Central Exhibition Hall. Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make up or hairstyle. It would be  great opportunity to see this show, because we are all very interested in  fashion subject. What is more, admittion for students is free. Do you think that it would be possible to change the programme of our trip? In our opinion we could join the show on Tuesday, after visiting the Science Museum. It would not be a problem to go shopping on Wednesday in our free time. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. In these days, when we can see  picture of  famous person almost on every first page of the newspaper, it's a quite common topic . First of all, I think that famous people deserve to have  private life. Journalists should not follow them all the time, trying to make an interview or taking an 'interesting' picture. Secondly, I can really understand how annoying or depressing it can be. I think that deep inside famous persons are just ordinary people and like for all of us having a private life is important for  psychological condition. On the other hand, we could say that they decided to have such kind of life. Maybe they need to pay the price for being rich and popular? Maybe sometimes they need to sacrifice their privacy? In conclusion, I think that it is very hard to find an answer to this question. However, everyone needs to have some part of his life being a secret. ",33.00
948," Thank you very much for the prize. I turned crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition. I am just looking forward to going to Camp California. I've never been in the States before and having the chance to do it so makes me real happy. So let's answer the question you told me to in order to make that two weeks there as  funnier as possible. You asked me when would I like to travel to California. Definitely, in July. That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope just the sleeping one. That's the best suitable accomodation for a camping . It just keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience with the putt. I just hope not to get injured. One thing you have not told me is weather I have to pay  all things by my own in California or not. Please, let me know. Waiting for your answer, José  [SEP]  Dear Kim, As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part on the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me in the task, but that did not make it much easier. Any way, it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me. It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that. They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live. Great show. Next time come with me. I think Ernestina is coming to the city very soon. See you then! José ",34.0

First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared. When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but  started at a quarter past eight. Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for  discount but they weren't available. When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed. I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed. So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back. yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born.

75,"  Dear Sir I'm writting to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which held a few days ago. When I found the advertisement of  International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The specified thing  is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like. Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something  needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for  audience. In the addition when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films. Thanks for reading this letter, I'm looking forward to the next year's festival. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Magda It is lovely to get your letter so soon. You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind me of what I experienced during my teeenage . In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of  teenage. Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These always annoy the school teacher and  parents. In a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak  each other in the class. They had to finish homework in a limited time. They cannot oppose to the teacher, girls are not allowed to  make up and wear any accessories. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden me to make a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience. Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them  more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework,  don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad. I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon. Best wishes ",21.00

On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" in the ""Circle Theater"". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just  a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed because of renovations""! We thought it would be a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something. I would prefer getting my money back, instead of taking a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again! Sincerely Hedwiga Heinkel  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from the day on, that  he knows anything about our secret we will live in danger  being caught. We, that were Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me Hedwiga had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we won't attack them. We had this idea first, when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love of first slight and we were fascinated by the thought,  building a kind of the same organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heaed of some people paying, ""safty-money"", but never know the reason, until he found a big amout of money in my room. His thoughts combined and ready to go to the police he went out of our house, where me and my homies were just hanging aroud. He saw me and tolled me into my face you are a thief and a burglar and I will go now to the police, I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah fokes, that was the point I got interupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but when you will hear the end of my story than buy the ""Rossall-School-magazin"", net time again, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.

A cabin remember me too much to my home and is too confortable, that isn't what I want to have if I live in a wild area. My favourite sports are climbing and surfing, I'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practise. Yes, I have some questions on clothes, what should I take with me and how much money will I need? I hope, I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply on my ones. Yours, Vadim Titov  [SEP]  Dear Kim, You can't believe what I did last month. I was given the opportunity to build up the concert and of course I took my chance. First I arrived really early in the morning on the place, but the people were just working and I joined them. My duty was to montage the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't just easy. You had always some problems because like not having enough wire or the lamps were broken by the transport. The experience that I made was, that I had never worked in a such perfect team. I was able to ask anybody, and he answered detailly, althoug he was full of work. After the hard work we took cool drinks, sat down on the ground and enjoyed the pop concert. And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard job we all were a little proud to be here. Love, Vadim ",27.0
240," Dear manager, I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week. I feel disappointed because it was different to  the advertisement. First of all, the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there were two unknown actors in the show. I feel most disappointed about this. The show was started at 20.15 but actually it should  started at 19.30. Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned  discount is available. And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed because at that day was their day-off. But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you know it would be closed. I am afraid it was not a best musical show because all the things above was not an accurate as what we had been told. On the whole, I feel disappointed about the event and I would  have my money back. I look forward to hearing your reply. Thank you. Your faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I say this because of the experience I've had from her. Actually, we were quite good friends before the event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year. She is sitting next to me, we started to chat more and more, then we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually. Suddenly my heart was thumbing so quickly because I saw him? - A boy who is a new student. I know this is one right love, I'm absolutely besorrted of him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossip behind me then everyone would know I fancy him. But the thing which I've never expected is Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always make  joke on it, that makes me feel so embarrised: I was very angry at that time! Now, I don't talk to her anymore because I can't stand a person who I trusted betrayed me. I hope she would know that  was her fault and don't do it anymore. ",21.0

I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have freetime in July   at any day, any week, because I am still having my lesson at college and it will be finished at the end of June and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love  atmosephere of camping, but I wouldn't mind to stay in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to have swimming and Basketball. I have always found these kind of activity make me fell strong and  enjoy doing it. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing it up till now. I also used to be in a basketball team in school for 3 years. One thing, I would like to know is how many clothes I have to take with me and what kind of cloth they are? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Vanida Montri  [SEP]  Report on daily life at school Introduction The aim of this report is describ and assess  lesson and activities should be filmed in a short video. It is base on information made availble by student from each class at school. Lessons Most student who were interviewed suggested to have a speaking part of the lesson  to be on film. It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because student always make some mistake while they are practising with thier partner, in spite of having told from  teacher ten times. It felt to be a good memory to be remember and remind our sleves to speak in a correct way. This lesson will give us to be relaxed and have  laugh. We also would like to have a history on. Activities Going out to visit the history town every weekend seem to be the most enjoyable activity for student. Spending time together out of the class is the nice experiance. Having a sport after class it also fun. Conclusion Lesson and activities, which most student suggested are very interesting and it is not seem to be boring for the student. ",24.0
286," Dear Sir, I'm writting to you to make a complaint about your musical show: "" Over the Rainbow""... Last week, I, my husband and our two children went to your theatre spend a good time, but we were so disappointed. First of all, I think it's not professional to change the principal actor in the last minute, the play should be with Danny Brook, but it wasn't. In addition to this, the show started at 20:15 instead  19:30, more  45 minutes in late... Moreover, there weren't  discounts available like writting in your advertisement. There was well a restaurant, even though, it was closed for reparations, also 2 hours 30 without drinking or eating something, was quite difficult for the children. It should be a perfect evening out, but it was the opposite. It's why, it would be grateful, if you could give me my money back. I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Nowadays, I think it could be impossible for us to live like our grand-parents or great grand-parents lived... we are too lazy, but it's not our mistake, this revolution is called ""progress""! Every day, like everybody, I watch the TV, see the International news, hear the radio, play games on my computer or get across with American or Asia people without going out to my house. It seem be incredible, but it's commun habits for us.. we don't think that there is less of a hundred years , nothing of that existed. I will always said thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the maschines wich make the washing and the washing-up, before this, the women spent a long time had done this tasks.

528," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given. Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him. Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show. It began 45 minutes later than it should have been. Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket, it occuried to be impossible to have one. Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff. All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, T. Gens  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone. It was far too heavy to keep it for myself. So I made a mistake and I told her. The day after, at school, I noticed that everyone was looking at me. I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat. She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes. From this moment, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know  it sooner or later. It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse. I tried to take it on my stride but I couldn't. I was terrified. My fear turned out to be right. I read the hurt in her eyes. She knew. She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it. ",38.0
167," Sir manager of the theatre, I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show in your theatre. With a friend we had seen your advertisement for the show, witch was very attractive. Unfortunatly, the musical show didn't go like the advertisement explained, and that wise I wont ask you  some money back. The starring had been changed, the show had started only at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside. And your last phrasal of the advertisement  ""Your perfect evening out""! it wasn't  at all, like I have explain  you above in this letter. I thank you in advance an hope for a positive requiere. Bests regards,  [SEP]  At the began of my work in a Insurance Company, I had only a old writting machine, witch makes a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with it because the switch were hard for my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, witch is very easy to use, and confortable for my fingers  also more farrster. But wen the computer don't work, I got a big problem to do my work. Also now for write a letter to a friend overland it is better with  Internet. It is so practical, in five minuts my friend can read my letter. And he can ansewer me very quickly. I think, it is now the futur for the big company for work with the Internet. ",19.0
331," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show which I saw last week. It didn't go on as I had expected and I was really let down when it finished. Firstly, it was  to start at 19:30 a I bought my ticket for the evening session. However, it began at 20:15. I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long. Second, instead of being starred by Danny Brook, the musical was starred by another actor, who I found really disappointing. Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show. I asked for the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them. In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday. I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day of main audience . Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement said and that we all wished turned out to be a regret for the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm including my ticket and this list of complaints as the reason for returning some money. I'm looking forward to receiving your decision. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  My daily life has changed quite a lot with modern technology. I live more comfortably and  even more carefree than some years ago. I've been able to improve some things that could have annoyed me some time ago, and although they're mainly little changes they make me notice that my life is easier. At home, for example, my waking up is no more a surrounding sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program, set to start at seven o'clock. Then, when I was younger I would have to put the milk on the fire and wait until it was warm enough to drink. Nowadays, almost everybody have a microwaves oven, where you put your milk  less than two minuts and it is ready to delight your mouth. Another thing are the fifty-two steps which take me to the street. They have become as easy as calling the lift, without  feeling tired or even breathless, when I was in a hurry. Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out until later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of  Internet and its arriving to a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want. In brief, my life is taking the most out of the discoveries in science and technology and it can't be hidden that I'm really glad of that. ",33.0
1026," Dear Mr Robertson. I'm writing  you about our journey which you have already orginesed. First of all, thank you for your good programme. We saw your details and enjoyed  them. Especially  River trip to Greenwich and visiting  National Art Gallery. All the students in my class are excited about one more thing. We saw an advertisement about  Fashion And Leisure Show. It will be at  Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is Tuesday March 14. The show can be seen between 10.00 - 19.00. This show is about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles. One more thing about  show is,  it's free for students. Isn't it a big opportunity for us? As you know, there is a free time in your programme if you don't mind, we can go for shopping in this free time. This changing, give us an opportunity to go to  show on Tuesday afternoon. We hope you an accept our suggestion. It will make us so happy. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerally,  [SEP]  A PRIVATE LIFE All people have some difficulties about their job but some of them have more than the others. Reason for this;  they are famous and everybody wants to learn about them. Having a private life is important for everybody. I think, people want this. if you are a famous person, for example  singer, film star, politician or well-know footballer, you haven't get any choice. Because people want to learn about you everything. so journalists are following you all the time. I know, they are not like us. They are famous, but I think they need to be alone sometimes. They nead to be with their family in silence. This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them, too. I think  media must be more understanding. We don't have to learn  their every second. We have to remember that, they need a private life like us. We can love them without disturbing  too. ",33.00
410," 17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing . I was to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'. There I was  many problems. first of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up  to wait. The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different . They were worst than the previst actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious in spite of that. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am absolutely annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give  back  money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope  your answer soon. Finally, I want to say you this is the last time which I come to your theatre. Thank you. Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.  [SEP]  FASHION OF THE FUTURE I am going to write about what clothes will be worn in the future. I have gone out to the street and I have asked to people for this question. I have recollected all  answers and I have made this article. Most of people think that character people and clothes are together. They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amused, etc. I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon, very exciting. And people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will be more enjoyable than people  now because they will have many things to do. On the other hand, most of people in the future will wear glasses. It is because sunlight is very bad. At the end all people will be short-sight. In conclusion, I would like living in the future to check which clothes exactly they will wear. It is a point very interesting.  ",23.0
588," Dear Ms Helen Ryan, I am very pleased about the prize I just won in your competition. Thank you for choosing me. Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement. First of all, I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July. As my family's new restaurant is about to open in August, I need to help with the restaurant, which is expected to be rather busy. Secondly, I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp. I had  bad experience last time I lived in a tent. I was terribly attacked by a been and it still gives me nightmares! As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating to challenge  waves. I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future. In addition what kind of clothes shall I bring with me? How much money is  appropriate to carry? I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready? That was a pop concert of Steps in  M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean. A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform  other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to  other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well. I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying ""thank-you"" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene. All in all, it was a once-a-lifetime experience. Yours, ",38.0
745," Dear Sir/Madam. I've just recived your leter, and I must say that I am so surprised, I wasn't expecting to win it. I  still studing at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the begining of July. About the acomodation, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest. I've got some problem to sleep and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a ten. You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot wich are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choise, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather trained in climbing, I have done it once a mounth since I was 17. But in the other hand, I have never done surfing, I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to do it. I've got just one question to do, I know it is all include, but is there anything I will have to pay for? If there is, please let me know. I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon, and please let me know if you need any further information. Yours Faithfully:  [SEP]  First of all, I think we should have a protagonist for it. A good idea to start will be a clock alarm ringing close to his bed, because that's the way everyone get up in the morning, (unless the people who don't do anythink) After that, we should have a morning view of one of the most busiest London tube station in order to show stressed people going in and out, Including our protagonist going out peacefully with a couple of books on his hand - then the school's door, and him going in. After all this introduction,  will be the time to show some of the acitivities every one can join in the school, such as lesons or others like the library, our protagonist having a cofe with some coleagues in the cofe bar, the reception service.. And finally a view of all the students leaving the school would be a nice end. ",16.0
970," Dear Competition Organiser, I am writing to replay  your letter and to ask  more details about the competition. Firstly, I would like to say that I'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition. As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays on July. Is it suitable for you? As you mentioned about the accomodation, I would prefer stay in the tents, because it's more exciting and I really love camping. I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good in almost  of this activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it's misteries and I also like the watter, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I'm tall and very fast with the ball. Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed  to pay for food and things like that. I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay. sincerely Clara  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am writing to tell you some news and to ask a little bit about you. First of all, I'm going to tell the good news. Last month, I went to a pop concert with four bands . It was unbelivebly!!! Although it was 5.000 thousand people there, people could walk and dance without any problem. It was very well organised, the shows started in the exactly  time and the group were well performed too. I have contributed to the concert  selling some tickets to my friends. However  the success of the concert, at the end of  show some full gays started a big confusion and some people get hurt. It was depressing... Finally, I would like to know some news about you, What have you done? Be you studing a lot? Please write me a letter as soon as possible! Love from Clara. ",28.0
370," Dear Sir, I am writting this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called ""Over the rainbow"" with my wife and children. We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one. First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people  came to see him. However the man who took his place made a good performance, we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing. The times were not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold. As it started later, it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take. Furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual! In my opinion, the tickets were a little bit expensive and not many people could afford the price. We did not see any discounts! Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came before. I understand them. After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place. For these reasons I would like to have my money back because it was not a ""perfect evening"" as you said. But I think that if you take care more of the public, your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology is everywhere in our society. We use it daily and sometimes don't realize that things are changing in our daily life. The ways of transport are improving a lot this times. The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling. But cars created pollution: for exemple the green house effect. But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport  as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities. Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in  sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older. I think there is a link between technology and  sciences because they need each other:  sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches in  sciences. Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with  Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations I need for my studies. In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary because it's faster and you really find what you need. Furthermore we can find everything all the time. Technology is necessary to our society but I think it could be also dangerous if we don't use it in the good way.  ",30.0
704," Dear Helen Ryan, Thank you very much for  letter which I received last week. I was delighted to heard that I won the prize for two week at Camp California in the U.S.A. I would be able to travel in the first week of July 2000, because my college will finished on 28 June 2000. I needed 1 - week to prepare all I needed to take with me, It said that about accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents to log cabins. Staying in tents  more interesting than in log cabins and I always dream of sleeping in tents so my dream  coming true! I  always interested in sport, so I am very happy to do sport activity particularly Basketball and tennis. When I was at secondary school I used to play for a school team and I am very good at them. The last reason  I love to watch basketball and my favourite team was Chicago also my favourite player was Michael Jordan! I would like to know more information about clothes and money. Do I need to take a special clothes such as, warn clothes, jumper. Finally, How much money to I need to take with me? Is there any cash machines nearest where we  staying? It would be very grateful for you  to give me more details as soon as possible. I  looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely, Alak Liyana  [SEP]  Dear, Kim, How are you? I haven't heard from you for such a long time. I hope everything is alright with you. Sorry! I haven't written to you since  last two months, because I have been very busy to helped and organizing the pop concert which took place near my town. Let me tell you more about what I have done last month. I have had a wonderful experienced with helping  pop concert last month. My duty was helped them cooking for all of them during the concert, as you know I'm very good at cook and everybody loved my good I cooked! Secondly, I helped them to prepared the clothes and the custom during the concert, although I never experience about clothes and art before, but I enjoyed it very much. What I liked most about my experienced from the concert was a great atmosphere behind the state and  live music  made me felt great and happy, what's more, I have  opportunity to meet a singer who I loved and I dream about. He also gave me his adress and telephone number if I need help from him in the future. I'll show you when you come around to see me. Anyway, I'd better go now. I have some homework that needs to be done. Write to me soon when you have time. Give my regards to our parents. Take care! Best wishes, ",27.0
418," Dear sir, I bought a ticket for the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show last Saturday, but I felt very disappointed with it. It was announced that there would be discount tickets available, but there were not. The show should have started at 19.30, but it  delayed forty-five minutes. And, the worst of all: Danny Brook was not on stage. He was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance. Last, the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a tube and the kitchen was flooded. I think there are sufficient reasons for   money back. I just wanted to have a pleasant evening out and I could ever imagine that there would be so many troubles. I really expect that you  consider my arguments and cash me back the value of the ticket, as soon as possible. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Several technological advances in the past five years have changed my daily life. Nowadays, I feel myself entirely linked to these innovations, and I would find it hard to live without them.  Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations. Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, that would take a much longer time  to be found by traditional means. For a shy person, like me,  Internet has another attractive: the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide. It's very exciting. Currently, I exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country. Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car is broken  on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth. Modern technology granted other facilities: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait on a big queue to be attended by the cashman, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.

I would like to travel to  camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you. I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel. About accommodation, I think tents would be great. Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children. Basketball will help  children to build team character and leadership . And swimming is very good for  health. I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player. I count on my experience. And there are  few questions I would like to ask.

It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favorite band. And what do you think I answered? Of course, yes! I have got very responsible work I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders. Can you imagine? I came into their room and give hot Cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter. It was the happiest moment of my life. He asked me was the cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was. I was very nervous talking with him. He told me about  concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign. I will never forget that summer day. It was my day, I am sure about it. Well, I think that is all. See you.

I would like to travel on July because I will be on  winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school. I would really prefer to stay in  tents because I love sleeping outdoors and listening   noises from outside. I am going to tell you two activities that I would like to do while I will be at the Camp. Firstly I would be happy if you let me play tennis, because I have played it for four years and I do it well, and secondly I believe that singing could be interesting because I really like it and I have a beautiful voice.

I'm writing because I know that you're interested in listening  my experience in which I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, perhaps in the future you'll be able to help too. If you want to help at a pop concert you'll have to write down yourself in a competition as I did, then, if you win the organiser will phone you and you'll be able to help them. At the concert I had to clear and organized all the people who were in, but at the end of the night I was able to talk with one of my favourite pop singer.

441," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Firstly, the actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Danny Brook did not appear in the show, it was another actor. This was really disappointing. Secondly, the show was really late . It started at 20.15, not at 19.30 as it was supposed to be. And, although you have promised  in your advertisement, there were no discounts available. To make things worst, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show in that date. To sum up, it was not a perfect evening out. And, I would appreciate  if you give me a refund. I look forward to hear from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, funny and confortable. I think that we will not use formal clothes anymore. People will prefer to use confortable clothes, even to go to the office. The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more funny. We will not use black clothes as we are used to do. People will use yellow, pink and green clothes. This way, people tend to be happier. However, the clothes will not be as  teenagers use to wear nowadays to go to ""raves"". It will be more beautiful and clean. Mainly, people will not be so fashionable as they are nowadays. They will wear a  clothe only if they feel good wearing it. Actually, I think that the clothes will be really simplier in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then. ",27.0
995," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and I'm writing back to tell you how much it made me happy to win this prize and to give you the answers to your questions. I would like to travel in July because I can only see my family during the month of August. Concerning the accomodation, I prefer to live in log cabins finding them much more comfortable than tents! Finally, I decided to choose singing and basketball because my friends say I'm good at both. Singing has always been a hobby and takes an important part in my life. Singing relaxes me when I am stressed before exams or competitions. Basketball is simply my favourite sport. It makes me feel very free and makes me forget all my daily problems. I actually have won a basketball prize when I was young...! to finish off, I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping  and what kind of clothes I should take. I hope I haven't been too ""demanding"". Yours sincerely, Marthe Ouellet  [SEP]  Making a short video about daily life is an enjoyable but difficult thing to do. We would concentrate on students imagination, creation and talent. to do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes. Effectively, in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes. However, it is important to observe students attention and therefore we should film them during an exam (but only for a short period of time) A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that short shots should be taken for each subject. Students walking and talking in corridors should be filmed so that we also show how students relax between two lessons. I think these are the best advices I can give and hope that one understands the main idea which is to concentrate more on students attitudes than on lessons. ",31.0
984," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to inform you about your question. At first, I would like to go travel on July, because before them I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my study. Secondly, I want to stay in  log cabin. I think it is more convenient than in tents. And I would like to have a chance about  painting and photography. I am not so fit and well condition, so I don't like to do activitily. However, to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are  very good experience for me. I hope so  much. Thank you for your invitation. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Do you like the shopping? Generally many women would like the shopping include me. Even the young girl wants to go shopping with mum. However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping? Perhaps you have an experience unpleased. You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover  you bought something then you could find it is a little bit  expensive than the other shop. Both cases are often happened in shopping. If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping. Then you should check the price and the quality of the good. If you remember these two things at least, you could enjoy the shopping. One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are going only a window shopping. ",20.0

The reasons I am really writing, However, is to give you some details of my trip to California. I'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it's the only month I can spend abroad this year. In the letter you said that  accommodation provided can be either  tents or  log cabins. I would prefer to stay in  tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .

This is just to let you know with whom I worked. In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city, the Coun Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band ""Five"" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also   the stages and  sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe  when he said: ""O.K. if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do."" My job was to leave some leaflets on shops, restaurants and  streets. Working with this band was an experience I will never forget. What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff. Although I was too nervious, I knew I could do the job well. I'd love to hear all your news, why don't you come and visit me? Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Love from, ",36.0
1193," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday. I do welcome you and your group, and I am willing to help you by giving the informations that you have asked me . Firstly, let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference. The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there  many ways to get to the conference. The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes. The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel's Percel Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening. Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech, and after that dinner will be served. The party is not very formal, so you can wear any kind of dress, as long as it is suitable for dinner. Finally, I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day's free time. It must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere. It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing. I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information. I look forward to seeing you soon, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  . Report on Kyoung Bok Palace - the Glory of Chosun Kingdom. . Introduction . This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace, which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries. It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples, and makes a final recommendation. . History . The kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of  20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size. As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army. . Activity . The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tends to dislike the historical visit, would be the various activity. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace. . Final Recommendation . It is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history. You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea. ",37.00
615," Dear Helen Ryan; Thank you very much for your letter and for this competition. First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available on July, is it fine for you? Because, the only time I can take  holiday is July. I would prefer log cabins, I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents. About the two activities I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming courses for four years. And the reason I choose painting is it's being very exciting to me, I am not very good at this subject but I would improve my painting. I would like to ask whather you have competitions or different activities? Do you reccomend me to take only summer clothes or some winter clothes as well? Is it  very expensive area? I mean would £700 be enough for me for one week? Thank you very much for your interest I look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, It's been a long time not to write to you, I'm really sorry but I was very busy. I worked untill midnight everyday. Actually I don't work, you know, I had been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert. It was very important for us because we really wanted people to enjoy it. It was very enjoyable I met lots of friends We'd been together all day, painting the walls, cleaning  putting  some baloons and other staff everywhere. And at the time of  concert we wore a big funny costume, and danced with people. Everybody liked it very much, Anyway we worked for that. The most I like was meeting with the band. Guess what the name of the band is; Back Street Boys. Oh, my God they're so nice, talkative, funny, people. But you know they're a bit spoilt. I have to finish or I'll miss the last post. Bye for now, write to me soon love, ",31.0
333," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement of The Circle theater said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there. First of all, the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I don't have the chance to enjoy his excellent performance. Another actor standed  for him, without any advice. Another thing was the confirmed hour of the show which it started forty-five minutes later without any factual reason . In addition to all this, there was no discount in the price of the tickets, for students either, contrary to what I was told by  phone when I asked for more information. Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theater's restaurant. But for our surprise, it was out of order. At the end of all these circumstances we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint. So, due to the things I have mentioned, I think I shoul be given some money back. I look forward to recieving  information from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  ""How has modern technology changed your daily life?"" Owing to the great speed of technological development, people need to lead a faster life. When this technological aspect changes so quickly, I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields. I would say that the worst thing of this development for me is that more and more I experience stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is no enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life passes devoted in my duties without  time to pleasures. Apart from this, another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities, being able to breath fresh air several days a month when we go to the country. In addition to this, there is less comunication between members of my family, because when we arrive at home after an exhausted day racing with the time, the only thing we want to do is lying in the sofa while watching television. Apart from this, computer's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to, while five years ago when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters which was a slower way to contact with people. On the other hand and as a conclusion, I think that this development has made my life more comfortable living sourrended by lots of gadgets with differents functions. ",31.0
345," Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see your musical show called 'Over the rainbow'. It was actually very disappointing and I have to say that I want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and I rally do think it was not the perfect evening out. Here are the problems of your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late. The price of  ticket was another problem. Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available. I did not get  discount. I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show. I really do think you need to organise your show a bit more carefully so you do not make these mistakes in future and it will be kind of you if you give my money back. Yours faithfully Ring T Lun  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I believe that modern technology has changed a lot of people's daily life. My daily life also got affected by modern technology a lot. The modern technology which changed my daily life most is a personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course works in the computer. The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations in  shorter time. I can go on  internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones. I don't have to go to  library and read hundred's of books to find informations anymore. I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses and I don't have to go to football pitches to see how the players are playing. There are, of course some disadvantages. Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology. I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere. There are plenty of trains and buses. I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit. I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot. I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more. ",29.0
1162," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you very much for your letter. I would be very pleased if I can help you answering all your enquiries. The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would suggested you to walk along New Street, which is the one next to  river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel in your right hand side. The hotel is just opposite to the City Hospital. As you already possibly know, the end-of-conference party will take place at the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. Answering your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all. With reference to the last afternoon, if I were you I would visit the City Museum. There are many interesting works of art by famous painters of this country. If you have any time left you ought to go to the High Street, where you could go shopping. Please, do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information. I look forward to meeting you at the Conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES! The invention without no doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car. Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not refering only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well. Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets. Could you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people nervous,  sometimes really upset and violent. But, anyway, people use cars. If we don't use them we suffer from them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle. Isn't that contradictorious? To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh, non-polluted air, I use my car, which, as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all. Therefore I am thinking in selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places, and change my life for a new life: whithout  car.

44," International Arts Festival Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you for your advertisement for the festival. I am  student at London College and studying English. I have always been interesed arts and festivals. It was great that you organised  Art Festival in this City, because people realy needed this kind of sochibal activities here. I have spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friend and I must say we  realy delighted, it was  great idea to do that in London. We all liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts. However  concert halls were too small and lots of people couldn't get in to  concert halls and there were only six countries stars and artists. I believe  plays and films should be more than it was for next year and  stars and artists should be from round the world. One reasonably priced weeker ticket for all events was excellent because its alway busy for the weekend and people prefer to go any week day. I hope, you will concider about my opinions and  my suggestions would be helpful for the next year. Look forward to hearing from you. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Freddie I received your letter just this morning. It was very nice to hearing from you. We never like rules, do we? However there are lots of rules in our lives, both at home and at school. In my countries school we are not allowed to have an argument with class-mates and  not allowed to eat at class. We can't listen  music at class as well. We alway have to keep clean every where, but this kind of rules are not very strict I believe. At home  is completely different, my mum is quite organised, so she always puts new rules. Firstly I've to keep clean my room and hoover once a week. I've to cook myself and  worst thing is I'm not allowed to listen  loud music in everywhere at home. I'm not allowed to stay out after midnight. When I groue up I'll change all  rules in my life and I'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict. Love to hearing from you soon. Love ",25.00
313," Dear manager, During my stay in London, I visited all the most famous place and I enjoyed  a lot during this days. I love London's musical shows and I read the advertisement for the show called ""over the rainbow"". I've gone to many musical shows where the main actor was Danny Brook and I can say that he is really good. It was my last night in London and I decided to go to this musical show. When I asked for the price I was surprised becaused the seller told  there wasn't any discount available. I showed the advertisement to him and he said it was wrong and I paid the normal price. I bought the ticket for the second session and I went to the theatre at seven o'clock. I had been waiting half an hour outside the theatre and finally it started at a quarter past eight. I was angry about all of this problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong with the actor's name. When the musical show finished I went to the theatre's restaurant and it was closed because it was too late, so I couldn't have dinner there, as it was announced . I wasn't a good evening and I would like to have my money back. Waiting for your answer.  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life and I'll try to explain it. We have been using personal computers for nine years and it's one of the most important changes. Last year I spent ten hours looking for information for my homework. The subject was ""What's happening in Irak?"" I started my research in the town's library and all the information I collected was from a local newspaper. After two hours I thought that all of this information was writted from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion. I used my computer for collecting reports from  internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analize it in two weeks. Internet has changed our daily life: you can find whatever you want. Do you want to have a different lunch? Do you want to organize a different holiday in a strange place? You can find there all you need and more! I can't imagine my parents playing in the street without watching the TV. I couldn't life without modern music. I'm not interested in films without special effects.. And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop it's caming  the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake in a corner's machine without any coin, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more... ",30.0
1028," Dear Mr Robertson In the name of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a galery. However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. It is a famous exhibition, where are showed  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life. It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country. Could it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping time and to replace them by the London Show? We may go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of  the afternoon  free time. I hope you will consider my request. I'am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  My dream It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks. I lived in a small village on the ocean. My father was a captain on a huge boat. When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbours to harbours. I grew up through the water world and I couldn't live whitout it. Once I was fishing, when sharks came all around me. I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them. Since this famous experience, I dreamt every night about that. One Saturday I got on my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks. I had done what I had never expected to do. Now I can die in freedom. ",28.00
519," Dear Sir, I'm writing in order to make you know how angry I am for having gone to one of your shows. I went to London for a week's holiday with some friends and every evening we decided something to do in order to enjoy our staying in that beautiful city. I wish we had never chosen your show. In fact, only after having going into the theatre, I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show. First of all, when I paid  my ticket I noticed that nobody could obtain the discount you'd written about. But that would be nothing if I thought to dinner I had to cancelled because your show started at 20.15, although it should have been at 19.30! Besides, when we decided to spend the evening in the theatre restaurant, we were informed that it was closed because the chef was ill. At that point, even if there had been Danny Brook as the advertisement announced, it wouldn't have been a less disappointing evening. According to all these things, I ask  my money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but I realized it only when it was too late. What have moved me to this discover were the facts that happened last month. I had just quarreled with Jon, who is my fiance. In that period we weren't getting on with . So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking at the consequences. And there would have been no problems if I hadn't talked to Pat about that evening. It was only a dinner with a friend and in fact we'd spent all the time remembering our childhood, but probably Pat can have thought that Peter and I weren't only friends. So she ran to Jon in order to make him know  the terrible mistake I had made that evening. He became very angry no matter how hard I tried telling him the truth. By the way, I've understood I had better trust in nobody. ",28.0
213," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to complain about my unpleasant experience of visiting your theatre on May 21st. I had dreamt about visiting the Circle Theatre to see Danny Brook's performance for a long time. As soon as I saw your advertisement in the 'Tourist Guide' issue 46, I decided to go at once. However, all my expectations failed to become true. First of all, I found that no discounts for tickets were available. Although you mentioned it in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the starting they announced that Danny Brook woud not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor. After the show I was not surpised at all to know that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration. As a whole, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get. In connection with that I ask you to refund the money I paid for my tickets. I really hope it will not take you long to settle the matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Undoubtfully, modern technology changed my daily life. And the best word I can  describe all the changes with is ""drastical"". Every aspect of my life is being constantly influence by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc. Among the greatest inventions of man I came accross dayly are  telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of a day I may contact any person at any part of the world over  phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousand  kilometres'  from me. Computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet, to make shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. Automobile saves my time when I'm travelling. All the above and many other achievements of modern technology make my life more convenient, comfortable, effective and fun. But it is not the end. Scientists continue researches into new technologies, such as lasers, digital technology,  gene engineering. And I'm sure all those will set new better standards for my way of living. ",28.0
422," Dear Sir or Madam, Ref: Over the rainbow musical show. I am writing to you to mention some problems about the musical show shown in your theatre. First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show, it wasn't. Because I'm big fan of them, if was pretty much boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing. It didn't start at 19:30 and there was a delay for 45 minutes which was quite a long time and everyone got frustrated. The tickets also caused a problem. Discounts weren't available at all. Moreover the testament was till under the construction so that we couldn't use it when we were extlemely hungry. Finally, I wonder why you didn't ask for the money back if you have guaranteed the perfect evening. I am therefore writing to you to ask for the money back as I didn't get any advantages or services from you. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, L. P. Lou  [SEP]  Technology has been developed extremely fast these days and as it is still going on, it can't help affecting our lives. One of the biggist thing  has changed is a change in a method of communications. People have invented such things like TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us enable to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily. There are also changes in biological areas. Nearly almost of the disease have been found the way to cure except only a few like AIDS. It helped us to live longer and make us stronger against them. I have mentioned  few changes above but there's still a biggist one left which is about computer areas. It helped us to be able to work much more quicker and accurately than before with the help of  Internet. Basically modern technology has changed our life more comfortably but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship, togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for  whole day. But we still have to admit that we can't live without them even  they give us some disadvantages. ",24.0

I would like to travel in the middle of July because my summer holiday starts in the middle of July. Is it possible to travel in July? And also I like to camp in a tent, because it will be more interesting than log cabins. You need to do everything by yourself. Taking a photography during the holiday is  very good memory for me, and I can share my adventures to my friends. So while I am at the Camp I like to take many photographies and climb a mountain. Fresh-air, flowers and meeting some interesting people while you are climbing you have. By the way, I wonder if I need a lot of money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Finally, thanks for giving this opportunity to me I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely 13/06/00  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Shopping sounds very enjobleable and  fantastic for women. You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected. Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes. Nowadays in a family shopping isn't  women's job. In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things. It will be very awful. However, shopping has pros and cons, it depends on personal thinking. I enjoy shopping very much, it can let me know what's going on in the world. But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping ,  you won't feel so tired. ",24.0
449," Santigo, June 17th, 2000 Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre, While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the add on the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was. One of the reason I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor announced in the add,  Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with forty five minutes delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The add also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason! It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket prize, it is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for. Looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  We can hardly imagine life without compures, T.V. sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than  our parents , thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of.  Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our life will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our life easier, technology is welcome. ",32.0

I would like to travel in July because, I will be working for the rest of the summer. I would like to stay in a log cabin, since I can't sleep in tiny, narrow areas. I have been sailing in the Mediterennean for eight years and I have been playing tennis for four years so I would like to choose sailing and tennis  activities. I would like to ask you  the sort of the clothes I am supposed bring. I know that I will need sports equipment such as; tennis shoes, a few sport shirts and shorts. Also deck shoes and a waterproof jacket for sailing; but besides that will I need any thing else? What's my fund limit? I would really appreciate  if you could write me back. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I received your letter. I do not want to keep you curious any longer. The oppurnity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance. I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert. I, ofcourse jumped into it. The idea of meeting a worldwide known pop singer; just made my heart punch my ribcage. The concert  was all ready filled up with thousands  , although it was really early. We, the volunteers first unravelled the cables,  set  the microphones and some instruments. Then we, were told go to the back stage and make sure everything was perfect. After a fantastic concert I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears. She is a very nice person I managed to scavange an authograph for you as well I will put it in the envelope. Waiting to hear from you Take here! Melina ",33.0
245," Dear Manager: When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very exited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving, it becomed the best oportunity I ever had to asist to a musical of that category, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writting to you. Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not , which was very disappointing because, the actors were starring  the musical, was one of it mayor attractions. Another point that I want to comply about, is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy, and  not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats. In consequence of the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important  to me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best. Hope to hear from you:  [SEP]  Science and Technology is a theme very  discussed nowdays, most of the comunity of our city, and of the world, were technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life. And I think it's the same to me, because when advances in technology like computers, internet, etc. were made, it changed my life as a high school student. Answering the question: ""How has modern technology changed my daily life?, I can confirm, that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the internet, because it was easiest to me, and to every one, to make your home works, school works, and in fact, it was easier to me to search for information that in the past I would have to look at in a library. But not all about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, had become computer's an thechnologic's slaves, and we can not do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make easier our daily tasks, but we have to mantain our independence as humans. Technology, in fact it has made an improvement on daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brain will become atrophied. ",23.0
50," Mrs. Jane Clark, I see your advertisement about  Internal Arts Festival now. I think that's a great idea. As we need some good activities.  Advertisement is written that you invite stars and artist from around the world. This is very incredible but from only six countries you wrote. I think you should invite  from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world. If you invite from more countries to stars and artist, your festival will be unbelieved.  Second point is there are some jazz, rock and classical concerts. It's a good idea but some concert halls are too small. Because of these, people are bored quickly. You show plays and films. I congradulate you because it's perfect. The most important thing is dance shows. As more people like dance shows, me too. That's the real knowledge for us, art exhibition and talks by writers. I think we know a writer life or how is he writing  it? it's  very significant thing. Lastly, you said 'one reasonable-priced weekend ticket for all events'. It's excellent. If you can pay attention to my small suggestion, next year I hope it will be  unbelievable festival. THANKS! Yours sincerely!  [SEP]  Dear Edmond I miss you very much and sorry about  didn't write you some letters. I hope you forgive me. What are you dong today, how is your school? My school opened yesterday. As you know I am a new student. It is very difficult because I don't know anybody. However; today I  used to my school, I have got two sweet girls. But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class, we have been talking about Rules, both at home and at school. It is very boring. For instance; you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers. The most significant rule is you must not smoke in public places, or in the toilet. You continuously must study hard. I feel very bad because what you are allowed I aren't allowed to do at home. Are you understand me? Can I change my school? Please you will write me a letter quickly. Lovers! ",17.00
1014," Dear Mr Robertson, On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show, that we saw advertised and we are interested  indeed. In addition we would like to thank you about the programme. Firstly, I would like to give you some details about this show. It will take place in  Central Exhibition Hall, in London, on Tuesday  14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00 I would like to mention that  this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping. Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly  what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do! I look forward to your reply, Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Some people think that to be a famous person is  very excuiting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well. I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory  must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important  is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have  bad reputation, and they will be not  trustworthy. Another succesfull carreer such as, film stars must also be balanced. If somebody is a film star this mean that  has got a different kind of life,  more comfortable, more interesting  but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star. If somebody wants to be famous of cource  must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself. And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people. ",23.00
88," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show. We had a very disappointing evening yesterday. We thought that we would like to let you know all  details  which it didn't make us happy. First of all, we went to the theather to pick up our tickets. We were thinking  to get some discount on our tickets, because we had already read  from the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay  complete money for the show. We were ready for the show at 19.30. We sat  out sits and waited for the show but it didn't come out on time, it started at 20.15 which was  redicoulus time. We waited for 45 minutes. Secondly, when the show started, I was looking for Danny Brook, because this actor was the most important reason for me to come here. I realised that it was  different actor playing instead of Danny brook. I was very disappointed. After  show we went immediately to the tickets office for asking   money back, but they were to strict and close-minded. They just said, ""we don't give money back."" However we wanted to eat something at the Theatre Restaurant, but it was again  same with the others, because the restaurant was closed. Finally, we had a totally unhappy night with your show. You can't take this bad feeling back but you might give us our money back. This would be the first good memory for us  from your show. We look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe  [SEP]  People, who lives in the city, use lots of technological stuff. They make their life style much easy  more fast because they need to catch up with the other people. In the twenty first century things are changing very fast. If we look at a family life. They have typical this time life style. Children have  own televisions, computers and telephones in their room. Mother and Father have  own cars and mobile phones. Sometimes even the children have  own mobile phone as well. Full of technological tools and instruments in the house. Fire alarm, burglar alarm, house temperature checker, automatic garage door many of them. They use all of this because they want to do their work, and leisure activities with this helping kits. In the other hand, thy use all this too much. For example a mobile phone; People talk with it on the street, in the car almost everywhere. Some of them necessiraly some of them not. Just wersting time on it. They don't even think how they take the communication lines are busy, how many people  on the phone at  same time. Too many Anyway technology is the most important thing for our life. It developes day by day. The problem is ""Do we really use it properly or not?"" ",26.0
321," Dear Mister, I am writing from Paris where I live. My wife an I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago. We were really pleased because it was our first time in England. We asked our travel agent to organise our trip. My wife and I are both found of theatre, musical shows especially. It is so rare to see musical in Paris that we decided to book two seats for ""Over the rainbow"". We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly in the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 each seat. The worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really need singing lessons). After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. Perhaps it was a  luck! So we want you to give us our money back, the show didn't worth the price. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  And now, I was wondering if I had not made a mistake. My brother was too talkative! Two days before, I told him that our father was about to buy a brand new car. And he did not want our mother to be informed. It was supposed to be a gift for twenty years of marriage. A car only for her. The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret. And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing. Her reaction was not the one we were expecting. Apparently she was not surprised, but she was surely angry. Really angry!! She thought it was a stupid idea, and also an expensive one. According to her, this car would have been useless. She suspected our father to want to please himself. Then, we decided to offer her a red bicycle. It was the colour my father had chosen for the car! ",30.0

Firstly, I am afraid that I am just available to travel only in July because it is difficult to get my own holiday from my work a the moment. I prefer staying in tents to log cabins because I have really been interested in making tents and staying  there. Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose Basket ball and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends from these kinds of sports. Both could be exciting for me. I would like to know more about clothes and money. I have got not idea about them. I would be grateful if you could send me some information of them. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. Yours faithfully, KANG OFF WOO  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am happy to write a letter to you. What I really want to say is about my recent experience. Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just  as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I ever seen on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music which were so cool. After the concert I had got an opportunity to join them to the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to control their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them. Especially, Mike who is a member of Metal Potato told me I had got a talent  to play the electric guitar. It is impossible to explain all my experience without this word, ""Brilliant!!!"". I would like to invite you to their next concert and share my experience with you. Please let me know if you want to come as soon as possible. Best wishes, KANG OFF WOO ",32.0
869," June 13, 2000 Competition. Organiser Helen Ryan Dear Madam: I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my tests. I will do  F.C.E in  University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school. I prefer my accommodation at Camp in tents because it reminds me  my first school. It was great. But the way, I do not like to stay alone. I would like to have lots of people near me. Among those activities that you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes about them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is my challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it. I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend. I want to know if I can take my celular phone, too. Sincerely MARGARET BORNETE GOODS  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Women love shopping. I am a woman then I love it a lot. All weekends I and my boyfriend go to  B.H Shopping Center. I live in Site Belo and he lives near  B.H. Shopping Center. I retired four years ago and my live is very bored. When I am very sad I like to buy something and sometimes it makes me happy. I bought a lot of shoes, clothes and books last week. He was with me and suddenly he became very angry. He told me that I was very stupid. I tried to buy a handsome suit for him but he shouted and abandoned me with my bags. I took a cab and went to my house. I cried very much because my life is really very stupid. I decided to stop buying those things that I don't really need. I intend to continue studying and return to work because when our life is empty everything looks ugly and sad. I know in deep of my heart sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. But I am a woman. We are different. We need different things than men. Yesterday he called me and told me that he loves me, anyway. I believe him because he is a great man. I hope that he forgets  my shopping. And I decided I will go shopping alone. At last I am really a great woman and I love myself. ",30.0

More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any discounts. I had to pay full prise. I was promised that after  show I could go to  theatre restaurant but due to  started late we aslo finished late therefore, when I went to the restaurant they were deffinately closed.

I paid for the show £ 50.00 I also have a recite to prove it. I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Phukana Najee  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I have a really good, freind, Pat who I was trusted and counted on her. I have know her for five years. and we were love each other very much. One day, I was falling in love with  closest freind. I went out with him sometimes and we were happy. My boy freind was very handsome, clever and very polite. We were stedy at the same class at school and he also knowed Pat as well. Personally, I wanted to keep  serets because I  afraid that we might have splited up. And I would like to make sure that he was relly love me. My boy freind told me that he wanted to surprise his freind in his class when the times comes. To be honest, I wanted to share this felling to someone else but I needed to keep  very secret. I felt unhappy sometimes. One day I decided to tell my best freind - Pat who I realio-on her.

In this letter you ask me  some further information for my conveniance for this trip. Firstly, I can take my holiday only  the two first week of july because of my work. Secondly, I would prefer sleep in a tent. I am going every year camping in the countryside of France. The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing. I have never sailed but I am a well swimmer. Last summer I took a course of one week in Switzerland of climbing so I have good knowledge of this sport. Finally could you please tell me wich kind of clothes shall I take with me and if the camping furnitures are provided. I  also wondering me how much money I need and if there is a safe place where I can put my money and passport. I look forward to earing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful. Yours sincerely Laura Demoriane  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on saturday because for lots of people they don't go to work  and  is the only day off of the majority of people. If you don't get up enough early you can't find a parking  in the town centre, all of them are full before 11 am. In the street is so crowded that you can't walk like usually and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lost them. In the shops is worth, if you are lucky and you find a clothes with your right size you will wait 20 min. at the fitting room and after that 20 min more at the cash desk. In the supermarket  is the same. When you buy food or drink they give you  plastic bag for carry it  and this bags broke every time. At the end of the month when your husband will receive the bill from you visa card he will have an heart-attack! Why not buy with  internet or if you have a nice mother at home enjoy this time because shopping is like go in the jungle. ",24.0
59," Dear Ms Jane Clark I am writing to you because I have some suggestion about next year festival, and if it is possible I can give you some opinions about this year festival. Firstly, in your advertisement  states: stars and artist from around the world, and this year  one only from six countries It would be great if there was more artist  not only six. Secondly, the concerts are fantastic, especially  rock concerts. I very enjoy on it, but some of the halls are too small. I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied. Another thing,  plays and films. I saw only 2 plays and 3 films. For me it is too little. One of the reasons that I have visited your art festival was to saw a lot of plays In  future I supposed to be an actress and that's way I want to learn something from  professionalists. I hoe that next year I will. The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have  weekend-price. This is  excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it by  whole family at the weekend and see all events in  reasonaby-price I believe that you consider my opinions. If you can't consider all of then, I would like only one: more and once more plays! Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Annabel Thank you for your letter, and I'm sorry I didn't write. I have examinations, but now I have plenty of time and I can write a letter to you. In your letter you ask me about  rules in school and home I have. I think that they are the same as yours, but I'm not sure at 100 per cent so I vrite :  Rules at school are: we must be on time at lessons,   always have make  homework. Everybody must be present at lessons. If someone is ill  must bring a paper from a doctor. And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to  teachers At home I must clean my room and vacuuming  home. I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows. I like clean my home, and I like  when there is clean and fresh. However I'm the only child and I don't have do too much but I want  and I like it. There is one thing I like to change,  the treatment students  by teachers. They want too much forstudent and are unkindly for them. That's all, I hope that I give you answers for all  questions you have. Give my best wishes to your family Bye ",23.00
940," Dear Helen Ryan: My name is Julia Sanches and I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writing to tell you the information you have asked  about me: I would like to travel on July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes. About the activities, I would like to do Basketball and Surfing. I play Basketball at school twice a week and I enjoy it. Although I do not play perfectly, I play quite well, but I would still like to practice. I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice oportunity to practice surfing too. There are some things I would like to ask : the tipe (and quantity) of Clothes I will have to take,  if it is necessary to take some money and any additional stuff (like raincoates). Well, that would be all. I look forward to receiving your letter. Yours sincerely, Julia Sanches  [SEP]  IS EVIL INTERESTING? Since we are kids people tell us stories with two sides in conflit: the good and the bad side. The good always wins, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting? On the tale ""It's a good life"", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and uningative. He controls the other people using the power of his mind. Although the other people on the story are the good ones and suffer with his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told  us by the author. In conclusion, even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad, sometimes the good ones are quite boring, and we find the bad one much more interesting. ",29.0

1206," Dear Mrs Smith, I am writing to you to give you more informations about an international student conference. The group has been booked into  King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is  following the rod in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called  White House. At the end of  conference, we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college. As this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country. Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or  do some shopping at High Street. If you want more information, please contact me and I am looking forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Mr. Bill, I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit. It is called Penrhyh Castle, as the building will tell you all about Wales. On the positive side, you and the group will be abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall, on the door and some furnitures. The building itself looks splendid and beautiful. On the other hand, you might find something which is very boring such as walking along the old wooden floor which causes some noise. And some old toilets might look awlful. But in my recommendation, I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building. Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country. As Wales is not modern like America, so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things.

707," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you very much for your letter. I was very glad to hear that I had won first prize in the competition. Anyway, to participate in two-weeks  Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information. First of all, the most favorable time for me to travel is July, because I am in the final year of University, so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July, when I can take a relatively long summer holiday. Second of all, I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents, since I have had a horrible experience being attaked by a herd of midges, when I camped out. Additionally, I am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay. I would willingly like to choose swimming and painting. I used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week. I have also gone in for some competitions. Painting is one of my hobbies as well, although I do not specialise in it or anything. I'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of California. Last but not at least, what sort of clothes do you think I must bring with me, and is there any laundry system there? Also should I take some money just in case? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, and I would be very grateful for your help. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Introduction The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department's investigation. Lessons According to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like Maths. Consequently it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of  English department. Extra activities It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed. Conclusion To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life. It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of. ",37.0
212," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show, which I have seen in The Circle Theatre on 6th June. On that date, I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in  musial show. But things started to go wrong from the beginning. The first problem was the price of tickets. I expected to buy  ticket cheaply but no discounts were available. Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late. I found the theater rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row. Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time. However, something wrong came up again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brocher, did not play a part in the show. And I  really disappointed from the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after  show, but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior. I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from  advertisement. I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund. I expect to receive a cheque for £20.  look forward to hearing soon. Yours faithfully    [SEP]  It's comletely different! Have you ever been to  fashion show named ""New trend, New Millenium""? 'It's completely different! How can we go our wearing thouse clothes?' This is what my friend said the other day when she went to see the show with me. These days, new designs and new trends are coming out every day, sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days  we were young. However, It doesn't seem to take long for most of young people to get used to it, so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future. In my opinion, I believe that clothes indicate  individual's creativity as well as social situation. We never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age. On the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefre to wear nothing. Let's face it. Clothes are always changing. But the question no one  answer is what is  fashion in 100 year's time?  ",30.0

As far as accomodtion is concerned, I would like to live in  tents at Camp California. I prefer this type of accomodation because I am used to living in tents during my summer holidays.

I had to look after people near the stage. The organiser gave me a radio and I had to advise the other staff members in case of  disorder. At the same time I could enjoy the music! I think this is what I particularly liked about this experience. I suggest you to try this kind of experience. You should be pride of you helping people who suffers, and at the same time you may enjoy yourself! I am looking forward to seeing you! Love ",32.0
419," Dear Sir/Madam I am writing to express how I was dissatisfied with OVER THE RAINBOW which was presented by the Circle Theatre. First of all, the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook, who is my favorite star, and was going to play for the show. However, there was a different actor instead of him, and this was most my disappointment. Moreover, as your advertisement, we would get  discount price for the ticket, but it was not available. Although the show was supposed to start at 19=30, it started at 20=15, so I had to wait for an hour. To make matters worse, because of the late starting, the theatre restaurant had already closed after the show finished. I wonder if you could give me a refund for that, because the show was extremely different  which I was expected. I hope you would take immediate action for that. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. Yours faithfuly  [SEP]  Our daily life with modern technology Science and technology are necessary for our life. I could say that we can not servive without them. Nowadays,  especially computer technology is improving, therefore, we can get any kinds of information as much as we require. It is getting more convinient and useful than our past life. Further more, it is possible to cure many patients who have serious desease more effectively, if we use modern technology for medical science. However, if we rely on modern technology too much, it is difficult to be independent, otherwise we will tend to not consider or solve a problem by ourselves. From my point of view, it is great that science and technology improve for our life. Because of convinience, we can spend  time more effectively, but we should not be rely on these  too much. ",25.0
1167," Dear Mrs Smith, I am applying  your letter where  you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College. Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is situated in the city center, at 15 minutes walking from where the conference take place in. In the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College. The conference will start at 7 p.m, the same day we expect, the 18th of June. Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks, drinks and music. For the people  interested in , there will be also an amusement karaoke. Everybody should wear formal clothes, at least, a little bit formal. No jeans and tee-shirts. There is a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough. We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the river side, which is the best if it is a nice day, sunny an warm, for take a walk. For any details look in the next page map. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Alice knew that is was going to be a very special day for her. She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special. So, she took the bus, like every morning, and she went to school. But that day was a little bit different: she had her maths exam. She had never passed an maths exam and she was really nervous. Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea. She sat down and what a surprise she found a lottery ticket. Nobody was around her, so she took the ticket. Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place. She did the exam really well, she was very surprised, and after the exam she went home. She spend the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock. At the time, she turned on the TV and while the lottery's man was shouting  the winning numbers, she checked hers and what was the surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same!! She win £500!!!

1056," Dear Mr Robertson, You may be surprised to receive a letter from us. All the students are happy that we will have othe oppurtinatey, to visit London for three days. This trip would gives us the change to see London and to improve the english language. We all agree to the daily programme during the three days. In the morning, we will have the change, to see some of the sightseeings of London by bus, For example the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery. In the afternoon, the River trip to Greenwich would also be a fantastic experience for us. The reason I write to you, is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, for a fiew days. It would be exciting, if we had the possibility, to go to the show. The show includes the latest fashions in the sports clothing and the most fashionable make up and hairstyles. We all think that the London fashion and Leisure show will be a great opportunity for us. The show is free for students and we can see the show instat of having free time  Wednesday in the afternoon. We all thank you for your help. We send you our regards. The student  [SEP]  Ourdays, with the help of the media famous people, like a politician or filmstars, plays an important rule in our community. It is also normally,  that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially from their private . Who got married, who got divorsed or who had a remarkeable changing of his complexion, these are questions, who most journalists are interested in. But what  life is it, when you even can't go to a restaurant  being afraid of, the journalists,  will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people diserve also to have a private life. It is a right like everybody from us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. Is it normally when you are a star, that everybody wants to know all about you. We shoudn't forget, that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media! I think nobody have forgotten, where  curiosity from the journalists end. For example  the hunting about Princess Diana and his friend. I hope that they will  punished for what they done! ",25.00
138," 17/06/00 mr. MANAGER MY NAME  JAMES CAMIREZ AND I'AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLEINTS FOR THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT. FIRST OF ALL ON THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAYS THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM  WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT, IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING! SECOND I GOT TO THE THEATRE AT 19.20 BECAUSE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE SHOW STARTS AT 19.30, AND I GOT HEAVILY MAD WHEN I LOOK  MY WATCH AND NOTICE THAT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 40 (FORTY) MINUTES AND THE SHOW DIDN'T START YET...I MEAN I WAS AMAIZING! THEN I READ ON THE ADVERTISEMENT, DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE, AND I DIDN'T GOT ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM. AFTER THE SHOW I GOT OUT  THE SHOW ROOM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED AND WENT TO THE RESTAURANT TO DRINK SOMETHING TO RELAX, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?.. IT WAS CLOSED! I COULDN'T BELIVE IT HOW THIS CLASS OF THEATRE CAN BE SO .. OH I'M GETING MAD AGAIN SO I'AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE LAST THING, IT WAS THE  HORRIBLE NIGHT I HAD EVER GOT SO I DEMEND FOR MY MONEY BACK!  [SEP]  I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL THE HUMAN BEINGS. MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECT ME IN SEVERAL WAYS, I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZES;  MORE CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE WE GET. NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE A BETTER USE OF MY TIME, IF I'AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HADN'T IT YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVEOVEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE COMPUTERS, I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINE IN THE WORLD, YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT, BY JUST USING THE INTERNET, IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME IN MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK, I MEAN IT'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WAIST BY MAKING THING WITHOUT A COMPUTER. BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PACIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE, THIS CAN BE BAD TO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BE CONFORTABLE WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORKS I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM.

316," Dear Mr, I am a foreign student who is on holidays here. I am going to stay here  a week. I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible. I'm sorry but I am very dissapointed with the musical show. I would like to explain  you my experience because I want you to give  my money back. The last Monday, I went to the theatre with two friends. We arrived on time but the musical show was delayed untill half-pass eight. Moreover, we hadn't any disscount for beeing students. On the other hand, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us. When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late. We couldn't have a drink. Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give  my money back because on the advertisement there was some things that we hadn't  in the theatre. Finally, it would be grateful if you could answer me soon. Yous sincerelly,  [SEP]  Our lives are changing. When I was a child I had different entertainments  that the actually children hadn't. We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy  without a computer. We hadn't so many machines than they have. The technology is growing and growing. If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want. It's very important but some times it is a wrong thing because the children can see it too. Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up. We can find information about the weather, sports on our TV-text. On the other hand, the science is changing. We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems. Actually, we can cure illness which were very dangerous before. I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer, UTH. The new technology is changing our lives. ",23.0
994," Dear Madam: I just receive your letter with the good news. I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June. For the accommodation I would like to have  log cabins rather than  tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy. I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities. I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers. Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget. Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food. On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family. I start thinking  what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost. In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort  choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depends on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested  to please.

1107," Dear Mr Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London. Especially the sightseeing by bus seems to be very interesting. But we would like to suggest you something: There is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear; make up and hairstyles on the 14th of March. It is called ,,The London Fashion and Leisure Show."" This would be a great opportunity   because we are all intrested in clothes, sports and fashion. I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students! Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum. The show lasts nine hours, from 10.00-19.00, the whole day! Our question now : Could we go to this show? We could maybe change Tuesday's programme to Wednesday. We all prefer   the show, free time is not so important for us. Please think about this and give us an answer. Thanks. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Dear Jack Thanks a lot for your letter. I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams. Therefore I read Agatha Christie's ,,Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". I can really recommend you this book, it is fabulous. It is also a suitable present for your cousin, I think. One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island. There is a storm and they can not leave. Suddenly a murderer happens! Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery. But I will not tell you  more. You have to read it yourself. And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book! Unfortunately it is quite expensive, £32. But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it! Okay, I hope to have news from you very soon. Have a good time. Yours sincerely, ",37.00

First of all the starring that was supposed to be  (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there, I was so enthusiastic about your starring, when I realized was a failure, even though they do good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there, at 19:15, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15, it cannot be possible that a schedule for a show  have had a big change. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait forever until  you want. Also  was said that Discounts will be available, but I didn't received any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people, do it. On the other hand, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization. That was so uncomfortable, people was starving. I am so disappointed with this, that I am in all my right to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't   expected. Please let me know . sincerely yours  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? I am 17 years old, and my life has been very normal. Since I've got a computer with  Internet, my social life has changed. Now I have more friends and I have more fun. This has helped me a lot, because I can talk with my friends that are living in other countries. Technology has a lot of programs that lead you communicate with others in a more easy way. 'Speak Freely' is fantastic, you don't pay and you can hear the voice of the one you miss. This has opened another world to me, distances aren't so sad, they are more close. I have learned a lot with  Internet, it gaves me the posibility to know more about things I've never knew . It is incredible how it opens  to you another reality, a different view of life. Now I have a different style of life, I am more open to  world's problems and progress. I am interesting in reading articles and developing myself. Technology had gave me another life,  has helped me. My knowledge has been developed and also my life style.

1055," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing on behalf of  students in your English class. Firstly, we are please and would like to thank you for your arrangement to taking us to London for 3 days. Unfortunately, some students have seen an advertisements for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we  all like to go to the show. This show will be taken place at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March at 10.00 - 19.00, which include the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is a great opportunity to visit  because it is shown only twice a year and the entrance is free for students. Furthermore, most of us are designers so this might help to up-dated their knowledge as well. Therefore, I would like to suggest that on Monday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March, we still stick with your plan. We might change the schedule on Tuesday 14 March, from visiting  Science Museum to The London fashion and Leisure Show. I would appreciate  if the matter can be settled down easily and look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I remember when I was in secondary school. At that time, my friends and I was so daring and full of energy. One day before  exam, we were so excited and frighten because we weren't ready for  exam. We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk. One of my friend came up with the idea that we had to steal them. The question was who would be the person do this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me. I was so scare and frighten because if I was caught I would be punished. However, I had to do it otherwise my friend would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it. So, that afternoon in lunch time, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely and calmly. Finally, I was succeed in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it back without anyone saw me. That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood. I wouldn't have imagined  if I had been caught. ",30.00

The answer is the following one: I only can travel  July because I have to work all August. I can take holidays only  the month of July. You ask me if I prefer to sleep in tents or log cabins. I prefer the tents because I never use such kind of accommodation. I have choosen the two following activities. First one is Tennis and  second one is sailing. I played tennis for many years. I have even done competitions. I like a lot this game. I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport. I love water but I never try this sport before. I would like to ask you two questions. How much money do I have to take with me for these two weeks and what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me? I'll be very happy to see you soon. Yours sincerly. Yves DUTEIL  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems. The first thing is the place of shopping. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping. The third thing is the trouble of full shops. Everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying  those things. People are often nervous and agressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women. There is one more thing. When you are a man and your wife asks you to come for shopping, be patient! Because women loves shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always giving your opinion about clothes, music, parfums... ",29.0

It is the only time of the year I have two weeks holiday. I would be grateful if you could give me a log cabin. It is more secure and there is no problem if it rains. As for the two activities, I would enjoy climbing and playing tennis. I have been climbing for more than 7 years. It should not be a problem. On the other hand, I have never played tennis in my life. But I watch every tournament on television. I like this sport very much. I would like to know if I need  special clothes, extra money or any other things. Could you please send me more details about that... I look forward to hearing from you. Charline Cholmondeley  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. There are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun. You often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress, the most beautiful shoes and so on... They are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to. This is very nice when you can do your shopping like that. The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have taken, you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again. Shopping is annoying but also necessary, it is why it is not always enjoyable.

First of all, you have asked me when I would like to travel. Actually, I could only travel in July, when I am having my school vacations and I will be totally free. As you have asked me about the accommodation, I would be grateful if I could stay in a tent - as it seems to be more practical and comfortable. Among the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - ,and Photography - from which I know just the basical skills. I would like to know if I should take  winter-clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely Natalia Lopes  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable With the increasing of violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres. Shopping may be very enjoyable, in fact, as people get in contact with new products, take a look at shops, buy some things or just walk around. But it can also be dangerous. First, most part of shoping centres uses artificial illumination and refiguration, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring. Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumism may develop to a compulsion. There are cases of people that can not spend one day without buying anything. After all that we can notice that shopping can be a good option as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time. ",35.0

I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musical and also I like Danny Brook. However, the reading actor was not him! Of course, I was so disappointed. The actor was not famous for his acting. Also the musical did not start on time, it was late thirty minuts. We just sat on the seat and nothing to do. I was going to a restaurant with my friends after the musical, but the musical finished at ten thirty. It was too late and we could not have a dinner. If the musical had started on time, we could have eaten in the restaurant. Fathermore, discounts was unavailable. Even though we had a student card. In the advertisement they said that tickets discounts  available. I think it  a bombastic. Anyway I was so unpleasement. It was not  marvellous evening. Could you back my money please? You have  responsoiblity for the audiences. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life?

If I watch TV too much I might not speak to my family  often. It will lack of communication. In addition, it is difficult turn it off. I think I should cut down  watching TV. Sometimes it  waste of time. What about computers? It is very useful too. I am living in London, but my father lives in Taiwan and my mother lives in Tokyo. I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone. Unfourtunately it is not so cheap. If I use e-mail  much easier and cheaper. And I can send e-mail anytime. If I  addicted on  internet, it will be  problem. I do not want to spend much time with computers. In conclusion. people include me need balance. We must be good at using computers. ",25.0

Secondly, the show was expected to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I have been waiting for 45 minuties. The poster also told me that I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show.

The world is changing every day. So, modern technology is needed to meet the requirement. In an every single day, many modern technology is produced and it really affects or changes our daily life. The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world's computers by some telephone liens. You can send a letter to your friend by an e-mail but not writting it on a piece of paper and send it by post. It just takes you a few minutes. How convenience it is! There are also much more advantages, you can buy somethings in a supermarket by only a mail order, you don't need to go out of your home. Other than the internet system, there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life. For example, we can go to the Mars and do some invesgation. So, we know much more about our universe. Some modern technology is also put into the transport system. For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster. The modern technology has changed our daily life. It aims at improving our standard of life and makes us live more comfortably. So I think the changes are good. ",21.0

I am quite good at swimming. I won the first price at the Regional Championship six years ago. But I think I'd rather do other activities what you show me in your letter like tennis.

Me for example, I don't particularly like shopping, when I go on my own, it can be bored. My sister loves shopping, she could stay trying clothes on all day in a shop. I am agree that the most of the people enjoy buying cloths, food, something for the house presents . Because  is something it goes with their culture. Sometime you can stay all day out just to buy a present for someone, it stard in the morning, and of course you have the breakfast somewhere, and it get later and you  still looking for it so you have the lunch, so finaly you spent more money than you thought  ",19.0
660," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan, I'm writing about the competition you organised. I have just received a letter from you where you say I won the first prize in you competition. I'm very glad about that and I also want to ask you a few questions. I can only travel to California this July because  it will be  my winter holidays. Before and after this period is impossible for me: I have classes and I also have to work. About the accommodation, I prefer to stay in tents. I have always dreamed about going camping and staying in a tent. Now my dream will finally come true. I think this way is better to keep in touch with the nature. I would like to do photografy and swimming. I love to take photos but I don't have  techinique. I would like to learn more about it. I have always swam and I can say I'm good on it. I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need to take, if it's cold out there and about the money. How much money do you think I have to take to buy food and anything else I will need? Do you have any idea about how much we spend per day? I'm looking forward from hearing from you, Yours sincerely, Raquel Soares  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. Is a kind of relief for them. Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery, anything. Specially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking  all the news in the stores. But, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should ... So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music. Remember: go shopping is not always the better choice. It can be very unpleasant sometimes. ",33.0

I know you want to learn what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month. As you know, our college was chosen to be there and help the singers and the musicians out. When I first arrived there I was pretty nervous and excited. My friends and I have been taken to the backstage where we met the members of West Life, Elton John and Robie Williams. I even go a bunch of flowers from them with a ""thank you"" letter. What we all did was making many cups of coffees and help to find their missing socks or any other clothings. What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebreties. I particularly liked listening  their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violen etc. Which was unbelievably great and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.

79,"  Dear Ms Clark, I had recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival. It was the first time I went and I was very pleased to go. I, actually, wasn't disappointed. However I would like to give my opinion about the festival. First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give. Therefore, you could invite artists from around the world  not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant. Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were  interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly meet some producers, who come from others countries in order to show different cultures. Besides, to pay one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time. Finally I suggest to invite important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it also  a kind of art! I look forward to seeing the next festival! Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Laurel, Thank you for your recent letter. I couldn't write sooner because I was very busy last week. I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed  or not to do at home. To begin with the wchool rules we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late at your lesson, you have to apologize you to your teacher. Also when you have forgotten to do your homeworks. What's more, you had better have done them if you would have to go to the blackboard! Although our library is very large, we mustn't make  noise in order not to disturb the students, who work. It may be like that in your library, may not  it? I consider the school rules are good: we should respect the teachers and people who need to work. At home, I have to look after my two little brothers when my parent's are here. If I don't make the cooking, I will have to do the washing up. I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks. Fortunately I can play  violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework. It is what I like most. I don't really want to change that, I think it is just like this. I hope this answer satisfies you. I look forward to receiving your next letter! Best wishes ",31.00
903," Dear Ms. Helen Ryan: I am very happy to know I won the prize for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I think I would like to travel only in July because at that time I am going to be free to travel because of my holidays in the school. I would rather to stay in  tents, because I have stayed in tents before and I liked , it is more pleasent than stay in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience. Refering about sports I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions. About basketball, I would say I like it to play as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool, I was not as good  as in swimming but I like it. I think I do not have anything to ask you, I just want to thank you for everything. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. I agree that shopping is not always ejoyable because a lot of things could occur  you. I remember when I was younger I used to go with my mom shopping to the stores but I did not like it, because I found  boring to buy clothes spending a lot of hours in a commercial centre. Another bad thing could be the enormous queues in the supermarkets, it is incredible how many time you can spend in there. The last month  was a robbery in a commercial centre next to my house, somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identifications, credit cards and cash, even more her flight ticket. Therefore she had to do a lot of tramits to cancell their credit cards and to change her flight ticket. Unlucky lady. To sum up I would say that even when shopping is not always enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option. ",26.0
1196," Dear Mrs Smith I am writing to reply  your letter you wrote  me on 10 June. Firstly, I would like to tell you, that the group has been booked into  Palace Hotel, which locates beside the congress house in the centre. You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury using the number 06 8793888. Secondly, the best way  from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which is specially organized by us. The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening. Off course there's also a bus number 8  in front of the hotel is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour. The end-of-conference party, which happens in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast. Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night. What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful. It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing. The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night. As you see, what to wear is just something casual. Finally, in the last afternoon, we could visit the museums, markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves. I hope your questions re answered appropriatly. I'm looking forward to seeing you on the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Computer Life Now-a-day computer can be found in almost every corner, in offices, in shops. Or even in cars and washmachines there're computer chips. What has computer affected to our life? First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait  the Kasse to take every article's note by hand. When booking a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search  it from  internet or on the local network. It's a very often heard, that someone, who has a special illness, gets  operations by a foreign institutes, which he find via  internet. Moreover, with computer network, it can be possible that people work from home, making projects, controling operations or having conferences. Lastly the way of communications has been also changed. Instead of the tranditional telecommunication, we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of  computer network. Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved. For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as  on papers. A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security. Till now, to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough. In conclusion, computer have become a very essential necessity of our life, and it's still a young invention, which need to be improved. ",27.00
1019," Dear Mr Robertson, I was interested in an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I would really love to go to the show. I am writing to appriciate for the good programme. It was so kind of you to have organised the programme. I would enjoy to see the show, especially a fashion show. I am keen on wearing and drawing some clothes. This show starts on Tuesday in  Central Exhibition of London from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Especially, students are free! It will be  great opportunity for me. I feel that it is such a nice experience and worthy. I would like to suggest  idea and change  sightseeing by bus on Monday, because the English weather is so changeable. If it rains, we will not be pleasant. Some of  friends would like to go to the British Museum and I have not been there before. Thank you again and I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear friend How are you? I'm fine. Thank you a lot for your letter and I hope you and your family are well. It's a good idea to give a book for your cousin's birthday present. I would like to recommend 'The Old Man and The Sea' because I've read it when I was teenager. It was such a wonderful story that I remember the old man speaking about human's life between the sea and the man. It may make him think of his future and this book could be very suitable for him. Let me know if he likes it or not and I hope we'll be able to get together before too long. I'm looking forward to hearing from you Love ",21.00
811," Dear Madam Helen Ryan, I have received your letter yesterday. I really thanks  for your organisation has given me the opportunities to go abroad U.S.A. The date that I would like to travel, that will be nice to go on  1st of July. Because my summer holidays break is start at  end of June. And I need  few days to prepare my stuff. Regarding to the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents more than log carbins because I have a lot of experiences of built up my own tents. When I was in highschool I used to be a member of the campfire. The activities that you have listed forms. Some of the them I  really interested in it, especially painting. Since I was young, my dad he alway took me out to have live drawings, so now it became  my hobbies. And I think, it is nice to draw the beautiful landscapes of the place. Beside drawings, swimming is my favourite as well. When I was in highschool, I have joined in the swimming club. And I also participated in a few swimming competition. Although I'm not the best, but I have a lot of confident in it. At last  some of things I need to clarify, that is, what type of clothes and  money do I need to prepared. Thanks again.  [SEP]  I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. For most of the people might think, why would I say that, because shopping is a very good entertainment especially for female, as me. For frank, I like to shopping. Of course not because of buying things. I like to have window shopping that is good to go arround the shopping area. It would help you  up to the date. What fashion is hit now. But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends. Then I can say I'm definatly doesn't feel any enjoyable. Because of the crowd. For me I think, it is not shopping that is kind of suffering. Especially, queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes. So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big festival, I would rather stay at home and watch television. ",17.0
1002," Dr Mrs Ryan, With replay on your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize. It was the real surprise for me. I would like to travel just in July, because I am going to study at my university untill the end of June. I hope it will not be any problem for you. I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid. I would prefer to live in the tent cabin, I think it is more comfortable. I see people who run the camp are very good in organize a social life of their guests. I have a lot of posibilities for spending my spare time. The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most. Generally I paint some landscapes by using the watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impresionist  by using blobs, oil paint and canvases. At the end I would like to ask what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I will need for the normal life at the camp. I am looking  to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Report on making a interesting video film The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be place at  video film about daily life at our school. In order to preper it I visited some clasrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school. Some of the teachers are very good just profesionalists. Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funy. For example, the teacher of history and polish language is able to interest students about the subject in differents ways. According to students' oppinions the most popular activities are the basketball, tennis, swimming and as well the photography group and the painting team. It is surprising that 45 per cent of the students questioned frequent one of this sport's group and 30 per cent of people go to the photography group. On the whole our school have a lot of different possibilities for the students what we can show on our film. It can maks the video more interesting. I recommend to show our teacher of history. It can show that during every day we have a big fun and we recived a good, important knowledge. If we take under an attention this things our film is going to be very interesting ",22.0
661," Dear Madam I'm very happy to have won in your competition. I'm never going in the U.S.A than I'm very exciting to travel at Camp California. I can to come only  July because I have to work the other months of Summer. As accomodation I'd prefer to sleep in  tents becaose I like beeing outside and earing the noises of the sea. My two  activities's choices are Climbing and Surfing. I used to climb and I want to try  still because climbing is good for the fit. I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations, but I have never practised that sport. I have one question to ask you. I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take it with me. He doesn't like stay alone at home. Yours faithfully Anton Chevalier  [SEP]  I purpose that we should be filmed five topics: A math lesson, an english lesson, a swimingpool lesson, the break and the staff room. - At the math lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher learn at his students. We could be filmed the class room too. - In the swimingpool we could been in the water and doing a party of water-polo and then Allan could done acrobatics stands, because he make competitions. - During the break we could show the activities of the students. for exemple students who play football or volleyball.

19," Jane Clark Organizer of  International Arts Festival Dear Sir, Mine name is John and I have been in the latest International Arts Festival. The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event. First, I would like to congratulate you for the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be profitable for next year's Festival. The artists you brought were only from six different countries, so I think you should next time try to offer us people from more different nationalities, to make it more interesting than it is already. Moreover, I have been thinking about changing the location because, as you probably already know, some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted go in. Finally, I just would like to recommend you not to give up showing movies, during the Festival because the crowds were amazed with that, and keep on offering the current prices, one of the best deal for us, the spectators. If you would like to talk about my suggestions, please, do not hesitate  and let me know. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Independent Student Magazine Here is my article. There are many ways to earn money, specially in a big city, like the one where we are studing all year around. Some examples could be delivering pizzas or newspapers, working as a bartender throug the nights, cleaning services, etc. I usually call these jobs non- cualified positions. I think, as a consecuence, that there is no difficulty in finding a job for our spare time. What it really makes us, the students, upset, is to find the perfect job. To be more technically and specifically, we need a very flexible job, wich gives  independence and allow us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period. Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us should be a position related with our carreer. Next year I expect myself finishing my studies in LAW. And by that time I will have already some experience, so that I will more easily  able to apply for a really good job. So, Why don't we think more about the future, instead of being upset of how to get some money to spend  next party? ",24.00
143," Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook, starring  all the scenes. Instead, you changed  actor without any warning, so I didn't find my favourite Danny Brook, with my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would have a right on it. At the top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the troubles you caused me. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Most people think modern technologies aren't so positive as they are often showed . My personal theory is completely different. I have always a good approach with all of the most recent invenctions or any other kind of modern applications. We live in the age of personal computers, of  internet, of the mobile phones, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It' already four years since I bought my first cellular phone ( then I changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend and to my family than before. Anyway, the thing that has most changed my daily life is the personal computer and, expecially,  internet. For example, now I'm writing my thesis, but I use my pc everytime I have to write a document in a perfect form. Then, surfing in  internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic! ",30.0

I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday. I would like to use a tent for my accommodation. I think it is more interesting than  log cabins. I can be more next  nuture and I have never used tents before. It seems to be exciting. I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming. When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games. It was such a good time. I enjoy painting as well. My mother told me that I'm good at painting. When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition. My parents were very pround of me. Could I ask you some questions?

I'm taking the final exam next month. Lucky me! I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I worked as a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really exciting. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do in the concert. It was such a big concert. There were lots of singers and  band. Of course, there were lots of spectaculars. First, I was in front of the entrance door. I had to check tickets. I was really exciting. My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well. After that, I went to the back stage. I could see lots of pop stars. I'm sorry that I didn't ask them to take any pictures for you. I was really busy. I had to take care of them and did everything they want. For instance, taking them to  toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff. It was really busy but I really enjoyed it. I learnt lots of thing from here that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I knew lots of people from different job. It was a great time. I'd better close now. I've got lots of homework to do. Take care of yourself and I look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes, ",28.0

I would prefer to stay in  log cabin because it must be cold to stay in a tent. I have some problems with my kidneys, so I can't stay in on of the tents, and it also must be very comfortable to stay  a log cabin. I'm really good at Golf and Tennis, so I would like to choose these two activities. I've been doing these activities for a very long time. I've been playing Golf for five years, and I'm a handidate cup of sixteen, but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day.

It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones. Unless this preparation, I also took part to the concert. I helped them to  the music and to the songs. It was a quite difficult assiment but I got  very good experience. I understood it when the concert had finished. The audients was excited and I cannot discribe my happyness. It was some thing that I didn't expect. Also, it happen  first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs.

I live in Greece, and especially in an island, so I know very well what summer means. It means swimming at the wonderfull beaches, tasting the delicious foods ad having  wonderful time every day and every night with your friends. Also it means to meet other people, to have fun together, to travel at all the places of the island. I think that the summer makes people to feel great, to have fun, to enjoy themselves.

First of all, I have to tell you that my only chance is go there in July, it does not matter the dates, but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August, because that day I will start a summer job. About he acommodation during those two weeks, I would rather staying in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to be in a little and close room. Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp, after browse through the list, I would like to take part in climbing and photography activities, as these are my favourite hobbies. I had a induction climbing course two years ago, and I still going to climbing regulary, I can do a V+ level climb. On the other hand I had a photography course five years ago, and I took part in several competitions. Finally, could you tell me how far is the nearest town or village? Can we get there by public transport? Looking forward for your answer. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping, what an exciting thing! Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular, the shopping centers are always busy,  people going up and down carrying bags and looking at window shops,  seems everbody is happy. Really? Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare. Firstly  is the parking problem, if you go to shopping late at weekends for instance, it's really difficult to find a place to park your car, and when you get the place,  pay for it! Then the search for a nice cloth starts, and when eventually you get it, it isn't your size, but also the colour that you like is not available. Finally you've found out something really wonderful, time to pay! With the hurries you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use the plastic money, the shop assistant pass the credit card through the machine, after  few seconds  again, and  another time more, suddenly his face changes and  says you that the card is fault! No choice, you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad. To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shooping center  still there waiting for you! ",33.0
836," DEAR MS. RYAN,  IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT. I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE WONNER OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH. IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA, WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE. ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME, ACCOMMODATION'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO. ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY. THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER. WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY. CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING (ASPECIALLY IN POLAND, WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS, MOTORS OR COMPUTERS. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST). BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR  BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION. PEOPLE, WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD  BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE). ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE. EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY). BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT. IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A LIFE-STYLE, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS. ",27.0

The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk. Actually, the college is situated 500 meters away from the Hotel. As you know, the conference will be followed by a party. It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening. You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event. In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day, therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on. To conclude, we decided to organize a guided tour by coach, as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off. I hope the international student conference will help   to know each other better and that it will be a success. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me  information on an interesting building to visit. There is so many places of interest in Lausanne, but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons: The Olympic Museum dates from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe. It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece. You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them. You can admire every kind of equipments you need to do any particular sport. You will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowaday n high competitions. The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking. It will takes you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor,  well-known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne. I hope my recommendations will help you in the choice of a building to visit. Yours faithfully, ",36.00
1212," Dear Mrs Smith, I have just read your letter and I am happy to help with giving you some further information. According to your first question, for the time of  conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel, where the reservation has been already made. It is situated near to our college, about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station, which is South Wimbledon. As you were informed, there will be a party for all attendants of the conference, which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant. Minding the fact that it will be  entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event. Finally, answering your last question about  student's day-out, I suggest visiting a local Lawn tennis Museums and  Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions. If you have any further questione, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  TO: Leader of the group of American students FROM: DATE: 12.06.2001. SUBJECT: Recomnendations of a place to visit INTRODUCTION: The aim of this report is to give  description and  recommendation of the most interesting building in the town. GENERAL INFORMATION: The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth-century Royal Palace. It is situated in a heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of an Old Town. There is a square old Market with the magnificent statue of the King Zygmunt, in the centre of it. FACILITIES: . Inside the Palace, there is a museum of an antique collection of porcalaine. . There is also a Portrait Gallery in the left wing of the Palace. . The Old Town is the best place for  afternoon stroll with a great deal of restaurants, caffes and street performers. . There is an easy reach to cashpoints, lavatories, emergency services, etc. POSITIVE POINTS . It is easy to get there by any sort of public transport . There are  numbers of hotels or youth hostels  to stay overninight, if necessary . Most of the admissions are absolutely free. NEGATIVE POINTS . A part of the Palace might be closed, due to the constant renovations. . All the facilities are usually overcrowded during a summer holiday. CONCLUSION: Despite the few drawbacks, I would strongly recommend the Royal Palace as the most suitable place to visit for the foreign students. ",36.00
582," . I would like to travel only  July because I would be in schools holydays  and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip which is boring?! And when the sun is shining you are relax and you feel good. . I would prefer  tents to sleep  at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents  to compare   in a house. You are in communication with the nature and you can hear the insects. And we only need to sleep and not to cook or watch T.V... It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable. . From the list below, the two activities I will choose are Tennis and sailing. Tennis because I play Tennis and I am classed 15-5. I like very much Tennis because it is a technical and physical sport. And you need  strategie to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside in the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind,  the ball becomes incontrolable!  Windsurfing because I pratise it for a long time. You can do it alone. I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and slide like skiing, surfing. you need technics to move the windsurf. You must know how to use the wind and you have great sensations! I would like to ask you questions: Must I take with me my clothes? Is there a washing machine at Camp California? Do I need some money to pay  the meals!  [SEP]  you have recently had a class discussion about shopping. Now your english teacher has asked you to write a composition, giving your opinions on : ""shopping is not always enjoyable"" In fact, shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you don't have enough money! You don't find anything interesting in the shop. You can hesitate  to choose an article. Which is the best article to take? The seller can be not very nice and watch you all the time. You don't find your size or the good color in the article. The article can be too expensive. It looks fragil and it could break easily. Your must test several shops and compare the price, the quality of the articles. So you must walk all the day or go by car. And the weather must be fine if you walk in the town. Shopping is not always enjoyable if there is a lot of people in the shops because you can't move and choose the article and be cool! ",28.0
1229," 12 June 2001 Dear Mrs Smith Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001. I hope I can give you the information you need. So the conference will be a great experience to you and your group. Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel. The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station. A free shuttel-bus gets you to the conference-center. The bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel. The end-of-conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground. There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and many more. It is a surprice! I suggest to wear leisure-clothes to the party. The last afternoon you could go on a city-tour, visite the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park. I hope I could give you some ideas. I look forward to seeing you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  What would life be without the phone? Have you ever thought about a world without  phone? How was it in the 18 century with no opportunity  to communicate by phone and how would it be now? I can not imagine how our life would be. We are living in a busy world. In the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients, to make appointments, to order an article e.c.; then, time is money! How has the phone affected my own life? I think, that is a good question to think about. I could not call my friends from an other city and just say ""hello"". It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment. So, what did the phone-revolution for us? It saves  time. ",29.00
610," 13. June. 00 Dear Mrs Ryan, I have been the happiest woman since I have got your letter. I could not believe my eyes. This was the first competition which I took part  and I have won the first prize. It is incredible! I would like to give you some information. First of all, I would like to travel on  19th of July and come back on  2nd of August, because I have to work until 19th of July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have been at log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it. This time I want to try something different. I would also like to tell you about my free-time activities. I like painting and climbing. I am actually not so good at climbing, but I like the fear of risks and dangers. My painting is not bad, but many people don't like the way I paint, because I use only  pencil. I am happy`,, because I will have the chance to do this two activities. Finally, I would like to ask you if I should take a lot of clothes with me, because I do not know what's the weather like there. My last question were; how much money do I need? I hope, I have answered all  questions.  I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjeyable. If I had the possibility, I would never go shopping to the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can not find the items what you want to buy. When I was at  supermarket last week I suddenly decided not buying from a supermarket at all. First of all you need a lot of time, because the market is so big. Secondly, you have a lot of choises and you do not know which one to buy. Lastly, there is a recyling problem which many people do not care about. You buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish. For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend water, although I should do it. I think I am too sensible. I'd prefer to go  the markets which are open and outside. So you can ask about the qualities and prices and get immediately your answers. In my opinion, small  and the markets outsides should be supported, on the other hand the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.

724," Dear Helen, I am writing to answer your letter, which I have recieved yesterday. First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very appreciate that all costs are paid for. I could travel only in July because my exam will be finished in the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off  my journey on 15th July. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years in which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf by the professional coaches. I'm enjoy playing both of them regularly. In addition, it would be nice if you could send me an address  which I am going to stay, so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family. Finally, thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  ""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I think this statement is true. In my opinion, shopping is not suitable for children whose age is under 18! This is quite a strong opinion , but I know it from my real-life experiences of shopping. When I was 15, I was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything I could find now unneccessary. I'm not dare to culculate how much I have spent for those things without thinking. However, it was not bad, my mom always told me that I hadn't have earned enough money so that I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way. Therefore, people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children  for shopping and buying such tempting objects. To sum up, shopping is not a wrong thing to do as long as you can earn money yourself and know what you are spending it for! ",31.0
858," Dear Ms. Helen Ryan I am very happy to here from you that I have won first prize in your competition - twe weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. and I am writing for my information to tell you.

How much money should I take and should I take only casual clothes and trainers? I am looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim. Thank you for your lovely letter and I hope you are well. The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really  interesting than I expected. My job at behind the stage was helping  make-up, hare and clothes staylist. It was very hard. The singers often changed them clothes and them make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat. It was different from  I did  at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singer and spoke to them. In front of the stage was so many people and they couldn't see them very well, but I was at very near from the stage and I could see them just there. You like pop music, don't you? So, don't go to a concert! Work at a concert! That's much more exciting. Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't met each other  so long time and I'll tell you more story of this. Write soon, Bye Bye. ",23.0
731," Dear Ms. Ryan I am writing in response to the letter, which I had yesterday. I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give   details, which you would like to know. First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only on July. Because I have to work all year except one month holiday on July. Secondly, I would be appreciate  if I could stay in log cabins at Camp. I feel that it would be fabulos places with  western design. Most of all, I am really interested in doing two activities. I am very good at Tennis. However, I haven't had any idea about sailing. So, I would like to try both of them. Lastly, I would be grateful if I could have  following informations. I would like to know about  clothes, which are suitable for activities. As well as that, I wonder if I have to take some money for extra activities and  few more things. Thank you for  time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you. yours sincerely Jae Hwa. Kim.  [SEP]  There was a meeting to talk about a video about daily life at our school. It was thought that a normal, regular lesson, 3 optional lessons and a great deal of activities should be filmed. Refering to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming. I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn. There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting,  photography should be included. It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school. As well as that, if we filmed famous students and teachers in our school, it would be a fantastic video. In my opinion, students can learn English from wide activities as well as lessons. That's why they prefer to film a lot of activities. ",30.0
62," Dear Madam, I'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it ""international"" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (mentioned to be ""from around the world"") were from only six countries. Maybe the eason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones. On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose  impressed me  most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year. I also thank you for the excellent idea of  one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in. My suggestion for next year's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer! Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Friend, Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it. If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them in a nutshell. We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often. At home I don't have many rules either. I must wash the dishes from time to time (I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty) and clean our house. I don't think there is anything I'd like to change. I'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours! Your faithfully, ",37.00
1140," Dear Mrs Brown, It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come at the party. All the students wanted to organise a surprise party for Mr Brown. Next Tuesday is his birthday. We would like you to come and if you can to help us in an important decision. Firstly, we should tell you that it is a surprise party. He must not learn about it subsequently you must not tell him. Secondly, the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June at  College Canteen. We think the suitable time will be 3-6 p.m. You can come earlier, if you want. We would have junky food, some juices and drinks. Moreover, will come some teacher, of course all the students and the Principal. On the other hand, we do not know what to give him as a present. Can you help us? We want something that it would like him or  would be necessary. Please try to come and help us to this problem. We ar looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  John said he had some good news to tell me. I am waiting  him to come. Suddenly the bell rings. I thought that  would be John and  was he. We had finished the exams two weeks ago and we were waiting for the results. The first good new was that we both had passed the exams. It was a wonderful new. Then we thought about going for swimming to discuss about some things. The second new was that he had found a job for the summer. He would go to work in a café. He would earn a lot of money, in addition they wanted an another person. As a result I had a work too. We had the greatest day. Then we had an idea! We would have much money from the work. At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia. We imagine that would be the best holidays in our life. ",25.0
1221,"  Mrs Smith, I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the Conference. I hope I can answer your questions. At First, this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education. In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can go by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station. The Conference will happen in the Hotel, which is so much easier. The Conference, not being modest, it is a quite well organized. It will starts at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students. I am very happy that you want to know  my area, although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough. However, if you want, you can call me and I can show you some interesting places. I will be very glad. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Affecting Our Lifes Cars, boats, motobikes, airplanes: Who did never use this once? This is a good question. The humans seems always that they are running and the fastest of this inventions is certainly, the airplane. At First, when Santos Dummont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think how the people could transform his creation. In this world, where the nations fight to be the better one couldn't be diferent: the airplane became the most important thing in the war. Unfortunately, it was used to kill a lot of people. However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities. How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definetely, by air. After this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us. So, the airplane is definitely an important invention, because it have changed people's life in wars. Until now, it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world. Let's congratulate Santos Dummont! ",25.00
111," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about your musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". Last week I was on holiday at London and I was very dissappointed when I visited your theatre. First of all the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed untill 20.15, and when the show finally began we were supriced to see that Danny Brook who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replace him and he was really disappointing. Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available with the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there was not any. Last but not least, the advertisement says to visit your restaurant after the show, but when we went to the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill. The advertisement says that it is going to be your perfect evening out, but it was not. it was a complete waste of time and money. That is why I would like to request  full refund of my money. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but she was her best friend and she had to trust her. Anna told her again: ""Pat don't tell it to anyone please, especially to my brother everything will be ruin then"". and Pat answered: ""Don't wory I won't tell anyone"". The big secret was that Anna was prearing a suprice party for her brother, John and she didn't want anyone to know about it. She had told it to Pat though and that was extremely dangerous! Anna couldn't do anything though because she needed her help to give  the invitations. The party was set up to be in two days. The two days passed really fast and Anna was happy because Pat hadn't told anything to her brother, or so she thought! Pat went to Anna's and she seemed really unhappy. - ""Anna I have a confession to make"" Pat told  her and she started crying - ""What is it Pat?"" Anna asked and she started to worry. - ""I've told your brother about the party. I couldn't help it!, I'm so sorry!"" - ""What?"" Anna couldn't believe it, she was devastated, she started crying and told Pat ""Get out of my house, now!!!"" Pat left. Everything were destroyed the party and their friendship. ",32.0
411," Saturday 17th June Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied about it. Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to be appeared. Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical show was annoying. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it. I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing. I would you informed us before. Secondly, furthermore I had to pay full price whereas you granted us some discount prices. I was very interested in visiting your theatre restaurant after the show but it seemed to me it was closed. Your assistant prevented us from visiting it because it was too late and he was so busy. Finally, you thought that you could grant us a perfect evening but it was not true. Consequently, I would like you refund my bill. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Nowadays, we need modern technology to improve on daily life. In my opinion, science and technology will have consequences on my behaviours. First of all, as you also know, lots of technology have boosted since  few years. For example, without using  internet I could not put me through to foreign people. This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as a eagle. I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phone, lap top computer, television, to have contacts with different cultures. Secondly, technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before. Unfortunately, it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars, factories. I can't go to the towncentre of  big city. There are links between the greenhouse, technology and me. To conclude, we must not forget that science and technology is a tool   to live better. Be carefull, my own technology can kill me. I can use it but with some limits. ",22.0
323," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about your musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", which I recently saw at the Circle Theatre. It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several points didn't worked out as promised in your advertisement. First of all, there were no discounts available, and having payed £20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30. As a second point, the actor was not Danny Brook, as displayed, but someone else I've never had heard of before. His acting and singing was horrible. At last, after all these disadvantages, I was not able to have diner in your theatre restaurant. It was closed of some reason I still don't know. You see, it was not the ""perfect evening out"", as you had promised in the advertisement. Therefor, I would like to ask for at least half of my money back. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon, Yours faithfully, Ewe P Meier  [SEP]  The pressure of secrets Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And if he had been able to keep one, the following story wouldn't have happened. Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance. And always, every body made it surprisingly well. What was the reason? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick, when he had finished it to get his opinion. Nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it. And the girlfriend of Nick happened to be in Pat's class. She was quite clever and had known everything about this, so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared. You see, each little secret is a kind of pressure to Pat, and he only feels free if he can tell someone about it. And this is the same for everybody, isn't it? Or can you keep a secret? ",27.0
266," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about some problems I had when I went to the Circle Theatre two weeks ago. Firstly, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were supposed to perform in the show but instead of them different actors performed badly. Secondly, the show should have had started at 19:30 but it started later, at 20:15. The Theatre also promised discounts, which were not available, so I had to pay the full amount. I also wanted to visit the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was impossible because it closed at 20:30 and the show finished at 21:00 Finaly, I would like to ask you  £20 back as I was not satisfied with your services. I hope you pay attention to my complains. I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for both of us, but I will if I consider it necessary. I will be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours Faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets but she was my best friend and I had to tell someone what had happened to me. So I phoned her and told her the whole story. Last weekend in the Local Festival, that is held every year in our Town, I was walking with my little sister, who is three years old. She started running and got lost. So while I was looking for her I saw the Director of my school, Mr Smythe, stealing money from a small shop. I could not believe my eyes! When Mr Smythe saw me there, he told me: ""If you say a word you're going to be in serious trouble."" But Pat could not resist the temptention of calling the police. We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me ""May I talk to you?"". In that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I faint. When I came around Mr Smythe was under arrest and fortunately,  thing finished well for me. ",34.0
11,"  Ms Clark, I am writing to you in order to give you some advice about the annual International Arts Festival. Last season I spent two days at the Festival. I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better. First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can know artists who cames from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last edition there were artists who cames from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa. Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts of different kind of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concerts hall were too small, and because of it I couldn't see one of the concerts in  programme. In my opinion, one of the best things of the last Festival was that there were not only concerts . I saw films and I played ping-pong. In the next edition will  be more or less ? I hope more. The thing that I liked much more than others, was that I had to buy only one ticket for all  events, and it was no pricey. It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you, I think you should do a baby-parking, in fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sons. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  I like read very much, because every book that I read shows me a different world. What I try to explain is that in every book there are characters or situations  really different. So we can read realistic stories or fantastic , it depends from what we prefer. I always prefer read books that are inusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity of escape from the everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without doubts, Wuthering Heights a famous book written by Emily Brontë. The attention of the  is focused on the unfortunate love of Heatcliff and Catherine. They are the main characters of that book, and what caracterize them is the violence of their passions. In this book you can find only good or bad characters, everything is good or bad. If you look at this book like a painting you can't see afumature of colours, you see only primary colours. In other words, when I read a book I want to go in a world where I can find something different from my everyday life. ",28.00
736," Dear Ms. Ryan, I am so glad. I have won first prize in your competition! It was a really big surprise for me. I will join The Camp California in the U.S.A. with pleasure. I would like to travel there in July, because only in July I can have holiday. In June and in August I will have to work, so it would be rather impossible for me to join Camp California then. I would like to have an accomodation in  log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent. So if I could choose I would like to stay in a log cabin. Being at the Camp I would like to swim and to play tennis. I have swam for 10 years and I have played tennis since I was 9 years old and those activities I like best. I thin I am the best in horse riding; I even have my own horse, so if it is possible I would like to ride horses at Camp California. I am looking forward for hearing from you. Yours sincerely Felicia Zajac  [SEP]  It was a bright, shinny day. I woke up early in the morning and I decided to go shopping. Warsaw's ,, Clif'' is my favourite shopping centre so I went there. I saw a beautiful, long dress. I decided to try it on. - What is your size - said  shop-assistant. - 36 - I said. - Och, I am very sorry, but we have run out of 36 size. I was going to the chemist to buy some eye-shadow, when I saw black, suede shoes. Those shoes must be mine! - I thought. I went in and I asked the shop assistant if I could try it on. - Yes, of course- she replied- but what is your size? - 38 - I said. - I'am very sorry but we do not have 38. I was very angry. I had some money, I wanted to spend them, but?! Everything did not suit me! It was enough! I came back home - tired and angry. Surely it was not the best day for shopping. I did not buy anything, although I tried. So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoable. ",27.0
976," Dear madame I'm very surprised about the good news and I'm sure I'll really have a good time in California. I'm happy to answer to your questions. First of all, I would like to travel in July because my boss won't let me free in August. Secondly, I would like to stay in  tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can. Regarding to the activities, I choose swimming and tennis. I'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See. I don't think I'll have the chance of doing it again in the future. On the contrary, I'm an absolute beginner in playing tennis and I'm not fit  in running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time. There is something I would like to ask you. What kind of clothes am I supposed to bring with me? And what about money? Should I bring cash or a credit card is all I will need? And what about sanitary precautions? I can't ?look forward to start this adventure. Yours sincerily Carla Reale  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do. In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions just like the other women do. When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and  harder to find it. I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me. And if this is a problem to me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) should feel. Often they must go in special shops to by their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life. Will this ever change? I hope so, but, in the meantime, I'm on a diet. ",33.0
174," Dear the manage of  theatre, I went to the circle theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW. I really expected the musical show, but it was a disappointing show. At first, you advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it had different actor disappointely. Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it deleyed to 20:15. I had to wait 45 minutes, wasting time. Thirdly, tickets were £10, £15 and £20, and I knew that these were available to discount, following the advertisement. But it was impossible. And I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed though they said it was possible to visit  theatre restaurant after the show, they didn't prepare  at all. Even if one of your woman officer annoyed my question, I asked that why they didn't prepare restaurant, as if they advertised like that. But she was annoyed me. You said it would be  perfect evening, but it wasn't. It was  upset evening. So I ask for money back to you. I couldn't be satisfied  your theatre. I hope you accept my suggestion. With  hopeness  you understand me. Elsy Sun.  [SEP]  Unfortunely, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat talks others secrets to everyone easily. At first when he had a girlfriend, they talked to each other franckly. His girl friend talked to him  everything. Because she believed him. But after they seperated, his told his friends her secrets without considering. And when his friend, J, got  big problem, J asked Pat and his friend for help him. It was about his private problem, related  his friendship in  whole school. If he had told everybody, J would have been blamed by  whole school. But he forgot it and told his friends. Actually it was not on his purpose. But sometimes, Pat mistakes to speak someone's secrets. Though it was not on his purpose, it makes his friends leave him. They can't believe him. Pat also regrets about his speaking. It could be difficult for him to change himself. It is like his one of bad habbits. Poor Pat, now he is blamed by everyone such as the people who he talked their secrets to everybody. ",19.0
1020," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing to you as a representative of the class about the 3-day school trip which has been organized for next week. First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organization of this trip which seems to be very interesting and useful for the students. Especially I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us. All the students are enthusiastic about it. However, some of them have read an advertisment about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March. The Exhibition will show all the latest fashion in a very wide range from sports wear to make up and even hairstyles. What is more, the show is free for all the students. We feel that taking part to it would be a great opportunity to us since we will be able to have some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our days. Under the circumstances, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it could be possible to make some changes in the programme if it could to visit the Exhibition. It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 19.00pm, so we could give up the shopping and go to the show in the afternoon. I hope you will consider this possibility and tell us as soon as possible if you intend to accept our proposal. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes. But not always famous people are happy of their condition. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: ""I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do"" There is no surprise to this answer: famous people can not have their own private life. Whenever they go out they are suddenly ""hounded"" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph. But the worst thing of all is that they are often  victim of malicious gossips, which most of the times are not even true. In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings, on the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed: not always, in fact, money and celebrity being happiness. ",34.00
912," Dear Madame Helen Ryan Competition Organiser I've just received your letter and I thank you very much indeed for that. I didn't expect to win the first prize in your competition, I am very happy. It was always my dream to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Now it's become a reality. If I can choose the period, I would like to travel only in July because in other months I have a lot of thing to do. As accommnodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in  log cabins because I think it is safier than in a tent. I've red that I will have a chance to do two extra activities while I will be at Camp. I think it would be a good idea to practise my photography, because I'm not so good a photographer and I would like to learn swimming as I can't do it. Taking part in these two activities would be very useful for me. There is another thing I would  know, what kind of clothes have I bring with me? And how much money can I take with me? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely -  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. This is true. Some days ago my class had a big discussion about shopping. In that occasion I hadn't the opportunity for giving my opinion about this task. Now, my English teacher has asked me to explane all what I think. In my opinion, nowdays, shopping is very easy and in the same time very hard. It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy, shops are plenty of every kinds of things. You can chose the price more suitable for you. Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me. Shopping is not enjoyable when you have not enough money to buy what you want, or when you are not sure about what you would like to buy. I remember very well two people who thought very different about shopping. My grandmother thought that shopping was a terrible thing, she hadn't enough money to buy even the bread. My mother, whereas was very keen on shopping  everything. ",28.0
946," Tuesday, 13nd June 2000 Dear Ms Ryan, I've just received the letter telling me that I've won first prize in your competition. I guess you can imagine how happy and excited I am at this time. Here are the few information about my stay at Camp California, that you asked my to complete: For the date of the travel, I wonder if it would be possible  in July because I'm going to pass a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great occasion for me to relax after that. You asked my to chose my accommodation between  tents and cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I made a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year) The activities listed in your letter seemded to be all interesting. I choosed to do baskelball (I play in a club, I have a good level) and  photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California). Talking about California, I suppose that the weather is hot there in Summer. Could you please tell me if I have to take  special clothes with me. If it's not two much to ask, could you also tell me how much money I should take with me for food or evening activities at the camp Looking for you to receive those information, Dominique  [SEP]  Last week I had planned to change my old basketball shoes. So I took the train to Lausanne (I live in Lavaux and it's impossible to find a corect pair of sneakers in this whole damned city!) to buy a new pair to play outdoor  this summer. After having visited  shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for. The shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive) So I went back to the station, very proud of me with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face. I stayed that happy during the travel, thinking of how cool I would look on the playground with my brand new shoes on. As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag, I had forgotten it in the train! How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play with old shoes for one more summer... ",25.0
1033," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing  you to thank  for your program which will be for us in the next three days in London. Especially, sightseeing by bus in the morning and  river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities. On your program of Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show which is held once a year. This show  give us a lot of informations about current activities, fashion and what is happened here in London  for example  lastest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up,  hairstyles. It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn  london culture. We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion. The admission is free for students. The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon program  to go to the show at  Central Exhibition Hall instead. If you agree, after  Science Museum, we can have lunch at  restaurant near the musuem, then we  go directly from the restaurant to  Central Exhibition Hall. We will be on time for the second show at 13.30 P.M and we can enjoy the show until 19.00 P.M. I'am looking forward to hearing your opinion on my suggestion. Your sincerely,  [SEP]  The Home of the Future ""Home"" has so much meaning to the people. It doesn't mater who they are, where they are coming from, which color of their skin they have. Home is  institution that create human and make them as a person and a good member in their communities. When I think of ""the Home of the Future"". I want to have a home which is built with a new material. Home made out of plastic  also windows made out of plastic therefore we can have our home for a long time. The door it is broken, we can replace it rapidly and it is not expensive when it is plastic. We have more time to stay together at home, watching TV, playing games, etc.... because we can access to  internet at home we can have all  informations from  internet. I think it is the best way of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home. We have more time for the family who need mostly care and love. It will be a numer of Developments in Technology in the future, which can make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is  feeling of being together and love. This 2 feelings can not be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home of the future. ",26.00
555," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan, Thank you very much for your letter. I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize. First of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something. The only time that  is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday. For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece. The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say, that I am quite good in climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my live, so that is an activity I have to learn. Last but not least there are some things I would like to know: What kind of wheather do you have in California? Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me? And what about money? How much money Should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many persons are going to stay in each tent. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Many people, especially women, love shopping. If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat. But shopping is not always enjoyable. First of all because of the big variety in the store. Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila. And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want. Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded. Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people. And many people are in a hurry, so don't wonder if other people have not  tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars. Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause, which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine . That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about. ",33.0
951,"  Miss Helen Ryan, I was receveid your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA. So I will answer you about this different points. I would like to travel only  July because I think, it's the best month for  enjoy my holidays. About my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more confortable than a tent and less hot with the sun. Nevertheless, I hope, there are water and light inside this log cabine. Between your different activities, I will like to practice: 1. Surfing because I never do it and I will like to learn it. 2. Photography because during my freetime I make some pictures about persons, country, -- - So, I will want to have more experience and a better technique to succed at a good level. Nowthere, I would like know if it's possible to change my activities during my sejar. Can I change some moneys in the Camp or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And know the different prices for the same holidays? Thank you for answer my different questions. Salutations.  [SEP]  The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys,  times; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD, whatever. But, it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in a office, a manufactory, a society, you have the same planning to them. So you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go the Saturdays but  badly,  there are too  costumers. You can't walk,  try clothes ,  it's very hot. The salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service. In England, there aren't paper for make a present. It's different than the other European countries. Sometimes the sales women aren't friendship, because they have some stress or they aren't the sale feeling. Finally I think, it will be better if the shops stay open until 7.30 pm (half past seven). It will be a good service for their costumer and  more cool for them. ",18.0
170," London, June 17th Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to make  complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre. Firstly, I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement. Then, I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one (very bad) as well. Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence. Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me. As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't appear. Those were the reasons for my asking  a refund of the £20 I paid. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Every day we find out new devices that promise us to satisfy our needs. I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful. I can't remember waking up with the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee. Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one  I consider as the most important influence technology had in my life: the computer and Internet. The improvement of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places, look for information or even keep  close contact with friends all over the world. Now, I will never say again that I don't know where can I find some information about this or that and when on holidays or every time I make a new friend, I just ask for the email  and that's enough to know we will know about each other soon.

16," Dear Jane Clark Hello, I spent two days at your annual international arts festival. I was very impressed and I wish you could make the festival better next year. I think  International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other country's art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many country's people. You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small  that the people can't even dance in classical concerts. This years' 'plays and films' was too short. I was very disappointed about this, but the other shows were great. I felt very good about all these shows. In my opinion, the tickets for all events is a wonderful idea, because everybody has a chance to see everything and the people would think this is a great festival. What do you think about picking five people and give them tickets for 'Art Travel'? I think this is a good idea. Generally it was very good and I wish more people would come next year. Yours Faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back  soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same. First, In school, we are not allowed to run. This is very important, because many accidents happen because of running. When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best  what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other student's study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some family have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday. I think the main rule is when you can play computer games, because they love computer games. Tell me about English rules. I'm curious about it. Your best wishes from   ",27.00
1075," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing with reference to the three day trip in London. Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting. Especially,  sightseeing by bus must be enjoyable. However, my classmates and I also found another fascinating thing about the trip. It is 'The London Fashion and Leisure Show' at  Central Exhibition Hall in London on  14th of March, which shows the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all found it exciting and exhilarating. It must be a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes. In addition, students can go without paying any fees. Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March. We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping. We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon at the free time. I would be grateful, if you could understand our concern and change the programme on 14th of March. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are always followed by journalists. Do they have to give up their private lives? First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well-known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others. Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandales usually increase their fame, even if they did anything wrong. On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded , as they are the same as us, human beings. It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life. To sum up, although I think they ought to abondone their lives partly when they entre the world of fame, they should take some actions against journalists in order to protect their human rights.

969," Dear Helen Ryan, I am very pleased to hear that I have won first prize in your competition and  writing to you to offer additional information, as requested. First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August. I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents. I have once experienced to have been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago. Once more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming  for a long time. How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf since I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have  chance to play golf at camp. Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano. In fact I have been playing the piano for  children's choir for 5 years. Additionally I would like to know which kind of clothes I should prepare. What's the weather like in California? How much money should I bring with me for  two week stay? I would be really greateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are things these days? Sorry not to write  you for a long time. I've been busy preparing  English exams. You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful chance. As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of  electric shock on his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accident so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon! I hope you can go  the next concert with me. Longing for hearing from you. Love, ",39.0
348," Dear Sir, I went to your show called ""Over The Rainbow"" and I was really disappointing in many points. Firstly, you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove,  instead of them we had two others and they were really bad. So I was really surprised. In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late. It was boring for everybody. How could we appreciate the show properly. Moreover, in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case. No discounts were available. Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people. You offered something impossible to do. I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give  my money back. I hope your understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible. Thank you. yours sincerely O. Labro  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started at this time. I though she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me yet but when I came in  class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her all the story. She said that I had to be strong and didn't care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stopped because he loved me and wanted to be with me. At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh.

61," Dear Jane Clark, I'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced the last 21 and 22 of November. I want you to know how  extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend. The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. On my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small, you've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Miguel Thanks for your letter. I got it a couple of days ago and I've been thinking about what you said. I'm going to tell you what I feel. In my house rules practically don't exist because I have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that I study  a carrear and be a good man. They only want to know where I am and when I go out  at what time I came home. At school  is complete different because the teachers don't foregive you nothing. You have to be quiet an attention in class if you wouldn't  to be punished. I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things. I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things. When I'd time I will write  you again Love, ",20.00
81," 17th December, 2000 Jane Clark, organizer Dear Madam, I'm writing this letter to congratulate you for the excellent international arts festival we could enjoy last November. I found it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think can be improved in the following editions. First of all, because of the advertisement I expected starts and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries. Artists from different cultures may make the festival even more interesting. Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because  the short number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival. Finally, the prize was reasonably and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend. I hope you'll attend my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Once upon a time, in a small Catalan village, there was a little boy who loved cheating and making jokes. His father was a shelter,  He had one hundred sheeps and one dog, and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them. One day, he became ill and was worried about the animals. His little son, called Joan, decided quickly: ""I will help you. I will take care of the sheeps for you, father"". the next day he went to the mountain with the animals. At the beginning he was excited but soon he got bored. ""Let's have a bit of fun"", he thought. And then he started shouting: ""the fox! Help me! the fox!"" Some people went to help him, and then realised that it was not true. They were angry. He did it  more times, and at last nobody cared of the shoutings. One day, the fox attacked his animals and he shouted as much as he could. Nobody came. Then he learned to say always the truth. ",31.00
740," Dear Helen Ryan. I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me  some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend to a 'Development & Research Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as a assistant from the beginning of Aguest. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have ever slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in  tent. Whole night, I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. Especially I love water-painting. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be  fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't swimming at all. I'm afraid of water. That  why I couldn't have swimmed yet. I think this chance is  very good for me to learn to swim. I expect to join  above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'll buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into the every shops. I always want to buy T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, cosmetic, hairband, accessories, ring, earings, bracelet, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationeries, interior stuffs and CD. But it is impossible to buy everything at the same time. I have to chose some of them and I have to give up buying most of them. Before I go out home, I make a plan. What  is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items. But when I stand at every shops, I can't stand my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something what I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be  very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think  why I'm so poor. But I can get over . I go window shopping. Insead of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try every  shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jakect on. They are mine! Shopping is not always enjoyable. But if you think positive opinion about shopping, It will make you the happiest and the riches man in the world. ",26.0
945," Dear Sirs, Thank you, it's great to hear for about my winning. You ask me for some informations - here they are. First I can do the travel only in July, because I can't get  freetime in any other month. The next thing is, that I would prefer a log cabine. I don't want to sleep in a tent, because I'm afraid of snakes and similar animals. About the activities during the Camp I can tell you, that I like to play Tennis and I do it very good. Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play Golf. It's a very favourite sport also in our region (area), but I did never found time to do it. I'm a beginner in Golf you have to know. Now a question from me to you: Is it possible to pay  the different things with credit-card? Another question - what sorts of clothes shall I bring with me? Is July a hot and dry month or is it raining sometimes? I think, this will be all I want to know. If there is any other question from your part, please call me or write again. I'm looking forward to hear from you, yours sincerely  [SEP]  Hi Kim, sorry, I'm late I know, but now I will tell you something about my experience last month. The concert started on the 15th of may and it was a real great session in our valley. I was so happy when they told me to help them with the organisation. I was responsible to the advertisments and I had also to invite the ""important persons"" from our governement. It was realy a new job for me, but I think, I have done good. I've learned a lot about management and especially - how stars are living. One evening we went all together out for diner and after we visited  our new disco. We arrived at home early in the morning - it was great. Now Kim, I will finish my letter but I promise you to write again as soon as possible, maybe if I've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the .... A good idea at least - you come here and I tell you some other story's. In the meanwhile enjoy your life - love ",34.0
64," Dear Jane Clark, I would like to congratulate you on your wonderful ""Arts Festival"". You have a really great idea to create this sort of Festival. I had a lot of fun to go there. I would like to come next year with a great pleasure. I hope you will not  angry if I give you some advice? At first, I would like to talk about your section ""Stars and Artists"". This section is really great and attract a lot of people. From my point of view, it will better if you have some ""Stars and Artists"" from only six countries. Because the spectators will probably  more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities. I also would like to talk about your concerts. The concerts are fabulous but the problems are the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something for these problems? All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of ""Plays and films"". I love films and Plays also, and I'll hope to have more films or Plays next year. Concerning the tickets, I think your price is reasonable for this festival. It is a good idea to have reasonably-priced  for weekends. I'm looking forward do hearing from you, Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Phil, I'm really happy to receive your letter and I hope you are fine. I'm fine but I have a lot of work to do for my school. My exams start the next month that's why I have a lot of work. In your letter, you want to know about my school rules in France and you also want to know what I am or I am not allowed to do at home. Alright, I'm going to answer your questions. At first; . You are not allowed to smoke, drink or to take some drugs in my school. You must to be outside during the break. You must sign your notebook to your parents every week. You are not allowed to argue with your teacher after you receive an exam. You must to be on time at school or you have a punishment. I have so many other rules but these are the most important. At home, I'm not allowed to watch television after 8 p.m. I must do my home work when I come back at home. I also must to help my parents in home activities. For example; to clean my room and the other rooms, or to cook, etc.... I Hope these information will help you, Keep in touch, Love. ",25.00
476," Dear manager, My name is Joseph and I am writing this letter to complain about the mass that the adimnistration of the Circle theatre presented to me. Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre. We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's favorite actor, but we seems quite disappointing, my son was very happy because he would see for the first time his favorite actor. However it's just the begining of the problems we had. Expecting the britan pontuality we went to the theatre at 19:00 to wath the 19:30 section but it only starts at 20:15, it finished later than it was suposed to and then we missed the train. I haven't seen any discounts available, I though my son would payed less than I. As we had alredy missed the first  we went at the theatre restaurant that is famous for the good food, however it was closed. In spite of this,  less you can do for us is to give  my money back and work hard so that this theater that is famouis about its beauty and pontuality don't become famous about it desorganized shows. Thanks,  [SEP]  People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes had become to. Clothes that used to be made of coton, but nowadays we can see shirts, pants socks....made of almost everything. It is a revolution in the fashion that is starting now. Nowadays we have drifit a kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our body ,  clothes that don't get wet or even dirty. Computers that make some little things for us nowadays, but at the speed at  tecnology goes in the next century those clothes will tell our doctors  our healt at any moment, any time, any where, people will be able to locate us arround the world. In the future we won't by clothes by size or even color, our clothes will adapt to our body, the weather, our fit so,  our necessities. It already started and don't have limites to go. ",26.0
558," Dear Sir, After having read your letter, I write to you to inform you that I would like to travel in July. It is the only month where I don't work. As for the accommodations I would prefer a tent, there's nothing like hearing raindrops on canvas at night! Last but not least, I would like to go sailing and climbing. I have sailed some in my youth but have never went climbing. It would be a fun experiance! Will I be needing any money. Please send me a list of needed clothes and/or supplies. Thank you very much. Yours sincerely, Gilbert Neville P.S. I would like to know if there is a medical staff present during the two weeks? Does any medication  have to be declared to them? In case of any accidents, will the transport back home be paid for?  [SEP]  Why can shopping be unenjoyable? First of all, it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for. Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment  anything they see. Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know. Women, in perticular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see. If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes (usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when  being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance. It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots an othe pair. Shopping for me is supposed to be a very fast experiance. As soon as someone else is with you, it can become horrible! ",31.0
390," Dear Sir, I am writting in order to complain about the musical show  which name is Over the Rainbow that I could see in your theatre recently. I like very much this musical and while I was spending some days in London I could see you advertisement so I decided to go to see it. First of all I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement. It was a pitty but it did not annoye me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 . So I entered to the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight (three quarters  delayed). Then I got nervous and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained  us the reasons  . Finally, when the musical started I realized that Danny Brook, my favourite actor, was not there. In your advertisement his name was in main letters and in the musical the actor was different. After the show I decided to go to drink a coffee and to smoke a cigarrete to try calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the free day for the barman. I am very indignatged because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you return my money and take notes of all these problems. If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE? A long time ago technology wasn't an important element for people because they didn't appreciate it. Change weren't a normal situation and Governments didn't invest enough money on it. Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day. For instance, modern technology is changing the way I work. My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things on that I wasted a lot of time before. Not only are the computers useful for keep information but also computers can give you a lot of information due to  Internet. On the other hand, I realized that modern technology not is as good as people think: I hate mobiles. I know that some people need them to work but I can't understand why teenagers need it. To sum up, modern technology is changing my work, my life, and my friends. Maybe it would be a nice idea to analize these changes and to put limits to technology, because I think that the most important  is  our life and no the ways we  improve it. ",28.0
766," Dear Miss Ryan, I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me on the letter. First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month  summer vacation that is in July. I appriciate it if it will be the first two weeks of the month. Next, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I need to have a time to relax when I travel. Therefore, I would prefer a log cabin. For activities, my first choise is basketball. I have been playing it since I was nine years old. In high school, I was in a school team and I enjoyed playing it with my team mate, even though we were not a strong team. My second choise is golf. I had never played it until last month. However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a biginner, so I would like to practice and have fun at the camp. Lastly, I would like to know whether I should bring some money and what kind of clothes I should bring. Thank you for giving me this great opportunity. I will be expecting to hear from you. Yours sincerely, Hideo Kojima  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I've got your letter yesterday. I enjoyed reading how you spent time with your family and had fun at the Park. Thank you. As I have told you, I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty, a local band in which one of my friends played guiter. He knew that I'd wanted to work at a concert hall, possibly as a lighting technician. So he suggested me to help  their concert so that I could know behind the scenes. When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought me to a room. He explained  me that it was to controll the light. It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights. However, when it came to the real concert, it was very hard. When the concert was finished, I was exhausted but happy. I'll write you back. Friend, ",27.0
523," Dear Sir! I am writing with reference to your theatre. I would like to apologise  you for my controversary opinnion but I feel really disappointed. Firstly I would like to explain  you where the problem is. I came to London for a short journey to meet new poeple and to have a meeting with an English culture. I've seen your advertisment which had recommended the play 'Over the rainbow' and I enjoyed it very much. I decided to go to the Circle Theatre with  hope that your show will provide me  all these emotions that I have been looking for in Great Britain. Please forgive me but you didn't do your best. I heard about Danny Brook in Poland and I wanted to see him on the scene but it wasn't hardly possible. There was a change of the leader-actor what annoyed me indeed. Further more the show was to begin at about 19.30 but it didin't. You were 45 minutes late. Waiting was horrible. On the advertisment was written 'DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE' shall I ask you one question? - Why they weren't available? Everybody were schocked and I was trying to keep the faith. I didin't expect more surprises at your Theatre. Nevertheless after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restarrant and what  I've seen? A poster: ""Closed because of the illness of the chef."" There were some more disappointing situations about which I don't want to write. Eventually - you offered a wonderflul evening but I must say that if I had known that it is going to be like that I wouldn't have wasted my time. I feel honoured to write this letter and I feel the oportunity. I would like to recieve back my money. I am looking forward to hearing you from you. Your faithfuly  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main adventage is that, it provides you  all the informations that you need. For example you have to write an Essay about  2-nd world war. You get into the internet and you're looking for those facts and informations which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Further more you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly this advantage has especially changed my life. Playing the games takes me a lot of time and it became a bad habit. I have no time for learning and for domestic works. On the other hand playing games and using a computer wide my brain so as you can see this modern staft has got many advantages and disadvantages. The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful either. I have got a steady contact with my parents and friends. I have no problems with changing the time of  meeting because I can always phone. But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation. The modern technologies brought to my life a lot of changes. It is even seen in the domestic works. For example I've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons hardly itself. My mother is happy and I am happier because I don't need to put an effort to iron the clothes. I only press the button and everything is going alright. These are the main reasons why I admit that technology has changed my life and other people's life. I admire  people who made those machines and I would like to give them the tribute. They made my life better. ",26.0

I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California, because I have never gone to  U.S.A. I would prefer to travel only in July, because I have not to work and because I would prefer to have accomodation in  tent and so I think that july is the best period to spend two weeks in  tent. I have just been  in  tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interested adventure. During the journey I would do surfing and photography. I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I had gone to a surfing-course for five years and I won a lot of prizes. I like also doing photography because they can be memories IN my future. I would  receive further information about which kind of clothes I should put off during my holiday and I would  know if I should bring with me a lot of money. Looking forward to spending my holiday in the USA I wait  your letter. Your sincerelly Guillelmina Farina.

I woke up at six a.m. and I worked until nine p.m. but it isn't a problem for me, because I like spending my time with other people. I particularly liked to know people of different countries and some pop-stars, which were friendly with us. I was surprised of the co-operation that there was during the job, because it was as a big family, where each member helped  others. There was a lot of work to do but we were happy to do it with glad people and at the end we had the possibility to take part in the pop concert. It was wonderful! Looking forward to meeting you as soon as possible. I greet you. Best wishes Guillelmina ",25.0
47," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited. First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great. It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from six countries. Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world. Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although, some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival. Another disadvatage of the festival's programme was  lack of plays and films which are the best  to display the modern county's culture. I suppose. I hope there will be more of them next year. I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced. In conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done. For example, the next year's one may last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for  greater amount of people. The programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs. Thank you for your kind attention. Sincerely yours,  [SEP]  Everybody wants to earn a bit of money. Especially young people who are always out of their small budget. Fortunatelly, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays. Of course, young people can work only in their spare time. It mean that a job should be part-time. So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish for example. Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy however. But you can earn more. Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday. But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may chose a more pieceful job of a typist at home. There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer. So, you can help them and earn quiete enough. To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in  Arctic. ",30.00
238," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you after visiting your theatre. Frankly speaking, I was very disappointed after my visit. I was displeased from the very beginning, because I expected to get a discount as I'm a student. According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all. But nevertheless I decided to go to your show. The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30. I had to wait in  overcrowded hall. When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor. One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook's participance. So, you could understand how disappointed I was. To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed. So I hadn't such  perfect evening, as was promised in your advertisment. In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? In my opinion, modern technologies play the important role in people's life. I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies. Both computer and  Internet influence people's life. I have to use  computer every day. It helps me in preparing my homeworks. Firs of all  Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information. On the one hand  Internet is often used for entertaiment, but on the other hand it's also used in different business and education process! With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me  chance to improve my English. From my point of view,  Internet can be used in education, because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers. Though  Internet has a lot of positive aspects I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it. ",27.0
12," Dear Mrs Clark, The discovery of the ôInternational Arts Festivalö was a pleasure for me because it gave me the opportunity to enjoy onto a really nice environment. The proposal of reasonably-piced package including tickets and accomodations, well supported my personal organization: comfortable rooms  easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide  at  last minute. As far as the Festival itself is concerned some small improvements could let it works better.  Different kinds of music is a good idea but some of them need special features. Larger concert halls can allow people to better enjoy the quality of  performances. Also the introduction of different cultural experiences is a good idea but six countries can't be really considered as world wide representative. The aim to satisfy different interests should not let the quality decrease. Just a final note: why not  more plays and films for the next year? Thanks in advance for your attention Regards  [SEP]  Are you young, are you a student? Do you want to earn money? You are not alone! There are ôseveralö opportunities for you: - ask for money to your parents (mum is better), is the most traditional way but also the safest one - emprove your kindness and ask for works in restaurants or pubs,  is a good training period for real life too (be patient with demanding people is always required) - test your health and ask for an outdoor activity (seting as  sandwich-man can also hep to test your pride) - check your pal wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Phili, Cuba, Zambania,  Morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer small wages for ôsmallö jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and ôfind yourselfö Anyway, the best suggestion is always the ôbest ideaö, the famous ôsuch a good ideaö that might change your lifeà.

Actually I will be busy working abroad until the end of June and will be on holidays with my family in August. You asked me which accomodation I would prefer. It's ages since I have been sleeping in a tent and I would be happy to experiment it again. It will remind me  some wonderful experiences. According to the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at. The second activity I chose is sailing. I went two times on a sailing ship without doing anything, therefore have I got no experience at all. May I ask you how much money do I need and which sort of clothes do you advise me to take? I look forward to your answer and to the camp, naturally. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Thank you very much for your last letter. As you asked me in your letter, I will try to explain my wonderful experience at this pop concert. First of all you have to know that it wasn't a common pop concert, but a real open air festival. It isn't the first year that I work there. However this year wasn't like last year. My job was as simple as selling ice-creams. You might say that it is quite boring, but it was so funny. Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream. It was  amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland. I look forward to hearing from you and wish you all the best. Love from ",31.0

However, we've started to search an idea for it for one months . In the beginning, I wanted to bring him in my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at his home. So Sigone found the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought for him a dog. Leon hate dog, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognized. And I found one. I had a friend who had just received a little dog. But he was a Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck. ",28.0
309," Dear Manager: I reciently was in London,  in my sister's home, and I went to se ""Over the Rainbow"". I had a lots of problems and I would like to tell you about them. Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that  promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put  on the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got late to the show, when I got to my place, it was used (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started, I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I find myself that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor. And finally when the show ended I decided to go  eat something, but the restaurant was closed because the chef was sick. Sorry, but all these stuff are not proffesional, and I am going to make a demand exactly because you don't have that, if you don't give me my money back. I hope you understand me  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Yesterday I decided to go to the ""blue disco"" because the guy I liked was going to be there. But there was a little problem and it was that my parent's didn't let me go alone to disco's, so I had to go illegaly, and I decided I would do it. That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I went out  my window. I had told Pat to pick me up, she was the only one that new my plan. I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret. So when we arrived to the disco there was my guy waiting for me. To sumarize the night I am going steady with him, and he took me home. The next morning Pat came to my house, I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive  last night?... All the truth was then told, and now I am grownded for life. She defintevely doesn't know how to keep secrets. ",30.0
500," 17th JUNE 2000. DEAR SIR, I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW OF THIS THEATRE. FIRST OF ALL, DIFFERENTLY OF ADVERTISED, THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK, BUT OTHER UNKNOWN PERSON. TO MAKE MATTER WORSE, THE SHOW DELAYED STARTING AT 20:15. AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT IN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET. ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT OF THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT  PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED. SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT REPLY. YOURS FAITHFULLY, MARCOS ALMO BRAS DE BARODO.  [SEP]  IT'S UNDENYABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING. NEWS INVENTS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN IN QUICK PROGRESS. AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE'S DAILY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGING AS WELL. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT, IT'S WORTH TO POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING: FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST WAYS OF TRANSPORT. IN THE SAME WAY, WE CAN TRAVEL INSIDE OUR COUNTRY QUICKLY AND SAFELY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE'VE GOT FACILITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TOO. SECONDLY, WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE  CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES, BY  INTERNET, WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ALSO ABROAD. FINALLY, WE CAN CONSIDER, TOO, THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS ABOUT HEALTH,  ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON. IN CONCLUSION, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGGINING OF THIS CENTURY. THE SCIENCE AND THE TECHNOLOGY ARE THE MAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. ",29.0
463," Dear Manager, I have recently seen ""Over the rainbow"" and I must tell you that I'm really disappointed! I found the advertisement about this show in a newspaper and thought it would be fun. I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring, I booked the ticket imagetly. But, instead there was a different actor, who I never heard about before! The show should start at 19.30, but it didn't start until 20.15! So, because of that, I missed my last bus home! While we were waiting for the show to start, we were thinking of going to the restaurant. In fact, it was closed the whole evening, because of some work . As I'm a student, I usually get discounts on different things, so I was so disappointed when I couldn't get it here! I'm really upset and disappointed after all this and at least I want my money back! It could have been a perfect evening out, but it wasn't! yours sincerely Karol Johannes  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed my daily life? I belong to this generation who had grown up with a lot of different technolgy. For example TV, telephone, micrown etc. But  the last few years, it has change and so many new important things had been discovered. What I'm talking about are the computer, which now can be found in almost every home and of course, the mobile phone! I tought I would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now I can't live without it! But the discovery that I'm most thankful to is the computor and the Internet! Thanks to it, I can easy communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England. It's so quick and not too expensive either. To use the mobile phone by the way, is very expensive. I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends. So, I start every day,  swiching on my mobile phone, to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e-mail and that's just the begining of the day...

154," Dear Sir/Madam I am writting  you for complaining about the last saturday evening performance in your theatre. I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this changing before . Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late. We would not have had  discounts on  price and any worker wanted to give us an explanation for that. After the show, we decided to go to the restaurant to dinner, but it was closed for work. Everything was completely different from what you had announced on the advertisement I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction, I mean, refunding me exactly what I had paid for this terrible evening. I look forward to hearing from you very soon. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent  . A simple example, we can at the same time wash our clothes with a washing machine, record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world. All this in one morning, and the day just begins, what  doing next? Technology allows  to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to . We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention, time is not a really problem. We will see people differently, with more calm, because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more comprehensible with others. It is the first step for a true fraternity. Of course, everything can not be completely perfect. All this modern technology increase the level of polluted products that can not be easily destructed. Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to product more food, but more food means chemical agents on  earth, the circle never stops. In conclusion, modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like, although I know, all this has a price. ",26.0
636," Dear Sir/Madam: Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested. First of all, I think I would like to travel in July, which will be the only month for me to go. Because my course won't finish until the end of June, and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term. Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others . However, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose,  one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most, I and my friend used to win the first place in  school-wide match when we was in school. And  the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; Painting is one of my hobbies and I've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it once I have  free time. Above are all the information you asked , however, here are something I'd like to know;  first is about the clothes, what kind of clothes  I need to take with ? And another question is what is the prices of things like in there,  so that I can make a better buget of my trip. Look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would  interested at my experience of helping  the pop concert last time, now I tell you about it. The place  we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage, the equitment, and the lights. In fact, there is nothing very important I did, because we are not the right people to do it. I only put the speakers in the right places, or helping  engieners tested the lights. But at the brakes and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engieners, and I leant something about setting up the equitment. The fourth day, the singers and the players have been to there to test. Then I had a chance to speak with them. From that, I learnt more about  instruments. Finally, the date of  concer came. After the concer finished successfully, I was happier than ever because the succeed inclueded my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life. Anyway, now I have to stop to finish my homework. I'm looking forward to receiving your letter again. Best wishes. ",24.0
537," Dear Mr./Mrs: I have just received your letter in which you inform  that I won  first prize of two weeks at Camp California. I am very excited about it! I would like to travel on July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have for vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that  weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in  tents because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case. I would love to participate in the singing and photography activities. Singing is something I have enjoyed since I was a little child. In fact, I took some singing lessons. I am not very good at photography but I want to make an album to share it with my family when I come home. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes do you recommend for the camping? How much money will I need? Is it better to take cash or a credit card? Thanks for your attention. Cordially yours,  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable The best way to go shopping is when you think in advance  what you really want to buy and you know how much money you estimate to spend. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought. Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking. The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!! Recommendations? Wait for a sunny day, take a look into your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping ! ",33.0
131," Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to complain about a musical show, which I have seen in your theatre, in London during my holiday. According to the advertisement, which appeared in one of the London's newspapers, I would like to present you  some of my complaines about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you ""offered"" has been changed. The man who played the main male role was different than this one, who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start has been changed, making your show delayed for nearlly one hour! In your offer I noticed an information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another ""defect"" in the advertisement was an ""invitation"" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown for me reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information telling about a cause of closing it). Finally, you guaranteed ""a perfect evening out"", but for me it was the worst visit in  theatre in two years time. To sum up, I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre. Neither  beautiful surranding near your theatre nor  comfortable sits will not recompansate  my horrible evening. Therefore, I would like you to send my money back, because I think I deserve it as a viewer. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Technology is very important in our life. Mainly, because it makes it easier and more comfortable. Nevertheless it has some advantages and drawbacks. In my opinion my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet her ""at every corner"": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my life-style for  better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done,  washing machine which makes my clothes clean again. Recently, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers,  internet, super-fast cars etc. These improvements helps me with my ordinary dutes. I can do my homework on  computer, prepare for the class test by searching  information in  Internet and use a mobile phone every time when I want to connect with one of my parents. However, technology has a bad influence on us, generally on our healf. Couple of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones make a possibility of getting sick with cancer. Also fast and well-improved car increase a risk of pollution of our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents. In conclusion I think that modern technology makes our life easier, nevertheless, we should avoid any possible risks connected with these improvements. Then we will be able to say that technology is something we should be proud of. ",29.0
832," Dear Helen Ryan Thank you for your letter. I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I can go only on July because I'm a student. It's summer holiday during that time. I want to know if it is avaliabile during that time. First of all I would be pleased if the accommodation is in  log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent. It'll make me like at the village. I like painting, and once I won first prize in the university competition. I think I'll have  chance to draw the pictures, and I'll show  my friends who have never been there before. Another activities I would prefer is sailing. My father was a sailor when I was child. I was draged  to learn sailing. I'm good at it. It would be exciting. Fathermore I would like to ask you which kind  clothes I need to take and how much money I'll spend. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Recently we have a class discussion about shopping. All of the students agree with that shopping is not always enjoyable. Women always enjoy shopping. But a lot of incovenients anoy them. So they said they do not always enjoy shopping. First of all the car parking is not convinent and  expensive. Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car. Sometimes you have to park your car in a futher place then walk to the supermarket. Futhermore when you look aroud the supermarket, you can't easyly find the goods which you want to buy. It's very confusing without  right singho. Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.  Otherwise men always don't like shopping, while their wives are doing  shopping they sit in the car or read  newspaper. They would be happy if there are sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket. They'll change their mind. Instead of hating shopping they will enjoying shopping. In my opinion nowadays shopping is not always enjoyable. ",24.0
1223," Dear Mrs Maria Smith Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning. Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are comeing now. You asked me which hotel the group had been booked . It is the Palace hotel, about a mile away  where the conference will take place. The best way to get there, is to take the bus number 7. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will leave the bus at ,,Royal gardens"". Turn left and go straight to ,,Baker street"" At the need of this street there is the house number 18. This is our college. You wish to know all about ,,the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us by their songs. Moreover you asked what to wear. Do not bother. I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes, like a jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket. Donnot forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have  chance to change it. Finally I give you some advise for what you could do for about three hours. Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum, it is located near the hotel. Furthemore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located to walk within five minutes. Lastly there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows. For further information please call me up. I hope you will have an interesting conference here. I am looking forward  seeing you Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The telephone a very important invention In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived. It has been in her parents' appartement. The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls. Todays nobody could imagine such a situation. In every household there is a telephone at least. There are a lot of advantages for it. Firstly people are able to talk to  person on every time. Be it: just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins. Moreover we always can call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor. This could save  life! An other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it. Of course there is also a big disadvantage. All people know this situation; people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone. Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time. Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention. To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things. It is always the same  how to people use it or not and how people handle it. ",23.00
311," Dear Sirs We are writting to you to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"",  we saw last week in your Theatre. We have spent a week's holiday in London and wanted to see a musical show. We read an advertisement about your musical show, starred by the well-known Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in a local newspaper We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by other  at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it started actually at 20:15 due to the probleme of the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts wasn't available for us, because they didn't accept our student indentity card from Switzerland. We were very frustrated to read on the door of the theatre restaurant ""Close due to holidays"" specially when we were very starving. This evening was a waste of time. So we asked you for our money back. I  looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours Sincerely  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? Could you figure out how your life will be without all the modern technology? What is the effect of it  in your environement? Were the people happier in a past than to day? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested by this article. Nowadays, the technology takes  a large place in your daily life and improves the speed of the achievement. For example at work, we look on the computer screen all day, sending e-mail at the other side of the world, doing some searches etc. We gain a lot of time with  computer, but if your computer brooks down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it. The technology moves very fast specially in the domaine of transportation. The cars are able to reach 300 km per hours speed and are more reliable than in the past. The major probleme for the industry cities is to deal with the bad effect of polution in the environement. A lot of money are involved in research to stop the increasing   of polution. To sum up, all the improvements have a price to pay; The condition of the environement. We are too reliable at technology today. But we can ask us ""What will be happen in 50 years? Our children will be able to travel in the moon as we travel to Japan? ",24.0

There problems were; Firstly, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there for your musical show, I was unhappy to constat that it was different actors this evening. Secondly, the show of 19:30 only started at 20:15; Thirdly, your advertisement said: ""Discounts available""; but it wasn't the case. Fourthly, the restaurant was closed for renovations and you don't have to propose us to go. Like you can see, I'm very disappointed for this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money. That's why I ask you to give  my money back. I ask you give me £20, back by check. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  How has modern technology changed your daily life? The technology is the future, and the present. For instance,  internet. All the world is now connected on it.  Internet is the ""new"" revolution of the communication and knowledge. It is now ten years that  Internet exists, but we only  used it for army and government . Now, everybody who work in  commercial companies use every day  Internet. The technology means too, every electrical machines, which don't stop to be developped. Another example, computers, every six months, something better is discovered. The modern technology has changed my daily life in every day. For instance, the meats, we don't cook our meals, everything is already done. Five minutes in the micro-waves and it's ready. The machines have replaced the work of the humains. We use every day technological machines without to know. All our life is symplifying by the machines for not waste the time to work on their developpment. ",25.0

I am afraid I can only make it on July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University on August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July. The accommodation I prefer is  tent. I haven't tied it before. I would like to know how interesting it is to live in tents. If I can only choose two activities while I am at the Camp, I would like climbing and Basketball. I started climbing since I was a child. I love it very much. About the Basketball, I have been played it for seven years. I would like to play basketball with local people at the Camp to see how good they are, if I can. Finally, may I ask  some more informations. What kinds of clothes shall I take? how about the weather there? Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip. Also, may I take a friend with me, how much will she pay? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, JIA LI LO  [SEP]  To: Teacher Cheng From: Jia Lo Date: 13/06/00 Subject: a short video about daily life at school As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions of this short video. I found that most of them had suggested that four lessons should be filmed which  as follow: 1. Grammer, which is the base of learning English. 2. Speaking, it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper. Let you do more pratices. 3. Listening, it  really helpful for improving your listening and understanding. 4. Writing, this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write. Also, there are two activities  should be filmed. 1. Students are talking to each other when they are having  break. It is important to pratise your English after lessons. 2. Teacher are helping students with their problems. If you have  problem on studing,  asking  teachers  is the best way . In Conclusion, the short video is only 60 minutes. It must show the daily lifes of the English students at the school. It should include all those points lists above. ",25.0
1138," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for your effort, which you have made to organize this three days programm in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there especially in the National Art Gallery. Nevertheless, the students in my class have some suggestions for you  how to make it even more interesting. The thing is that we have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be held in  Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday, 14th of March, from 10.00 to 19.00. Naturally, all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown there. Futhermore, students can enter free! We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London. Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London. Probably, you will agree just to put  London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of  Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday. Thank you for your attenlion and understanding. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The Home of the Future Dear Reader, I have decided to describe my home of the future or, in other words, the place where people will live in 100 years. Well, I suppose that almost everything in  future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers, which will control every thing, every item of furiture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programm them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they just will stay in their rooms and study from  computer,  some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly. It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.. This will be your home, another member of your family and your house or flat together. This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it. ",35.00

First of all, July is the only month I can travel in because I will have to start working from August, and I would like to stay in a tent when I am at the Camp so that I can enjoy the great atmosphere which tents only can make and I love. I would also like to tell you which two activities I am keen to do at the Camp. One of them is basketball, which I have been playing for over seven years, and I am the captain of my university basketball team. The other one is tennis, which is also my favorite sports and I have been playing for several years. I go to elementary school to teach children how to play tennis every Wednesday and Friday. I am therefore writing to enquire about some things. What I would like to know is what the weather is like so that I can bring appropriate clothes and also how much money I should bring. Lastly, I would like to know how many people are comming to the Camp I will go . I sould be grateful if you would send me  further information that I asked  and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Makoto Tanaka  [SEP]  For a short video Introduction The aim of this report is to summarize the results of a survey about lessons and other activities which should be filmed. This report is based on a sample of over 80 students of my school. Favorite lessons Interestingly, over half of the students who were asked enjoy attending history class, while 30 per cent are keen to take an art and music class, and a small number of the student (less than 15 per cent) like to take social studies class. Favorite activities Not surprisingly, football was well-preferred as an activity which students do after school generally (over 30 per cent) and also about 25 per cent preferred baseball. Amazingly, over 20 per cent of the students would like to take up handball from next year. Conclusion To sum up, it seems that there are so many interesting lessons and activities at our school, ",29.0
989," Dear Helen Ryan I am writing to provide you with the information that you require to arrange my two week holidays at Camp California in the U.S.A I would like to travel in July because, as I am working, this is the only time that I have to go on holidays. About the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have  bad back and I think that to sleep in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me. You also told me that I would have the chance of doing two activities. I would like to go climbing, because it is something that I have been doing since I was a child, so I could consider myself an expert in it. And I would like to try golf because this is a sport that I have never practised but I have always wanted to try. Finally, I would like to enquire about how much money I should take with me and also what kind of clothes would be most suitable to wear. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  It is said that shopping is becoming a new way of life for more and more people in the developed countries. Many people leave so many other activities for the pleasure of buying as many things as they can afford. Let us then ask: 'Is this activitie always enjoyable?' Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. Far from the strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money. However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her. On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping it is not a difficult activitie, it is also true that  is definetly not an enjoyable one. ",37.0

I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I gothave become accostomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at the army - I would prefer  log cabin for my stay in the camp. Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy, I still enjoy swimming especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition, that means I do swimming just for fun. The other activity I choose is Photography. Usually I take just holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art.... I think there are no more questions I'm looking forward to seeing you. Yours  [SEP]  I'm the teacher of that class. The children are seven to eight years old. The video that will be made should demonstrate how  day in school is like. - I start the day by greeting the children and they answer - in English, of course. Then I tell them to sit down. - The first lesson will deal with animals on a farm. I will show pictures of animals and the children will tell me the name of that animal. - Later on we'll go to sing the song of ""Old McDonald had a farm"". - The third part of the film will show the children's painting work ""Animals on a farm"". - Some sequences of the gym-lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that presents how  children have their lunch and spend their free-time, what games they play in the school-yard and how they have contact with each other. Each part of the film mentioned above should not be longer than 5 to 10 minutes. The whole film when it's finished will last for about half an hour. ",30.0
1015," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for organising the school trip in London. I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class. Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme? The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. According to the advertisement I have seen, it is supposed to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is also free to enter for students. It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with strongest motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping at a free time on 15th March. I sincerely hope this letter will be of some help. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  I believe that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for some reasons. First of all, they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrity. Therefore, they should deserve to lead a normal life as we do. Secondly, noone has the right to look at anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of privacy. To sum up, famous people are the same as we are, and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to break into their privacy. Therefore, I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. ",38.00
905," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for the letter which I have received with a great delight and excitement. I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have required. First of all, I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and I believe the weather would be best for camping in July. And if it is possible I would like to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I find tents uncomfortable to sleep in. The two activities I would like to do at the Camp are Tennis and surfing. I have been playing Tennis for many years and it is my favourite sport. However, I have never done surfing before but I have always wanted to learn how to do it and I believe this would be my best chance to do so. Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies. Also the amount of money I need to bring (is there any shops). And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like. Thank you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who does art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school. When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert. We were all given different sort of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers. It was the best day of my life and certainly for others, too. I wish you were there. It was fantastic. I will be looking forward to your reply. Love from ",40.0
535," I'm very please to recived these prize. Thank you very much. The only time I can travel to  U.S.A is in July, because that is the only time I can leave my work. Other worker are taking on other month so there is only July that is availible for me. About the accommodation at Camp California, I would like to stay in a tents. I'm a very out door person, who like to go camping and hiking, so staying in a tents is like a second home to me. The two activities that I could like to do are Tennis and Climbing. I'm very good at tennis, and I was a profeshional tennis player. I won the U.S. Open and the French open in 1986 and 1988. Unforgivly, my climbing skill is no where like my tennis skill, but I alway love climbing. I'm afrade of hights and eversince I alway want to conqure that fear! At this point, I would like to know which air line I will be traveling in and if it  possible can you send me more information about the Camp California. Also I would like to know how long I will be staying at this camp so I can prepare how much money I'm going to need and how many clothes I'm going to take. I would like to thank you again for the prize that you give me.  [SEP]  Filming about life at school mean filming  students acts and behaveare. We need to show what students interests in and which subject  are interested . I think Science are one of the interesting subject in school. It is very interesting and fun with the experement. Lot and lot of experements which give out quit an interest and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life. We can see a lot of interest faces on the students wile we  filming them. Also it  not a very easy subject so we can capture other students faces in confuse and puzzal. Also drama is one of the most fun and interest subject. We can see students expressing their feeling, wonderful and excitting story that the student made up or from a will know story. Another excitting subject which most of the students likes very much is P.E. Many students like to play sports. (I'm one of them). It  a good idea to have that in. Plus you can use me as a main person because I'm very good at it. We can also film life after school. After school activities is one of the main thing in school. There are lot of interest activities doing on such as, painting, swimming, football, basketball, reading, drama, and much much more. We can capture bits of each activities and used it as a finish clips for our film.  ",31.0
789," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writting to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition. I would like also with the present to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip. First of all, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to give examinations for the First Certificate in English. Furthermore, in August I will be preparing for my course at the University which I am starting next September. Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accomodation in log cabins as I am not used on living in the countryside and especially  in tents. In addition, I would like to inform you that I  prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I will be at the Camp, as I am an active member of  Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills. I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need. I would like also  to specify if the food is including in the prize. Please let me know if you need more information. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  As requested, I visited some classes during the lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place. The aim of this report is make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed. It's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory, because our laboratory is new, recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors, and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped. In addition, I think you have to take also plans from the school's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children, and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good. I think also that  will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background. In conclusion, I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help to this short video by all means. ",32.0
1062," Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing  you in relation to our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March. First at all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday. On the other hand, our class has recently read an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th. This show is a good opportunity to know the latest fashions in several topics like make up, Hairstyles and leisure and sports wear. We think that it could be a great chance in order to know British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies. We would like to know if it could be possible to introduce a little change in our programme. Our question is: instead of going to the shopping on Tuesday, in the afternoon, could we go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show? I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing your reply. Yours sincerely, Classroom 5  [SEP]  How will be our future homes? Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason of all of this things is the impressionable introduction of the ""new technologies"", such as Computers,  Internet or WAP technologies. Of course, this new facilities will be introduced at home. Now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by the computer, and this opption, in the next  years, will become the most common once. The new technologies probably will produce a considerably revolution in some essencial parts of the house. For example, we will have got computerizated ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have got central heating controled through  Internet from our office. Despite all of this facilities, there are some home activities that will remain the same, fortunately. Who don't like to prepare a cup of tee with traditional kettles, waiting for the boiling watter? And to read the newspaper at breakfast instead of watching TV? Some pleasures must be untouchable! We are human beings at least, not ""new technological"" machines! ",32.00
911," Dear Ms Ryan Helen, thank you for the information, I am glad I've won first prize! I would like to go in July for it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accomodation I  prefer to live in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to attend to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to join the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities on two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing. I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to be aware of what clothes I should take. Another thing I am interested in is general information of prices in the USA. I would greatly appreciate your soonest answer. Yours sincerely E. Sidorov.  [SEP]  I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good,  probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrances of it! ",38.0
657," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you to give you some further information about the competition I won. I am very pleased that I won your competition. First of all I would like to travel in July because I already made an arrangement with my boss about my free days. I would prefer to sleep in an log cabin. I am not just to sleeping in an tent and I think it mabey ruen my holiday. I hope it's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it's not, you can also put me in an tent. The two activities I would like to choose are: Photography and Surfing. Photography I never realy took  pratice in, yes I have made some holiday pictures but I would like to learn more about this. So I am not very good in Photography. Surfing is my passion. I live nearby a beach and whenever I have the time I grape my bord and go surfing. I would like to have a surfing contest with other surfing nerds, if it's possible. I would like to know if I have to bring my own wetsuit for surfing and how much money do you think I need? I am realy looking forward to this holiday. I hope I have informed you enough. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? I'm doing great esspecially after my experience with helping at  pop concert. It was fantastic. You also would have liked  very much. I had to help back stages. I had to take care of that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone elses. Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted. The realy thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost. That was a good feeling for me. I had to tell them when they had to go on stages. What kind of clothes they shoot wear. I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous. The thing I realy liked, was helping the artists and talking to them. Oke, they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert. Afterwards they talk to me and thanking me for helping them in those exciting moments. I realy got to know them after the concert. They also took me to a after hour party and they asked me if  would like to do this again. And of course I immediately said Yes!! Mabey next time you can come with me that would be a lot of fun. The will call me next week, so I write when I talk to them. Talk to you soon. love ",29.0
723," 13th June 2000 Dear Helen Ryan, First of all, I would like to thank you and your organisation for giving me this opportunity. I've just received your letter this morning. I am very happy an exciting about it. I can only travel during July because I have many A-levels examinations to take during June. I would prefer staying in a tent because I haven't done it before and I would like to give it a go. I also would like to chose basketball and surfing as two activities to do while I am at the Camp. I am very keen on basketball. I am a captain of  school's basketball team and we have won many competitions. However, my surfing skill is very average as I have only been surfing for three months. There are two questions I would like to ask. First question is how many and what type of clothes do I have to take with me? Another question is how much money do I have to take with me (roughly)? I am really looking forward to take part at Camp California. Yours sincerely, Duangkamol (Denis) Saowaluk  [SEP]  13th June 2000 Dear Kim, How are you? I am fine. Remember I have told you that I have been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band? Well, it turned out really well and everybody had a great time. It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage. I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert, so I tried as well as I could. I didn't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea of the background of the stage was my, and I am very proud of it. Everything has been finally planed two days before the concert. On Saturday night, the concert began. Everything went really well, the music was great and the fans were loving it. When they've finished singing the last song I was surprice when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people. I am sure that I'll never forget that moment.

798," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California, so I am writing to you to indicate  my preferences for the travel and the accomodation. I have no particular needs but one: it will be necessary for me to travel in July because my work will keep me very busy in all  other months. About the accomodation, I have no problems, but I would prefer staying in  tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous. During the holiday, I would like playing tennis and golf. I can play tennis quite well, but I have never played golf, so, if it is possible, I would like taking lessons with a teacher. I would like to know also what I will have to pay  with my money and how the climate is at Camp California, because I have to decide which clothes to bring. I look forward to your answer. Yours sincerely, Clara Mancini  [SEP]  People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes. A man usually is less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay  what his wife has bought. In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the contrary, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when there is a lot of crowd. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend a hour to buy some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other. The better thing to do to skip queues and crowd is not to go shopping on Saturdays, but it is not always possible. ",31.0

Secondly, the time  in your advertisement told that it should start  19:30, but it did not start before 20.15 And then about the tickets, you wrotte that they were discounts available but they were not. Finaly when we had seen the Musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they done some dekoreting, and you wrott in your advertisement ""Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"" We are very disappointed, it was not a perfect evening out for us, therefore we would  have your money back. I  looking forwart to hear from you. Yours faithfully, HELGAR Svessen,  [SEP]  Clothes in the future Clothes is  very interesting subjekt to study. If you travlling around you can see  lot of different still from different culture. At first I think that in the future we are going to wear less clothes because the climet are being warmer and warmer. Secondly I think we have more mixing clothes from all over the world, because we are traveling more and more around. And that is nice if you can pick up the best thing from all over the world, but on the other hand it is not so nice if every country wear  some type of clothes. Finaly about my oppinion I wish we are going to dress us more as  in the past with nature matrial, we most think more about the eviorment and leave closer to the earth. ",20.0

I am very greatfull and I want to thank you very much for letting me do this trip. I think it is very kind of yous to ask me what my preferences are for the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel  the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays starts. Answering another of your questions, I am more likely  to stay in a log cabin considering that I will be to weeks in the camp. They are much more confortable than tents. While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing. I have not done any of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it. I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes should I take, and how much money do you think I will need to bring with me. I want to thank you again for letting me have this unique experience. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.  [SEP]  Dear Kim; How are you? I's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Anyways, do you remember my last e-mail, where I told you that I was going to help at a Pop Concert. Well, I'm going to tell you about that awesome experience. The band played at my school so we could raise money for our graduation trip. I asked them if they could play at our school and they told me it would be 350 pounds. ""The Moicznos"" are so popular that we sold our every ticket and end up wining 2000 pounds. Appart from calling them, I also helped building up the stage, and took care of the lights. After the concert the whole class helped cleaning up the mess the people left. I can tell you that it was a wonderfull experience. What I liked the most about it is not the fact that we raised a lot of money, but that we enjoyed of an amazing show in which I took  active part. The band thanked me very much for calling them and having everything so well organized. I hope you liked reading my story. Hope to hear from you soon. Love, ",34.0

I waited quite one hour to see the show, and what happened with the actor? I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear, it was another one. There is more! Where were the discounts that I should have earned? I was very disappointed with that! After the show my sun wanted to eat some biscuits and when I see the restaurant closed, I gave up, I told to my sun that we'll never come back here again. The restaurant was closed because there wasn't  electricity you should close the theatre untill the restaurant get appropriate to use. I was totaly unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if it's possible. I thank you for read my letter, I hope you write for me back, and don't forget my money!  [SEP]  I am writing what I think what kind of clothes will people wear 100 years from now . As we see the clothes are changing every hour. People  inventing new kinds of clothes and people  buying and wearing differents clothes. It is difficult to say how people will be wearing clothes 100 years from now. In each country, each people wear differents kinds of clothes, like, people in Brazil wear shorts, T-shirts or only without them, in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes, if you analyse   the point of view  who doesn't live in Saudi Arabia. I'm quite sure that people in all   world will be wearing very differents clothes in the future because , especialy women,  like to be very elegant and beautiful will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.

45," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing about  International Arts Festival which I went to recently. I had a great time there because taking a place the kind of festival in my town is very unusual. I think that  International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price. In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about. Firstly, there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year. Therefore, there will be more people coming  the concerts. Finally, food shops should be added in this festival in next year because only plays and films were not atrractive enought to get audiences. I would be grateful if you could consider my opinion above, Yours sencirely,  [SEP]  Dear Karrie, Hello. How are you doing? I've been also considering rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out wheneve I want, even in the mid-night. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home. There is a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite  unusual rule in  Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't  make up on at school at all. I want to at least put lip coluor on. I wish I could change this rule. I'll be grade if you let me know about your rules at school and at home. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best wishes. ",26.00
395," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the service you'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre. I've read your advertisement and it didn't say the truth. There weren't any discount available as you'd assured  in the add. I think you should check the information before print it! I arrived at the right time (19.30) that evening but the play, which was 'Over The Rainbow', started almost an hour later. And nobody told me why! When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one wasn't good at all. I couldn't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations. Why didn't you say something about it? I didn't have the 'perfect evening out' you'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible. Please answer my letter as soon as possible. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Marcella, Scalia C.  [SEP]  'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life?' This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain  you how . I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games. When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial to do my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job. One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one. I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't survive. The modern technology is better now than what it used to be. What do you think about this? I'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view, haven't they? Now I would like to have your point of view. ",28.0
65," Dear Ms. Jane Clark, I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held  21st and 22nd November. I went to the rock concert by U2 and  the Chinese film ""Chung King Express"". Both of them were not only really enjoyable, but also reasonably-priced. However, I feel that it would be even better if there were some improvement. First of all, it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities. Because most of them were from English speaking country this year. In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars. Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase. I think they are the nearest 'arts' in real life. I would be glad if you consider my suggestions. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problem for students? Of course, you can't afford a luxualy car and a large apartment unless you've born with a silver spoon. However, there are some good ways for you to earn enough money to enjoy yourself. How about working as a waiter or waitress? Not only it's a simple job, but also you can enjoy working with many colleague at your age. It would be great fan to make friends outside your class or club. If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher. It's also  really popular job among university students because of the good salaly. If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough, you'll probably become an excellent teacher. Stop complaining about  lack of money and let's start working to have a new world. You'll find that your life is becoming more and more enjoyable! ",24.00
87," Dear Sir, I'm writing to you to complain about my deceiveful experience at your theatre last Saturday night. What I thought it was going to be a wonderful night became into the worst night at the theatre I've ever had. Firstly, I must admit that when we realised the main character had been changed we felt really disappointed. This is because I had been waiting to enjoy Danny Brook's performance since I saw him the first time on television. Secondly, despite of your advertisement of the possibility of discounts, when I showed my student identity card to one of your employes she angrily told me that I had to pay the whole prize. Moreover, not only had the actor been changed but also the musical show started forty five minutes late. In my opinion you ought to be more serious because of the commitent you have  with the people who comes to your theatre. Finally, at the end of the night we felt a bit hungry but we couldn't eat until  arriving home due to your restaurant new cooker illness. The truth is the night wasn't my perfect night out as you have announced so I would appreciate  if you could give  my money back. I wait to receiving a prompt answer from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had always thought that I could rely on her whatever my problem was. Yet, one extremly hot day while I was pacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems I discovered my elder brother's girlfriend with another boy. At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I run to my brother in order to explain him what I had seen. Nevertheless, when I found him studying harder for his final exams I realised I would rather her girlfriend explained my poor brother the truth. But the thing is I needed to speak to someone about the fact so I could feel more relaxed. I didn't know who explain it to but actually I decided that if I needed to tell someone a secret I would trust an my best friend Pat. So, the next day, I nervously came to Pat's appartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen. After that, she felt completely sad because of the love she had been feeling for my brother for several years and she swore  me that she was going to tell it to nobody. However, the truth was that not sooner had I arrived home than my brother asked me crying why I had told his girlfriend's affair to Pat instead of discovering him the truth. ",31.0
1030," DECEMBER 12TH PRINCIPAL MR. ROBERTSON DEAR SIR, I WANT TO THAK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US TO THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH. IT CONSISTS ON VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IN THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF  ENGLISH LANGUAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN THE MORNING AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE AFTERNOON FREE WE COULD GO TO THE FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. I WILL BE WRITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR RESPONSE. YOURS FAITHFULLY  [SEP]  (FAMOUS PEOPLE, SUCH AS POLITICIANS AND FILM STARS, DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME) FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION. AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ACT IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND OF INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAYS. THIS SITUATION AFFECTS FAMOUS PERSONAL LIVES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE  PRIVACY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS, THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE FAMOUS  RIGHT TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES IN SECRET. IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT IN SOME CASS, COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY. ",28.00
423," Dear Sir or Madam, I'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW. Regarding your advertisement, it is the LONDON'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW, but I was deeply disappointed at it. According to your advertisement, the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE. I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings, but at the day I saw it, a different actor played. He was not DANNY BROOK. Moreover there was no discount ticket. They were all sold out. You should have said they were very few. I had to buy a £20 ticket. To make matters worse, the time that the show started was delayed. It started at 20:15, fourty five minutes later! That's why I couldn't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show. It had already closed, when the show finished. I'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night. Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. yours faithfully  [SEP]  Modern technology has changed my life. Especially, a computer has made my daily life change dramatically.  It is only two or three years since I  have used a computer at home, but now I wonder how I can live without it. I open my e-mail box every night. When I find a new message, I'm very happy. Before using e-mail, I used to write letters and sometime  telephon. However I've found e-mail is better than them. Because as soon as I send my message, they can receive it. In the other word, I can also receive their reply soon. It's really useful, when I need  quick reply. Overmore when I send e-mail, I need not worry about the time. I can send them anytime I like. Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day. ",31.0
1029," 1st. March, 2000 Dear Mr. Robertson, Thank you for organising the programme about the trip to London. There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and especially they are looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting  National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London. The students in my class have just seen the advertisement for a show in today's edition of The Times. There will be The London Fashion and Leisure Show in Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March. It starts  10:00 am and finishes  9:00 p.m. All of my classmates would like to go there because it is a great chance to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Besides, students don't have to pay  entrance fee because it is free for students. The fashion show is only on the 14th of March, so I would be grateful if you could allow all of my classmates to go there after visiting  Science Museum instead of going shopping. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Many people think that it is natural for famous people to be followed by journalists all the time because they are famous and everybody is curious about their life. However, in my opinion, famous people, such as politicians and film actors, deserve to have a private life. First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time. Another reason that I agree  famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was  ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death. To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media. ",30.00
1041," Dear Mr Robertson, I'd like thank you  to take us on a trip to London and have made such a good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich. It also will be ""The London fashion and leisure show"" on the 14th of March, which consist on an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. Indeed it will be free for us as we are students. As you know we are in England to learn your language and also  your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country! May I suggest an alternative ? We could go to  science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery . We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would leave us go to  show on tuesday, because we can use the wednesday's free time to do our shopping. I hope that my idea sweet you and you'll agree. Sincerely,  [SEP]  Tuesday, 12th December Dear Annette, Thank you for your letter, like usual, it's a pleisure to receive a word from you. I understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present, and you'd like give to him a book, which, I think, it's a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastique book, which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories. It's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties. I recone that it's quite not an easy reading, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's such good in litteracy, that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personnality. It'll be a good point for her general culture, Wuthering Heights it's a classic, which everybody knows about it, even if they didn't have read it, they, at liest, know the story. Let me know what would be your choice. Love from, ",24.00
547," Dear Mrs. Ryan, Thank you for your letter. I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition. First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July, because I will work in August in a web designer studio. So I am unable to go on holiday to another time. I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like camping very much. I think it's more exciting to be in a tent than in a log cabin. I was very surprised that you offer such a great variety of sports and courses. I would like to do Basketball and Painting. I played Basketball at school for about two years. I am rather good in it. I also had Painting as  main subject at school for five years. I like painting very much, and I think I am good in Painting. I paint a lot in my free time. I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy-pictures. I would like to ask you, how much money will we need? Which clothes should we take with us? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  First I would like to point out, that this was a good idea to present our school in a short film. I think first of all we should film an english lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information-boards. I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson, maybe the pupils could write ""offers and orders"" or enquiries on the blackboard. Next I would film a BWPM lesson. This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations. They go together in groups, then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers. It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake. The smokers in the school yard, the buffett and the other pupils, who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework. I think then we should film an informatic-lesson. It would be funny to present the computers, which are often overcharged, or often the netserver is spinning. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text, while the computers do not work or brake down. I think that would be all for our video. In my opinion this are the most interesting things in our school. ",29.0
618," Dear Ms Ryan I'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the  first prize in your competition and I'm looking forward to spend the two weeks at Camp California. Just because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July. This is the month that best suits me. The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip. I would rather sleep in a log cabin. I find it will be much more comfortable than a tent. The leisure activities sound fantastic especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I've joined a climbing group in my town  2 years  and  reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience on it but I wish I'd learn a lot. However, there are some questions that I want to ask you about. Do I need  passport to travel? What kind of clothes would be appropriate, winter or summer? Are there any food service at the camp? I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily life video at school. The activities suggested are write below. The opening time recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in could be a good begining. It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning. Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and speaking either theory lessons or practice would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons. Why don't  include some sports, for example, voleyball? The team has been training very hard during  last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being at the video. The musical lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video. I think that if we mix lessons with sport activities the combination will give us complete success. ",32.0
1199," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, I am writing to give you some information  asked  in your letter, which I received this morning. Your group has been booked in  Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you would take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also. Regarding to the end-of-conference party, I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man, though, it is no  formal do. The party will finish quite late so we've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely. Basicaly, during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of  interesting places of London. However you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos. I look forward to welcoming you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Are you always happy when your telephon ring? As far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in  19th century. It has been affecting our lifes very quickly, although there were some different ways of communication as TV, for instance. Since the internet was introduced, many of us wouldn't have imagined the lifes without this. We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time. However, are you always happy when your personal phone rings. On the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wouldn't have your mobile switched on. This invention has affected my life completely. Since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without  internet or my mobile phone. In spite of having the opportunity of keeping  contact with friends at the time  we are far away from home, we should have been knowledge how to use it without interrupting others. ",29.00
732," Dear Mrs Helen Ryan, I am writing to you in reply to your letter about my willing the first prize in your competition. First of all, I would like to thank the jury for chosen my work from all the competitors. Next, I would like to find out some details about the camp. I need to know if my travel will take place in August. If I had known that I won, I would not have arranged my english course in Britain. Before. The next point is the accommodation. You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins. I would prefer staying in tents. I am very close to the nature, so it will be a pleasure for me. What's more, your letter said about the chance to do for two acctivities during the camp. I am very interested in tennis, but I am also very good at photography. It has been my hobby since I was a child. I have even won  competion once. That is why I would like to continue doing this at the camp. Finally, I would like to ask about other things like: clothes, money, guide. I would like to know if the ,,travel costs'' which you had paid for include entrance tickets to the museums' or any other cultural places, because I would like to  some sightseeing in the U.S.A. Furthermore, if there will be cmy tumple dryer or washing maschine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp. I am looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely A. Adamski.  [SEP]  Generally, most people like shopping, but there are some advantages and disadvantages. When discribing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping. It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday,  Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time. On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need. In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not. ",27.0
375," 17th June 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week holiday. While there I saw your advertisement for the show ""Over the rainbow"" and decided to go. I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, it was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available,  as it was mentionned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else. After the show was over, it was not possible to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed that day. I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you  a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed. Yours faithfuly,  [SEP]  Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say  changed it. I will take the exemple of the use of the internet. I use it on a daily basis for many different reasons: I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail through the internet and the person received it within seconds. I don't need to go to the stores anymore, if I don't want to: I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it: books, video tapes, clothes and even groceries. It is also possible to read the news or play games. I also have the possibility of making new friends: I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people. ",38.0
936," Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan. It was so great to hear that I had won first prize. It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp. I am writing to reply about your questions. I am wondering that I will be only able to travel in July, because I have to finish my first year at the university. It finishes 29th of June. In addition to this, I have already resistered  another course which starts from 2nd of August. Secondly, I would prefer living in tents, I always admire outdoors life. Finally, I would like to  surging and golf. In  case of surfing, I have never had an experience, I am  absolutely beginner. On the other hand, I used to play golf with my father. When I was 14, I won the competition. I would like to ask about Camp California. Let me know if I have to take which kind of clothes and how much money I need. It would be very helpful. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Hi. How are you? I am fine. Thanks for your letter. I want to let you know about my experience as you wanted. Well, last month, I worked at a pop concert. It was fantastic because I could see Madonna. My main job was to tide up her dressing room. Can you imagine? You are working with your idea woman, I can't still belive that I spoke with her. Anyway, the most important thing was that I had  good experience. If we had worked together we would have had a good time. It's   pity, isn't it? Now, I know how difficult  to sing in front of the audience and behind the start there are a lot of the people who help the performance. Next time, I hope that we'll work together. Let's find some information to get a job. Shall we? I have to go now. I am fed up with studying, but I have to. I hope that you'll be alright. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

1096," Dear Mr. Robertson First of all I would like to thank you for organizing this trip to London, and for taking care of the programme. It is a very good shedule, especially because you have considered different activities for us. However, we saw an advertisement, and we are keen on the idea of going to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will take place on Tuesday March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall, from 10.00 to 19.00. Personally, I think it can be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attent to, and we are all fond of the latest fashion. We noticed that it is free for students so the price of the trip will not rise. We discussed about the programme, and because the show will take the whole day, we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wenesday instead of having free time all afternoon. I am looking forward to having your answer. Yours sincerelly  [SEP]  It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. It was a new challenge, and not only for me, but for everyone there. Nobody thought I was capable of doing it. I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me, was driving me mad. Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge. I could listen the crowd shouting 'Go, Go'. That was my only chance.. Only  few more seconds, otherwise my time would be over. I didn't even think of boking down. I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all. Then, by some 'strange power' my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it, but it was too difficult. The clock was running.. tic, tac... And suddenly everything stopped. I felt an enourmous peace. Somehow I managed to jump out of the airplane and I was flying! Those minutes, up in the air, feeling the wind in my face, were fantastic....And then I was terrified when I couldn't open the parachute! Fortunatelly, I wasn't alone. ",35.00
1052," Dear Mr. Robertson, I have heard you organised such a nice programme especially  river trip and museum for our class. I would like to thank you for doing that on behalf of my classmates. By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show. It will show us the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear. In addition, make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time. We think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience. What is  better,  all students can participate without paying. It takes place at Central Exhibition hall in London. And it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of March. So we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on Tuesday instead of  Science Museum and put  science museum into free time on Wednesday. I hope you will consider our suggestion. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Much safer but still at home Our homes have change with many comfortable things compare with the past. As many inventors made lots of things, we can live in good facilites houses: But do you think no more comfortable homes will be built? Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security safety like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That is, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place. To conclude, while our homes in the future will be much safer than before, they will still have good spaces for us to be at home. ",25.00
204," Dear Manager, I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening to your theatre. and I would like to explain what the problems were. Firstly, as I read at the advertisment,  the actor would be Danny Brook and this is one of the reasons why I came to the theatre. But at  big suprise  I saw that the actor was different and I was very disappointed. Secondly, on the article the times were 14:30 and 19:30. I prefered to come at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the theatre started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting  to start. Another reason why I was disappointed was that you said there would be  discount available but there wasn't. At last I was waiting to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken. This was very disappointing. As you can see there were many problems with the theatre and I would like to ask for some money back as an alternative Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The next morning at school everybody was looking at me with a strange way. Nobody was talking to me except the ten persons who I invited to my party. At first I didn't know why but after a few seconds I realised that telling Pat about my party wasn't a good idea. I was very ungry with her, I didn't know what to do I was afraid that I would have lost all my friends. After a few seconds of thoughts I went straigh to Pat. ""Why, why did you do that?"" I said she looked as if she didn't want to talk to me. I ignored her I couldn't do anything now. Everybody knew about my party and I had invited only ten persons. I was confused. I wondered why I made the mistake  to invite Pat. I guess I didn't know that she would have said it. After a big confusion I decided not to make a party for my birthday so I could had all my friends back. And that's what I had exactly done even if I stayed alone at my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back. With this story I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends and who you can trust. ",33.0
1182," Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter. Surely I'll try to help you as good as I can. First, I  tell you the name of the hotel, it's the Palace Hotel. Fortunately, it is not far from our college. For getting from the hotel to the conference, you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College, where the conference will take place. About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest I still don't know  will be expected. I suggest to wear casual clothes, I think there's no need of school uniforms. To answer your last question, I would propose you to attend the local zoo, because many baby animals were born in the past few days. Dear Mrs Smith, I hope the given information is useful for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The telephone Could you imagine there's no telephone ringing in an office? Or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend? Could you? I can't! The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century. It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in  future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately. When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village. Now I have my own flat, and the first piece of furniture I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home. ",34.00
125," Lausanne, the 20th of May 2000 Dear M. Smith, My name is Marie Bouchard, I come from Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend. On Thursday, the 3rd of May 2000, we went to your theatre to see ""Over the rainbow"". Unfortunately, we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre. Firstly, we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts as it's written on your advertisement . Surprisily, there were no discounds. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!! Thirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement? In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!! Nothing was serious. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful. I sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back. In advance, thank you. I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre. Sincerely yours  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When her best friend, Scala, asked her  an idea to surprise her husband  because she's pregnant, Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala's husband got the surprise. The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village. She's a secretary in an office. Everybody knows everybody. Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husband  too. It was a Friday suny afternoon, Scala was really excited  to tell her the new. Despite  she knew that Pat couldn't keep  secret but for this time she was confident  maybe too. Just after Scala told her the new, Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery, to tell  that Scala is pregnant. As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came & bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said ""Congratulations for the new baby."" He was so amazed and asked  to repeat . She just thought it would be a secret,  she came really embarassed. When he went back to his house, his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it wasn't a surprise! Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret. ",25.0
225," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complaine about the evening at the Circle Theatre presenting ""Over the Rainbow"". It wasn't at all like what the advertisement for the show had promised. I will try to explain below: To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well. Then, they were not any discounts available for the tickets as it was written on the advertisement. What's more the theatre restaurant was closed for some reasons and we couldn't get anything to drink or eat after the show. On top of everything Danny Brook, the star of the night, was absent and his role was performed by a different actor. You can understand how disappointing this was for all of us. I am sorry but this wasn't my perfect evening out. I would like to ask for some refund because the whole evening was very disappointing and it did not worth the money given Yours faithfully  [SEP]  As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes rootly through the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be like 100 years from now In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns to be stricher and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too. This is how I think  fashion of the future will be like. The most exciting  about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange  as we don't think about ours . ",30.0
282," Dear Sir, Last Saturday evening me and my family went to see the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at your theatre. I'm writing this letter to express the reasons of our disappointment about that evening. The advertisement for the show said that there was discounts available for children so we brought them and when we bought the tickets we had to pay the maximum price for everyone. Then, when we got in, we had to wait because the show started forty-five minutes late. By then our children were very bored. My husband was looking for to seeing his favourite actor, Danny Brook, and when the show started he found out that Brook had been changed by a different actor. My husband was really unhappy. When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack to the theatre restaurant and it was closed without  giving any reason for it. As you can see, it wasn't the evening we expected and the result was very different from the promises you made in the advertisement. I think it would be reasonable if we could have our money back. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as succesful as we thought. My and my friends, including Pat, were preparing a surprise for Sam's birthday. We decided to go to his place (I've got a copy of the key) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounch, then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived. Everybody was excited about the idea and we were keeping it in secret in front of Sam. Two days before the event Carol, Albert, Sam and me went to visit Pat in her house and she invited us to stay for dinner. We were having a wonderful time chatting and laughing but suddenly the phone rang and Pat answer it. It was her aunt inviting her  for the weekend so Pat said very loudly: ""I'm sorry but I have to go to Sam's flat and decorate it, it's a surprise, don't tell anybody"" Sam look at us surprised and said ""What's going on?"" Everybody had to change  plans and the party became a normal party. We were a bit disappointed but we enjoyed  anyway. ",36.0

669," 13th June 2000 Dear Mrs Ryan Regarding your letter dated on the 6th of June I'm so happy to receive the first price. Thanks very much. I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school on this time. Although, the accommodation isn't so important for me. I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed. I have choosen the activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner on both activities. I have some questions as follow: 1. What kind of clothes are needed? 2. What  I have to pay by myself? 3. Should I take some money with me? 4. How is the wheather in California? I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerelly, A. Becker  [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable. There are a lot of reasons  that could be awful to go shopping. Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find. I had once this problem. I was looking for a special fruit. The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice and helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as ,,customer treat with order"". Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful. He wanted everything what his eyes saw. All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfy  the store. The shops have bad opening times. When I feel me comfortable for shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around. My conclusion on these points are not so bad. I like shopping at all with my best friend.

525," Dear Sir/Madam, I would like to point out the problems  when I went to watch your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at the Circle Theatre. On your advertisement, you have written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I have expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing. Also, the times printed on your advertisment was 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late. On your advertisment, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available. I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and on your advertisment, it made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting. However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated. It was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisment said it would be, and I would like some refund back. I hope you would give these problems your immediate attention. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind  not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever? When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends. I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce. When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day,  to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse. However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and  told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager. My happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car. The news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover. I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now. I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret. ",39.0
464," To the manager of the Circle Theatre in London I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London a few time ago. I had enjoied to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago; and the actor's Danny Brook performance. I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but, with my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain here until the end because I  left London, with my group before the end of the show. The star, the actor Danny Brook, there wasn't in the musical show but there was an other actor, with my great disappoint. Then, in the program I could read  a discount available for the tickets, for the groups, but I couldn't have that. I couldn't have all the things I expected. That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied about your informations and I ask  some money back. I hope in your answer and in your explanation about this. Your Sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Some days ago, when the school was ending, Pat and her friends decided to make a party for their friend, Frances, because the end of the school  and the Francis's birthday were  the same day. That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided  the program and the present, a new gold watch. Peter and Sue asked to Francis  some help for their exam's subjets and Francis, for to help them, was very busy all the week. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments,   tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this. In the afternoon she had phoned at a Francis's mother and she explained her the secret, then she phoned at her best friend and she speak about that too; she phoned at many people all the day. Now many people knew the secret but Pat said everyone: ""I  tell you a small secret, but you don't speak , please!"" In the night Francis was invited to the party, at Pat's home. When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner, a his friend, ask him if he was very happy about his present, the new gold watch, he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends. The Francis's secret was discovered! Now all the Pat's friend don't tell her about their secrets because Pat isn't very good at keeping secrets.  ",23.0
315," Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" I went to see at your theatre in London two weeks ago. According to your advertisement, Danny Brook was involved in the show, but to my disappointment there was a different actor. To make things worse, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Besides, there was a problem with tickets. According to the advertisement, discounts were available, but in reality it wasn't so! On top of everything, when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, it turned out to be closed. When I insisted on the explanation of this fact, I was told that the chief cook was on holiday! The perfect evening out you promised to provide turned  to be really boring and disappointing. In connection with this I think you should give me some money back. I hope you will  note  this and I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat was my classmate and I should add, that he was one of my best friends. I loved and respected him very much, but there was an unpleasant thing about him - he talked too much. My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising to her, because she could hardly ever think of such a present. We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the holiday probably even more impatiently, than Susie. But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret. He told her about the present as soon as he saw her. I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited, that he couldn't act in a different way. Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but  friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending. ",35.0
672," Dear Mrs Ryan, I am writing in reply to your letter asking for further information from me. First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beggining of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes. Besides, I would preffer to stay in  tents, because I got used to being in tents since each summer I spent my holidays with my friends at the hills. In adittion, I would rather playing tennis. When I was younger I won the National Tennis Championship. I also like surfing, I think it is a dangerous sport, but I know how to practice it, because of the fact that last year a proffessional surfer tought me. However, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take and if it is possible for you to tell me how much money I will need. I would appreciate it if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special good you never find it. Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products, that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else. I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that it really become tiring. To summarize, I could say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then, go shopping. If not shopping  never be enjoyable, but also tiring and boring.

1044," Dear Mr Robertson, Thank you for the programme which you have organised  the three days in London. However, some students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to have an opportunity to go to the show. The show is opened between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday, March 14 at  Central Exhibition Hall in London. Latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied. We have concerned it as a great opportunity to touch a part of  latest cultures, which are concentrated and sharpened in London. In addition, the addmission for students is free. Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that in  free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion. Yours sincerily,  [SEP]  The ways of living are always changing. It is no doubt that  functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation, for example, have been. Thinking about the home of the future, first of all, nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies, which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for  convenient life. People may tend to avoid from living in a large number of families in an expected small house in a city. On the other hand, the bond between parents and children should be unlikly to change. People always need their parents, children and so on. The longer and further they live on their own, the more they may feel that they need a family. New materials will surly change the home of the future in any ways. It is just staff's around us improving and turning into new one. Hopefully, the minds of people will stay peaceful and tender in the future. ",24.00
702," Dear Mrs Ryan, I have just received your letter and feel happy about winning first prize. I am now writing to give you all  information you require. First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June. On August I am going to apply for a new job. Also, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than stay in a tent. From my point of view, log cabins are more comfortable. Another consideration are  activities. I enjoy playing basketball and golf. Also I think I am good at singing and at dancing. I would be most greatful if you could let me know some information: - How  to get to Camp California from  airport? - How far from  city-centre the camp is situated? - How much money  I have to take with me? - What is the weather in California in July? - What kind of clothes would you recommend me to bring with me? - Are there leisure and intertainments facilities close to the camp? I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Report To: Mr Clark From: Sonya Volavkova Attituds to the video about life at our school Introduction:- The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's attituds about  video they have to be made and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed.

1089," Dear Mr Robertson I am writing to request your permission for us to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show on 14th March. First of all, I would like to say thank to you for this good programme, especially  the decision of going to visit in London. All of us is appreciated that we could have this opportunity. Because most students have never been to London before, also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go . However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show additionally. This show takes place at  Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. In this show, not only can we see  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, but we also can enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you would accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Nowadays, quite a few famous people suffer  their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters. I would like to think how  media effect to famous people. Few years ago, we had a terrible news of  death of Lady Diana. She was always been aftering by  media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after chasing for  long time, she was dead because of  car accident. It must be a good example of  media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen. Human right must be existed for all people. On the other hand, there are  few famous people  desire to be watched by  media. If  media stopped focusing  the people, they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish. Moreover, many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or  in a magazine. It is one  of fun in our life. On balance, ",24.00
1094,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing  you because I had been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme your have organised to our English class travel. First of all, thank you for the programme, we think it is very good, especially the river trip to greenwich, we believe we will enjoy  a lot going to greenwich. Moreover, in our opinion, this travel is going to be very interesting for us. On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we would all like to go the show. We think it is a good opportunity because london fashion is the most important over the world, and we all learn a lot about London style going to this show. We think we could change  shooping  for going to the show. The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March. It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there on the afternoon. Thank you for your attention. We are looking forward to your answer, Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Thinking about the media's treatment of famous people, I've realised of some things. On my point of view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad. The media's are looking forward to create great expectations about famous people. They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public. On the other hand, if the media's are acting in that way  is because of the society. The society  is who increases the audience of the media, if nobody gave attention to the famous people private lifes, this treatment would finish. But in my opinion, before you get famous you know which are the consequences. As in another  you may know what could happen. To sum up, there is no job perfect, and be famous involves a lof  money, but also a lot of jouralists following your private life. ",27.00

I am glad that you offer for accommodation not only  tents but also  log cabins. Because I am a light sleeper and have problems with my back I prefer to sleep in a log cabin with a comfortable bed. Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do Singing and Surfing. It is difficult to say how good I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad. I never did Surfing in my life but I am a very good Snowboarder and this could be an advantage. I hope I gave you all  informations you need. There is something I  like to know from you.

Yours sincerely Rosalinde Schulz  [SEP]  Dear Kim Last saturday evening I spent a wonderful time. The motor bike club of our town organized a pop concert. A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment. The only thing I had to do was solving the different problems of the guests and just being there if they have any questions. Some people came from Germany some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A. Talking English with the people from England or the U.S.A. was wonderful. They were all very kind and with some of them I spent the rest of the evening and also the following day. That I reached a lot of money for doing something I like very much was very nice but the most important thing for me was meeting people, having fun and using the English language. I will never forget this evening. Love, Rosalinde Schulz ",35.0
80," 16/12/2000 Dear Jane Clark, First of all, I'd like you to know that the whole organization was nearly excellent. I spent two nice days at the festival full of art. The idea of making the festival ""international"" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small.  Plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows made  sight for our sour eyes, they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas,  their life styles by talking to them. Beyond all these, the application of joining  all  activities by one nice-priced ticket was excellent; because it saved you from  buying one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and others,  also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect. Thank you for making a great festival which made all the art activities come together. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Jennifer, I'm glad that everything's going on well there. It's the same here. I've got too many exams nowadays, but that's all. By the way, it would be better If you wrote quite often to me. The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very diciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours. I understand the second part, but I can't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only. Do we become the ""perfect one"" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much more free at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want at my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them. Don't ever forget to write to me, okay? Love, ",31.00
1063," Wawsaw, 12th December 2000 Dear Mr Robertson, First of all, we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderfull trip with an interesting program. We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich, the town we were always interested in. However, there are may other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London. For example, in the time of our visit there is going to be ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"". It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage on. This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authograps from. We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems. Our suggestion is to visit  Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long. We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time. The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and beside  that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else. Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy. I personally think the best  would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for authopraps. Like in the zoo. The biggest commercial gain in history I believe, but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way. On the other hand, they must have done something to become famous. It may in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it. To sum up, I believe that everyone has the right to keep  privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life. Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers, journalists and photographers, famous people will just have to get use to this living ""under a microscope"".

It contains a wide range of activities for example, sightseeing,  river trip, visiting  science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admit for free. All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up, so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like. It would be grateful if you give a little change in  programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.  [SEP]  Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many times on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an off the light.  Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary. From my point of view, people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. Computer might know better than  human, but there are many things which it can not replace in our life. ",32.00
207," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to complain about the musical show I went  last week. I spent a week's holiday in London and I had been looking forward to watching a wonderful show in your theatre. However, I was completely disappointed with that. Firstly, although I bought a ticket for 19:30 the show started at 20:15. It would never happen in my country I must say. Secondly, there was no discounts despite you showed it was available in your advertisement. Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on the strike. On top of everything, the main cast, Danny Brook, did not appear on the show. The actor who played instead of him was terrible. In fact, I expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffured. I trust you will give an immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory responce in return of post within a week. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  When we think about clothes in the future, we should think about the enviroment first. What will it be like in 2100? It is not pleasant to say the earth is now facing some serious problems. But it is the fact. Air-pollution might become more serious than now in the future and  destruction of  ozon-zone could not be stopped in 100 years. Considering these elements, we should wear clothes which can protect us from certain kind of sun rays and air pollution. I suppose they would be like a arm-suits. Of course, technologies will have developped enough  to invent new material for those kind of clothes. So we don't have to worry about how heavey they will be. We will feel as if we put on nothing. In conclusion, clothes after 100 years will not  as fashionable as they are now. We should consider wearing as in more practical way. ",28.0
263," Dear Madam or Sir I am writing this letter to complain  how terrible the show performed in your theatre was. I was interested in the advertisement about the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago. However, I cannot help saying that it was really  nightmare. Firstly, you advertised that Danny Brook, who is the my favorite, is a main-actor but there was another actor insted of him. Furthermore, his performance was really poor. Secondly, it started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes later than on time and there was no discount for the ticket, which is different from the advertisement. Thirdly, the only one restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovating it. As a result, I had a totally disappointing evening during my holiday. So, I hope that you should have my money back. I will looking forward to your reply. Yours faithfully, TYUNG, SURIPHAT  [SEP]  It is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days. But how  it affect to my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of  radio program not the sound of  alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. In the bus or even in the tube, I can talk with a friend with a mobile phone when I feel boaring. Sometimes I even do some games with it. In accordance with study or work, I use a internet, which is the easist way to get informations  all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects a lot to my daily life as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the amount of it's affection to the human life would be more than this in the future. ",28.0
181," Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre: I'm writing to you to explain some problems about your theatre's show, first I have to say to you that there was a different actor  starring  the act. I expect that starring the act was Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the hour that the act started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour. About the prize, the paper that I have at home tells that there were discounts availables, if these discounts are true I couldn't use them. When the show had finished I couldn't visit the restaurant of the theatre because it was closed. The reason they gave us, was that they hadn't got any waiters. For all those reasons I give to you, I ask for the money I had payed to you back. In my opinion it wasn't my perfect evening out. I'm sorry if I make any problem to you, but I'm very angry and it was your fault. Thank you for your attention,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was fourteen-year-old and I was with my bestfriend, Pat. We were in a private school, that looks like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted that we became good and polite girls. The life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to get funny in there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school, this path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought that was  good idea told to Pat because we could use  to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told to her, she promised to me that she  kept the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic and secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told to a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story like a bad experience.  ",21.0
312," The Circle Theatre 17th Jun 2000 Dear Sir and Madam I am writing this letter to want you to know that what I think about the musical show which you (The Circle Theatre) present. I bought  group ticket for the show. Because we were 7 people. I saw ""discount available"" in the advertisement. When I asked something about  ""discount"", your staf said that it is impossible. I ignored it. Becouse I wanted to see this show. Becouse my favorite actor plays in it. We went to the theatre bulding at 18:30. We waited to start the show  about one hour and fourty-five minutes. The show started late ( about 45 min.) We were bored and we wished that this is  last mistake During the show, we couldn't see Danny Brook who is my favorite actor. An other one played in the show. We were really angry. Becouse you said  lie to us. If Danny Brook does not play, you have to say something about this to  people who there are in the theater This is your unforgiven mistake. After the show, w were still angry, we wanted to eat something in your theater restaurant. When we came to the restaurant, we saw that it was close. I was sure that we can visit it after the show  is writing on the advertisement. We were hungry and angry in this time. This is  too bad evening for us. We were bored to waiting. We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show. We were hungry after the show. But we couldn't eat something and we couldn't use  discount. They are your mistakes. I hope that you can understand me and you will do something about  mistakes. When you do something, I went to see your new shows. But, now, I want to ask that you could pay my money back. Thanks for reading this letter Yours faithfull  [SEP]  CHANGING LIFE When I went to school, I wrote a letter to my friends. Becouse I hadn't got a mobile-phone. Now I have got a mobile-phone and I always use it. It's fast and easy. But sometimes I miss the letters. I miss to wait  the postman every morning. Before we had a computer, I played game with my friends in our garden or in their garden. We played a lot of games during  day. When we had a computer, I started to play computer games. I didn't want to play outside games with my friends. Becouse the computer was more interesting than my friends. I use  internet now. I don't buy  newspaper. Becouse I can read my newspaper in the internet. I can buy something from  internet. for example, I send a flower to my mum in mother's day by internet order. My daily life is changing. Everthing is easy now. I can send a mail to my friend who lives in Canada. I never forget important days. Becouse I have got a data-bank. When the important day is coming, it says to me. Life is really easy. You need to learn how you can use the technology. But, sometimes I miss  past days. I miss to play in the garden, post a mail to my friends,  forget the important day. Sometimes I want to go to somewhere without technology. ",21.0

My god, I never should have told my sister this secret. This story started when I arrived to this town with  family. We come here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires. My mother suggested to come here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us. I hadn't known all of us (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) up to that day. My uncle, called Paul, offered us to stay with his family up to we could build our house. Cassually my cousin had the same age as me, sixteen, that's the reason for we started a friendly relationship. We spend all the time together. This ""friendly"" relationship was starting to make hot. I  never had a boyfriend and I felt in love with him. One day in the , he kissed me. It was wonderful. I felt that I had discovered other ways. In fact, I did. We made love...

795," Dear Miss Ryan: I received your letter about the two weeks at Camp California. I am writing back in response to your requests and because I have some questions also about those two weeks. First of all, I would rather travel in July, and if it's possible, during the first two weeks because I will be starting college at the end of the summer and therefore I have a lot of paperwork to get done. About the accomodations I would rather stay in a log cabin. I am not that much of a ""nature"" person and besides I have been feeling a little sore for the last few days and it would be better for my back than a sleeping bag. I would like to play tennis and  surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis. I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then. I couldn't say the same about surfing though I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it. And one last thing I would like to know about which kind of clothes should I take, if I have to take some money with me and if there are any expenses I have to pay at the camp. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate about writing or calling me. I will be waiting to hear from you Sincerely, Lolita A.S.  [SEP]  Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing fine, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe  last month!!! I helped Korn in a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy in a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe, you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they pleased. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even took pictures with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all.

I would like to travel  the first two weeks of July because in June I will be working and at the end of July I am planing to go to Paris to attend a course of French. I would prefer to be accomodated in  tents because I love camping but I don't mind also the second possibility. In your letter you wrote that I will I the chance to do two activities; First of all I would like to play tennis because I have been plaing for seven years, secondly I would like to attend a course of surf but I have just some elementary knowledge.

We should speak about our library that it is well furnished of several books, tape and video. After that we have to make sure that we explain how is it the relationship betwen teachers and students, showing the several time that we have been out together. In addition I think  should be reported in this video some personal opinion about the school  asking students and teachers. Finaly we should give some information also about our courses concerning tourism, buisness and computer. ",26.0

First of all, we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show which takes place from Monday 13th to Wednesday 15th. It is opened from 10:00 to 19:00 and it is for free for students. This is a great opportunity because we can know more about leisure and fashion from this city. If you allow us to go we could change the programme in this  way. Firstly, on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing by bus. Secondly, on Tuesday morning we can watch the Leisure  and Sports wear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally, on Wednesday, we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and makes up spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery. We hope you consider our suggestions  letting us know your answer. Yours faithfully  [SEP]  The home of the Future If you think in the future you could think in faster and better machines, advanced technology or  better life. All this will happen in the next 50 years, how can we be prepared to receive all these things in our homes? The next 50 years. Nowadays, our home life allow us to have more free time to spend doing leisure activities like practising sports or going out. In the close future we will be able to do nothing because everything will be done by computers and machines, ( washing-up, hovering, ironing, gardening, cooking, etc. ) The question is, will it be  better life? On the one hand, we will be able to spend more time with our family and not to be worried about anything. No more housework, no more stress, nor more illnesses; everything will be perfect. On the other hand, life will be boring, a large amount of workers will be have redundant and housewives will not have anything to do which will be extremely boring and tedious. What do you prefer? Do you enjoy doing nothing or do you really enjoy what you do? It is your desicion. ",26.00
270," London 17 June 2000 Dear Sir/Madam, I recently had a week's holiday in London, so I went to the theatre to see a musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at 'The Circle Theatre', where you are the manager. I had a terrible evening, so there were a lot of faults in the event of last Saturday: The first point, the show started at 20:15 (it was too late). The second point, the principal actor was changed. The third point was that the discounts tickets were unavailable and finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because the oven was broken and we couldn't enjoy  there after the musical show. I would be grateful if you could send a money back because it was a horrible evening for my family and it wasn't a perfect evening out. I hope to have news about you as soon as possible Yours faithfully, JUAN SAN SEBASTIAN  [SEP]  The science and technology have changed my life every day.

382," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has presented recently, and, I want you to know, it has really disappointed me. To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not come, which I found it in very bad taste,  disappointing. Moreover, the show started at a quarter past eight, forty-five minutes later than it might have been. I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because, as you may know, there were not  discounts available. It is for this reason, I think you should return me some money back. To sum up, I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after that. It was closed because its owner had decided to go on holiday. However, nobody told me. I think you would have to take it into consideration to avoid it happens again. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. If I had know it before, I would have never told her, because then, that was really important for me, but, anyway, presently, it doesn't really matter  me. By the time, Pat and me had a close relationship. I explained her everything it happened to me and vice versa. We had many points in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters. However, one day our friendship was broken down. I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to explain it everybody in our group, despite knowing that  must be a secret. When I met Caballos, my best friend, I felt embarassd and disappointed and I couldn't say anything. I was at a loss. Now I wish all of this had never happened, while I try to forget it laughing with Caballos and Pat. ",28.0
7," Dear Jane Clark, I am writing to you to give  some opinions of mine abut The International Arts Festival. It was a great idea and I had the pleasure of resting and relaxing, plus of getting some important knowledge from it. On the other hand there were some disadvantages: 1. Stars and artists wee only from six countries 2. Some concert halls were too small. So it was impossible to get tickets there. 3. I think that there were not enough plays and films. To sum up I want to tell you bout my suggestions for next year's festival. It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with  signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that  dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g.  national dancing of all the countries) to impress  audience and not to bore with the similar scenes. I hope this letter will help you in organying  Yours faithfully  [SEP]  Hello Philip, I have just got your letter. It is a pleasure for me to communicate with such a friend as you are.

One should have such marks as ,,3"", ,,4"", ,,5"" not ,,2"" which is eaqual to fail. 3. Another strict rule is not to be late for your lessons. Otherwise you are not allowed to come in. These rules are strict and certainly we have  endless number of just-so-called rules. I don't think you will be interested in them. Truely speaking I am not sure about home rules. I think that in our family everything is based on mutual understanding. We don't have old-traditioned rules or something alike .

The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch the bus number 37 which will go to  town center. From there you will walk until the college because it is easier to get there  than to get with another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from  town center. After the conference some drink and food will be available in the sport-center which is well equipped for disco-party. Our party has a special subject 'Western'. So we suggest to wear western clothes. On your last day you could go to the sport-musseum which is grateful and famous around the world or only go for a walk around Reconvillier-Park. I hope that I had answer all of your question and that the conference will be grateful. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  From: To: the group leader Subject: old Roman School. Introduction: I am writing to explain you about the location, the architecture and  the story of the old Roman school from Courtelary. I hope that you will get there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful thing to see. It is the unique old Roman school in the world. Location: Courtelary is situated in Switzerland and the school is on the top of the town's hill. This place is very important because it is there that an Emperor had growing up. Architecture: It is a typical  from this epoque with beautiful draw on the wall and first kind of writing in the sport center. The door is enormous because for them the entry was the most important. History: All began when Ogus Micius said that Roman need to go at school. They decided to build more school specially in Switzerland because the people  were considerated clever. During the Second World War all  school were demolished  only our is left. Conclusion: I gave you a lot of reason to get in this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town. ",25.00
862," 13 June 2000 Dear Ms. Ryan, I am very pleased to be the winer in your competition. I almost could not believe it when I received the letter you had sent. I have never won a prize like this. Thank you  indeed! I am working as a Mechanical Engineer for a well-known car company and I would like to travel in July because this the only month I can use my annual leave. During this exciting holiday I would prefer staying in a log cabin. The reason for this is that I have got a difficulty in sleeping in tents. When I was at the Univercity I was very keen on basket ball and I was playing in  Univercity's team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque. Also I am a quite good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to join Basketball and Swimming activities while I am at the Camp. There is something I need to ask you; I don know exactly what is California's weather lime. What kind of clothes  I need to bring with me? Also, what is the currency in California and how much money  I need to take with me? I am looking forward to your reply! Yours sincerely   [SEP]  Shopping is not always enjoyable. Novadays our shopping habits seem to be changed. I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop. Yes! There was only one shop in the area where I used to live until we moved to Oxford. I was really astonished by all these shopping centers like ASDA, HOMEBASE, ex. One day I decided to go to the shopping center which is only 40 meters from our house. Firstly, I could not find the entrance. I'd walked arround  about 15 minutes until I found the door. I realized that I'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window. When I entered into the shope I was a bit angry. I was holding a peace of paper which my mum gave to me. There were written all things I had to buy. But no way! I started looking for the food products written on the paper but I found only the eggs, milk and bread. Nothing else. So what was all that about?! I wasted 2 hours to buy food which you can find in every local shop. Later somebody told me that I had to look at the labels on the top. ",32.0
41," Dear Mrs Jane Clark, I am writing with reference to the International Arts Festival  I have recently been to and I would like to give you my opinions about it. According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there were stars and artists from around the world; but they were only from six countries. In addition to this some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there fro the occasion and, personally speaking  the show could be done at the open air next year, so that  music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around. Plays and films had a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it. The other events I went to, dance shows, art exhibitions and talk by writers, were well organised and extremely interesting. Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was  excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part to the Festival. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear George, I'm writing to answer your question about  rules in my life, at school and at home. As you may know, I attend a Liceo, which is the most difficult kind of high school in Italy. Our teachers are very strick, we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down!,,. We can't talk during lessons and we only have a en minutes break at 10.30 a.m. If we're late, we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature  to go to class. It's hard to be extremely quite for five hours but I reckon it's a good way of education. On the other side, I feel free at home. I help doing  cleaning or the washing, but I do it because I want to, not because my parents make me do it. I can go out and stay out late, I've got my car and my mobile, so that they can call me whenever they need to hear me; but above all I know they trust me and consider my an adult. Therefor I wouldn't change anything in my home life and neither in my school life. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Best wishes. ",33.00

My family decide to visit my grandmother in Orlando, because she got some problems with the swiming-pool, she ask my parents to help her in a new swiming pool building. Because  this situation I  be very busy on the first week of july, and I  apreciate  if you can give me the choice to start my ""Camp California""  from July 10th. About the Accomodation I would prefer to sleep on the tents, because I never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins. Because I seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very kind on this sport, and also I love photography because I got a great Camara. I am really looking forward to see you soon.  [SEP]  When I was a child I never like to go shopping because my Mum spend so much time on the shops that I remember  going shopping with her, was a nigthmare.

I enjoy so much fashion that my life change completely since I start to study clothes designer and I discover that fabrics,  colors, are really enjoyable. But in this days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer  and you pay  full price, on the end of the season it is half price, I find  very anfair for people who pay a lot of money on their clothes. Anyway, shopping is allways a satisfation for rich people, because they can afforded  and they don't main to spend  full price on their clothes. ",18.0
329," Dear Sir, According to the evening I have passed in your theatre, I was supposed to see ""Over the rainbow"" (as you wrote on the publicity paper). However, it was absolutely not like you described! First, there was a big late about the time. The show begun 45 minutes later than supposed! To make matter worse, we have never had the oppurtunity to see Danny Brook because, instead, there was a different actor! How can you explain that big mistake? At the top of everything, you proposed us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show. How could we visit this place, if it is not open?! You wrote so persuately that it would be our ""Perfect Evening Out""... I am really disappointed about this experience. I spent £20 - and  not as you wrote  ""discount available"". I will not make troubles but I ask you politely  my money back. I hope, you will agree and share my disappointement. I am looking forward to staying in contact with you. Sincerly yours,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future Future, Everybody ask how will our world look like. What's about the fashion in 100 years? I think we have to take in consideration our enviroment: The pollution makes more and more the atmosphere warmer. In fact, winterseason will be rare or will maybe even disappear. The ice will smellt, the weather will be warmer. People won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certenly be sinthetic, because there won't be enough place to cultivite cotton and to let grass sheeps. Community: Another very important point! Electronical community takes more and more pace in our habitual lifestyle. We  see, the objects will come smaller. So small that I can  imagine, they will be introduce (maybe like chips) in our clothes. Our feelings will be transmit electronical through our clothes to other people. I think at  internet. "" Internet on our body"".. I'm shure that is not impossible! Clothes will take a very important place in our future. They will be like a second skin. Or do you think, an icetime will come? ",13.0

I have been traveling around Jamaica for a year without any conpert due to an inclination for adventure, so I would rather you provided a tend, I don't mind. From the 10 opitions that I have to chose  I will chose two, climbing, wich I have been praticing for three years and because that I know by heart how to do it, and swimming wich I have also been doing every day in my daily rotine in Portugal. I would like to know about wich sort of close I have got to take? And I also would like to ask how much money I have got to take. I hope that  after jully won't disturb the Camp California's plans for me. Allreggards  [SEP]  School days As known, every body have to spend all the childhood and youth at the school, because  that everybody have a similar daily life such as, wake up, got to the school, study and the best, meet all the friends. A survey has been done, and the issue is, wich subjects (lessons) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables. Someone says it is maths, pratical, usefull  but the majority says it is boring, unless you're chose a job which charges all your math's knowledge  as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer. The majorite has chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, either at the Roman life style, or in the midle age, when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands. People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward  some happiness at the free time such as, party, games, and every one loves party , it should have been filmed. At all schools there is a similar daily life wich must be filmed, this is a important part of our life, wich is full of emotions in development. ",28.0
1018," Dear Mr Robertson, I'm writing to you on the name of all the students who will go to the London's trip. First of all thank you very much for your programme, it's sounds very interesting and everybody is looking forward to it.  However, we do all have a request to ask you. We saw an advertisement about the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. This show is going on all day on March 14th. As teenagers we're all very keen on fashion so it will be a great opportunity to go because in our countryside, we'll never get a chance to see a show like that. What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th. Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show. Anyway, as students we don't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it won't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students. We hope you consider our request which would be very appreciate in the class. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Why  medias are so interesting in famous people? Because of us! I know that everyone is excited about what happened to Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of The United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit to far. Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character. In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe. ",27.00
2," Dear Jane, I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea. I would like to tell you some suggestions. The stars and artist are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls. I think you should put it in the advertisement. Are there going to be more plays and films next year? I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events, and by paying  the all events ticket they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expected to find interesting. I would like you to answer my letter. I'm looking forward to hearing from you,  [SEP]  Dear John, Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams. the rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them. I am looking forward to hearing from you, ",25.00
360," Dear Sir or Madam, A few weeks ago, I went to London, and I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show, called ""Over the Rainbow."" I'm very sory to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening. First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I need some time to by the tickets, I by two tickets of £20 and when I ask for a discount, they didn't give it to me, then I keep waiting for the show to start untill 8:15 pm. Then when the show finally started I got very disappointed because, I really wanted to see Danny Brook, but instead of him there was any other actor. Lately when the show finished, I planed to go to the restorant and get some food, but I was close, because it was being repaired. I will be very thankfull if your could return  me half or some of my money, or even to make the corresponding discount. Your faithfully  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell something to her, finally everyone knew about it. But this time it was something more important that any other time. I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling me little and terrible secret to Pat, everithing started going wrong, Katrin my friend, and the one I was being bad with, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really don't know what to do, I was in love with Brett, but I love my friend too. So I decide to talk to Brett. We both decided to finish with all this stupid affair. It was difficult, but I was the best for everyone. Then I decide to talk to Katrin, I was very sory of all I have do, so I apologize with her and promise her that this will never would happen again. Now I'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the hole world. ",23.0
134," Olivier Peissaud The Manager Circle Theater Dear Sir, I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London. My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay  the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait  8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I. After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the ""perfect evening"" as written in the adverstiment. So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy  - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertisement. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Your children clothes in 100 years How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years,  clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too. So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see. I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as ""baggy"", or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that . Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view. To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy. ",36.0
950," Dear Ms Ryan, I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter. I will give you all the necessary information. I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work, my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August. I would prefer to stay in  tents rather than in  log cabins, because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different. As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming. I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me. Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money. I want to thank you for this prize, let me know if you need further information. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Bianca Botticelli  [SEP]  Dear Kim, In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working in a concert was great. You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart from the musicists and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets,  the number on them and taking the people to their seats. It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they didn't want to wait for my help; so they went around the theatre, looking for their seats and making so much noise. Sometimes I think that people never grow up, if they had been a class of children, they would have made less noise!! Anyway, it was a great experience in spite of these little problems. Now I have to go, write soon and let me know what you have been doing. Lots of love Bianca xxx ",36.0
186," Dear Sir/Madam, I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show ""Over The Rainbow."" Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided. Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late. As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have ""a perfect evening"" as it was written, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  MY LIFE AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY Here we are, in the 21st century... We live in a technologically well-developed world, having every opportunity for communication, education and entertainment. Almost everyone has televisions, computers and electronic devices. But how has modern technology changed our lives? If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: ""My electronic alarm-clock wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat in the internet..."" There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world. When I look at my life, I can understand I am dependent on the machines. My daily life is programmed up to the virtual world I created. Modern technology has changed my life completely. ",37.0
303," Dear Mister Muller, I address this letter to you because as the manager of ""The Circle Theatre"" I hold you responsible for the most disappointing evening in a theatre I had in years. I went to see the evening performance of your production of ""Over the Rainbow"" on saturday the 2nd of June. At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable. I bought one of the most expensive tickets. Although the show was scheduled to start at 19.30h, it did not begin until 20.15h. To my greatest disappointement Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement. After the show I had to find out that the theatre restaurant, that had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party. Contrary to your advertisement I had no ""perfect evening out"" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket. faithfully yours ....  [SEP]  Best detective stories of Agatha Christie That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie's ""Witness for the prosecution"". This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who inherited her whole fortune to him. He had befriended her without telling her that he was married. The accused is defended by a famous lawyer who tells his wife that a loving wife's confirmation of her husband's alibi will not convince the jury To help her husband she works out a plan: She is willing to be  witness for the prosecution and states that her husband has not been with her at the time the crime was committed. She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations. The plan works: The jury thinks that the wife is a notorious liar and her husband is found innocent. After the trial the lawyer is told that the man was indeed guilty. ",36.0
1088,"  Dear Mr Robertson, I am writing you this letter to complain about  you have organized  us for our trip to London. First of all, I would like to thank you for your activity programme. I find it really good, specially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery. But I would like you to know that on Tuesday March 14th in London, there is a show, which is free for students, about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles called The London Fashion and Leisure Show. All the clan would enjoy going  the show, because it is a great oportunity to see an exhibition as the latest fashions. We know that you have planned a very complete programme. But we would like to suggest you to move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, so that, we can go to the show on Tuesday, which lasts from 10 am to 7 pm. Thank you very much for considering our petition. I look forward receiving your reply. Yours sincerely  [SEP]   Nowadays, in our society, there are some people who, because of their work or because of their success in life, has become popular, and by now is known by everybody. But, how does fame affect to their lifestyle? Politicians, musicians or film starts are controlled all the time, since  they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do. It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV,  go to shows,  sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things can not give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world  to pay that. But obviously, if these people are all the time in the newspaper, on TV and so on,  is because, although we don't want to accept it, we love following their lifes. So now, all we should have to ask ourselves is if their damaged lifestyles is in part our fault. ",31.00
1047," Dear Mr. Robertson, I am writing to you, in the name of all the students in my class, to tell you about our wish to change the London's programme. I would also like to thank you for the good programme you made for us,  especially the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating. I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which is going to take place at the ""Central Exibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown in this occasion. We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes part only once a year and, on top of all , it is free for students. We suggest to go to the show on Tuesday afternoon instead of going shopping (thing that we can do on Wednesday afternoon, in our free time). I hope you will consider our request yours sincerely  [SEP]  I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had absolutely no choice. We had walked for three hours (my mother, my two brother and I) through the humid and noisy jungle, looking forward to reach a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family, old friends of us, used to live. The path we were walking in was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There were nor  bridge nor a canoe, the only way to cross it was  walking on an old big  trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only connection between our side and the other. My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear. Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I took all my courage,  a big deep breath, and crossed it! It was easier than I had thought!. That day, I learnt that I can do even things which, at first sight, seem impossible to be done. ",33.00
420," Dear Mr. (...), My name is ... Two weeks ago my family and I visited London. During our stay we saw a bright advertisement of your theatre and decided to see this newest and best musical show (as it was said in you advertisement). Actually. I must say that  our perfect evening wasn't out! In your ad  was said that in  main roles  would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Danny wasn't there! Instead there was a different actor whose play was disappointing. The show had to begin at 19.30, but indeed it started at 20.15 and we had to wait for 45 minutes in a great noise. Some words about  tickets: you ad noticed that discounts were available so we didn't have  money with us. When we came the administration of the theatre said that discounts are not available. Finally, when we decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show it was closed (all the staff went home because the show lasted 45 minutes longer). For all these reasons I would like you to give me at least half of my money back. With hope for a mutual agreement, Mrs. (...).  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was May, 15 - our english teacher's birthday. Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to make a surprise for her. Month ago we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it in a secret. We have been discussing for a long time what to present her. There were a lot of proposals from the students: one proposed a vase, another - a good pen (he said it would be useful for the teacher). But we decided to buy a picture, because she has always told us about art galleries with a great exitement. We have chosen the best one with a beautiful nature  in it. We also decided to arrange a party on her birthday (and it had to be a surprise too). A day before her birthday we had an English lesson, and after the lesson Pat came up to Marion and told her about our surprise. He was bad-tempered and envious and he didn't want everything to be all right, and besides he didn't like Marion. That's why he disappointed Marion and us. ",26.0
295," Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to let you know  our unbelievable experiences which we had when we went to the theatre to see the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW.' First of all, I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because of sick. It made me disappointed very much. Moreover, he made many mistakes. Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had done at a travel agency. Finally, I am going to write about the theater, the Circle Theatre. The show supposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Because of that, we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London. It was your responsibility. We would like you to pay back the fee of the show and pay us  that hotel's fee as well. I would recommend you to show that the restaurant is closed on Monday. I could not have dinner. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Fashion of the Future If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in, most of them would answer 'clothes'. In these days, new fashions have been passing by very quickly. From my point of view, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin. For example, short skirts and tops like an under-wear. I think young people would wear smaller clothes which  they look like  almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick. It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves. Next, I predict about patterns of clothes. The animal-pattern is catching up now. It might be possible that the fish-pattern come up in 100 years. However, fashion changes too fast to predict. I think fashion changes very quickly so that people are interested in those changes.

The conference will be hold in The Royal Hall, and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus. Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall. The end-of-conference party will be hold in Francescos Restaurant, just by The Royal Hall. You should wear casual clothes. About what you can do in the area for the free time you have, I would suggest you to visit The Modern Art Museum which has now a new exhibition. Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through the Spring Gardens which are beautiful in this time of the year. I hope all this information is helpful for you. Yours sincerely,  [SEP]  The Telephone: A great invention. Imagine your life without a telephone. Yes, I know, it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention. Think about the people living in the time it was invented. Must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for........ and now for us  is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to. Of course  is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family, but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies. For example, I work for a bank, and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far, and he doesn't have to come here, we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks, and that is it! What about emergencies? A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the life of many people having a heart attack. We sometimes don't realize the importance of some inventions we use in our everyday life. But think...., what would we do without them! ",35.00
915," Dear Helen RYAN, I'm the winner of the first prize in your competion and I'm writing to you to give  some information which was required for you. Your first question was about when I'd like to travel. Well, it's only possible in July because of the University's holiday (during the rest of the year I'm attending to the classes). If I can choose  accommodation I  prefer  log cabins, because when I've been in Camps , it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation. It's really difficult choose two activities from that list. Everyone are very interesting. Anyway, I think Basketball could be the right  because it's the sport that I'm practising from I was a child and photography because it's my hobby on my free time, I'm really enjoy it and I can say I'm so good in it. I was wondering which kind of clothes we need and what about money and meals, Are they provided? or can we find some places to buy it? I suppose it's everything that you need from me. Any other question don't hesitate to ask me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you, again. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE. I think shopping is a subject really up to date. I can say that nowadays  is growing up very quickly in our society like a kind of sport or hobby to waste or spend the free time. And it's creating a lot of adict people, call ""shopalcoholics"". Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for, perhaps because it is not  your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms waiting stand up for your turn. After that,  the unfriendly and sometime's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down. But never mind! the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit  because your feet are killing you and  realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.

As far as I am concerned, my exams at school will have finished up to the middle of June. To be honest, I would like to spend some days with my family, before I go to California. Therefore, it would be better to go there in July. July should be the hotest month! The best season for holidays. About the accomodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me  the holidays with my family. According on the table with the activities, I will choose singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and  very fanatic singer from  very young . I joined my choir, when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts. I would be grateful  to tell me how much money I will need with me. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,  [SEP]  Dear Kim, I am really impressed from your interest about my experience from the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and things have to deal with that. Anyway, I've enjoyed it very much! It was the best experience I've ever had in my whole life. I was trying to be with the singers all the time. It was fantastic. I wanted to touch them, as the only way to convince myself that I was with them. I didn't really have to do anything special. I should just take care of them, serving some drinks and food during the rehearshals. That's the advantage of being a volunteer. You get good experiences which you'll never forget!

According to my great experience on climbing, I prefer accommodation in log cabins because in tents we can't sleep or being well with such cold! Never the less in summer we can't resist such hot! In base of your activities option, I would say that climbing is one of my first option, as I've mentioned and I really think that photography will help me in my other adventures.

Every one think that shopping in the best way to carry off your problems and, in fact a big solution of many problem or estrés, boring, or only for distraction. But the question is: Why shopping is not always enjoyable?. For many people, shopping had always been only for one kind of elite, or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of stuff in those big malls as  distraction. Let's talk about women; nightmare! women can't resist the fact of shopping and they are dissapointed when they don't have the wants to shop. The shopmania is really unstapped. I know women that make everything they can to buy only a dress, or even worst, women that buy things that was nothing to do with them, for example, snap, esculptures, kitchen tissues, or eveything on telemarketing that really are unuseful, but the fact of have it "" there"" they can  resist There are many facts to prove that shopping is not ""pretty and armonious"", but believe me,  is not always enjoyable.

338," Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to complain about the show which I saw in your theatre. During  staying in London, I had read your advertisement and planned to enjoy seeing the musical show. I had expected that I could have spend a wonderful night. But it was completely different one  which I had expected. I had been looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Can you imagine how disappointed I was when I saw the different actors on the stage? According to the advertisement the show is to start at 19:30. However it did at 20:15. We had to wait for 45 minutes! Could you understand how boring it was just sitting with nothing to do.? You mention about discounts, too. But no discounts were accepted. In addition your theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was sick! I felt so uncomfortable and the night was not perfect at all. I insist you should refund all the money that I wasted in your theatre. Yours faithfully,   [SEP]  Modern technology has really changed our daily life. For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is  freezing morning. We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house. The housekeeping work doesn't take much time thanks to electrical equipments. And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad. Further, we can get many information as you like at a moment with  internet. In addition, we can travel to anywhere in the world within a few days. These are  advantages which modern technology has brought to us. But I must accept that there are some disadvantages caused by the technology, as well. The biggest disadvantage is pollution. In these days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern life. Air pollution by cars, Soil pollution by industrial wastes. The sea is also polluted by oil and  chemical detergent which is used at  home. Even food is polluted. All these facts mean that our modern life gives big damage to the earth. All of us must notice this fact. And we should keep our attention paid in order save our precious earth. ",31.0
971," Dear Madam I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me. First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize. Answering your questions, I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations. In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please. According to your letter I have two options of accommodation, or in tents or log cabins. I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayed in  tents in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortable, on the other hand I think that I will be able to ""survive"" in  tents. Looking to your letter, I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast  itselves, I want one  more exciting and that asks for more agility and another  more calm and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that, however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it. I have some doubts about my prize and travel. Is there a possibility that you  send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take? Is all  the travel already paid  including food and meals, or  I have to bring some money? Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping? Please answer my letter as soon as is possible. Your faithfully, GUSTAV SOARES.  [SEP]  Dear Kim, How are you? Is everything good in  USA? I'm writing to you because I had a wonderful experience last month. There was a concert of a famous band here in my city. I vish you were here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan's bus. Yes, there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back. The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00. When we entered inside of it, we saw a lot of fans using T-shirts, caps and shouting, ""Almendegos, Almendegos..."" (that is the name of the band). AT 20:00, we stopped in a coffee house to eat. The shouted: ""20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave."" We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him so much. After a few minutes (I fought  were  few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked to my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes . The man offered  a ride. We accept. You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself. When we arrived the concert had already began. When we were running to enter a man called us. He was helping to put the materials of the concerts (microphone...) on the stage. He asked if we could help. We answered: ""Yes!"" We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us. By my side the vocal of the Almendegos was and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show in the best place, near of the stage and after, the thing that I most liked, we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures. That was the best night of my life. I wish that you liked my experience. Kisses, GUSTAV. ",27.0
554," Dear Helen I am writing to thank you for the first prize in your competition and reply to your letter. First of all, according to your letter you asked me my prefered travel dates. If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to go on my holiday in July. On your letter, you are going to provid me one of tents and log cabins with accommodation at Camp California. I would like to be in tents because I can find it being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins. I am very happy because I can have a chance to do activities while I am at the camp. I would like to take part in the Golf and the sailing. I am not goot at both of them. I have been interested in them so I would like to turn up them on this chance. Finally, I would like to know something about travel. Could you let me know whether I need extra money or what sort of clothes I need. I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be the first time in the U.S.A. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Dear Kim I was happy to get your letter. I haven't writen a letter to you for ages. I'm sorry about that. On your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert. I'll tell you my experience about helping  the pop concert. At first, I applyed for the volenteer at the pop concert and then I got a responsibility for control the audience. I had to make the fan to keep  a queue. I also make them find their seats. It was very hard working. For example, I always spoke loudly and run fast. However, there was something good to me. I saw a lot of singers and entertainers. I didn't need to pay  enterence fee because I was working there. Plus, I got a authography from a popular singer. I'll give you the authography for  present. It is valuable of keeping on your suvinier. I'll tell you more  experience on  next letter. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best whishes ",20.0
1101," Dear Mr Robertson Thank you for organising the trip to London. It is very fantastic especially the programme on 13th March that we are having a river trip to Greenwich. The purpose that I am writing due to the fact that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It is worth visiting  exhibition and we would like to go there. The show is established on Tuesday March 14th at  Central Exhibition Hall London from 10.00 to 19.00. In the hall, there are four important themes; latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles. This is  great opportunity for the student to learn  the changing in fashion and leisure and it is free. I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme. We agreed all that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful. However, we would like to change the plans on Tuesday and Wednesday in the morning. On Tuesday morning, we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting  Science Museum and we will go there tomorrow morning. Visiting   National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning. That  all I would like to recommend you . It would be greatful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us about your decision as soon as possible. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  The discussion about whether or not the famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is the controversial one. There are people from both side of  agrument who have strong feelings. There is evidence that these people's life should be advertised by the media. Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them. In addition, their life may be the good example for other people to follow. Sometime, many people don't know what to do and they should the person who they admire to immitate. However, there is other disadvantages that we should consider. Firstly, the famous people would like to do anything they want  without being concentrated by  media. I think it  is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public. Eventhough, the famous people can be the good example, they should be the bad habit for public. A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, For example, buying the clothes that famous people wear. The reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life. To Prevent many people from copying too much we shouldn't inform  all aspects of  life of famous people. I agree that the famous people life should be in private. It is the benefit for themselves and the public. ",21.00
656," Dear Miss Helen Ryan, Thank you for informing me that I have won the first prize in your competition. I am writing to give you some of my information and I would like to have some further information on the camp in California. Firstly, I would like to start my journey on the second week of July because I will have a 3 weeks holiday in July. I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months. As for the accommodation I would like to stay in a log cabin because I hate sleeping in the tents. I stayed in a tent once when I had my Duke of Edinburgh walk. I felt really uncomfortable in the tent. Secondly, I would like to have a chance to do singing and swimming while I am  the Camp. I am keen on singing and I have won sevral singing competitions at school. I have chosen swimming because it is my favourite sport. I enjoy doing it very much. I note that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for, but does it include my expenses in California? Lastly, I would like to know what the weather in California  likes and which type of clothes I have to bring. Would it be possible for you to send me a map of california so I know where the camp site is situated? I would be grateful if you could send me some information. I look forward to hearing from you. Your sincerely  Annabel Koh  [SEP]  Dear Kim, Hi! How are you? How are you getting on with your school work? Do you enjoy your schoollife? As you know I had a wonderful experience in last month so I am writing to tell you . I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entred the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert was started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert. I had a really good time in this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is? I look forward to hearing from you. Your faithfully ",36.0
543," Dear Helen, I would like to thank you for the letter I have just received. First of all I would like to point out that it is a great pleasure for me to take part in your competition. I would like to assure you that I would do my best to be the one of the winners in your competition. Now, If I would like to state some of the information that you may need. Firstly, I have to say that I can travel only in July this year. This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months. Secoundly, I would be very grateful if you can accommodate me in tents rather than long cabins. It is mostly because I like fresh air at night. From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have choosen: basketball and swimming. I am very good at those kinds of sports and think that I could be the winner. Finally, I would like to ask you how many clothes and how much money should I take with me. I will wait to hearing from you, soon. Yours sincerely, Piotr Kaczmarski  [SEP]  I do agree with the opinion that shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays many young people like to do their shopping. But, isn't it a kind of entertaintment? In the first place, I would like to point out that to go shopping does not always mean to buy something. A lot of people, especially women, go to do their shopping only for fan. In such a situation they are looking for something that they might buy. But, what about real shopping. I mean shopping with a real purpose. For example, emagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate suit. It's a real nightmare when you try to match everything: from the size, the colour to the sawings of the suit that is acceptable for everyone. On the other hand it is a great achievement for you when you buy the suit that is perfect for everyone. To sum up, I would like to say that shopping is enjoyable when you are going only for fan. But, when you want to buy something special it's a real nightmare. ",23.0
534," Dear Helen Ryan: I am writing to answer to the questions I have been asked in your previous letter. I have decided I would like to visit Camp California only in July because I have already organized an other trip for the month of august. I would rather prefer sleeping in  log cabins if its possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground. I have also chosen as activities the ones of Golf and tennis. I am rather good at these sports because I have practised them since I was a little girl. I am better at tennis that at golf but anyway I have experience in both these sports. I have also several simple questions. I would like to know how much money I have to take and what type of clothes I need. Do I have to take with me my tennis raquet and my golf bag? I would be very thankful to recieve answers to my questions. thank you. yours sincerely,  [SEP]  Dear Kim: How are you? I'm fine. I finish school next week. I have to tell you all about the pop concert I helped to organize last month. it was really cool. I got the chance to meet Ricky Martin. Boy, He's really really handsom! I was in charge of the lights of the stage, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage. It was hard work because I have been practising for several weeks. I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lightened with a blue light or a green one. Even though I ended  terribly tired I really enjoyed myself. It was a strange experience because its something new for me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!! Well, its an experience I'll never forget as long as I live.

1213," Dear Mrs Maria Smith, Thank you for your letter. I am writing to answering our question. Firstly, I already have booked  Palace Hotel for the students. There is the hotel near my college. It takes five minutes to get  my college by walking. I will copy the map around the college. Secondly, I will tell you about the end-of-conference party. It will start at six o'clock. The party will be held in the dinning room. People who will attend the party are many professers, semi-professers and faculties. So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes. Finally, I will give you some ideas for an afternoon free time. The city in which there is my college is traditional in my country. For example, there are many shrines, temples, and castles. I suggest that you should visit these places. You will have a good time. In addition, there are many other colleges. You will be able to see many Japanese students. I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference. If you would like to gain more information, you will ask me everytime. Yours sincerely.  [SEP]  I suggest that you should visit one building. My town is the capital of Japan. So there are many higher buildings. I think it is like New York. However, I have only one building which I want you to visit. The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60'. This is the highest building in Tokyo. I recommend to visit . I have three reasons for my recommendation. Firstly, there is the acquerium in the building. In addition, this is the 60th floor,  I went there  first time I couldn't believed it. Secondly, if you visit there, you will see everywhere in Tokyo. The scene of Tokyo is not beautiful, but you think that this city is a developing place. On the other hand you may think what a small city it is!! Finally, there are many shops inside the building. You will have a good time for shopping. I hope when you visit, you will be favorite place. You should visit there. ",24.00
524," Mr Smith, Spending a week in London for holidays last week, I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really disappointed evening! Indeed, firstly, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15). Then, the actors (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) who were mentioned  and supposed to play weren't present. There were different actors who took the role. Thus, the musical show wasn't as good as it should have been. I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited  to see them. Furthermore, on the advertisement I got,  was written that the theatre restaurant was opened. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe spend a better evening than  at the begining  but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were indicated. As you can notice, my perfect evening I had supposed, was a nightmare; that's why I would please  you to give  my money back because I cannot tolerate such a thing!  [SEP]  From the begining of the century to now, modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier. Indeed, the modernism helps us to lead a confortable and better life than before. For example, cars, planes are a wonderful invention! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go to a city to an other one or to travel abroad. People couldn't think of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created. Human being became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands. The communication has made many progresses too. Everyone gets a television at home. ""A machine which talks and shows pictures!"" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago. Although there are new machines etc, the health makes many discoverts thanks to the searching on different diseases in order to make the population lived older. Thus, the modern technology seems to be a positive way in order to improve our daily life. ",22.0
429," Dear Sir or Madame, I am writing to you to complate about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at your theatre ""The Circle Theatre"". I am deeply disapointed with the service and the unrealiable notice, at your theartre. I've attened your shown on one of the evening, during my stay in London. In your advertisement you've mention ""Danny Brook"" would be starring and as it turned out it was a different Danny Brook. I am very disapointed by this. You also mention that your show would starts at 19.30 but to my knowleage it started at 20:15 and that is fourty-five minutes of waiting. It also mention other services would be availalde to the adicne. For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant were closed after the show, when it was mean to be open after the show acording to the advertisement but  was closed dure to the delay of the preformane. Lastly your advertisement mention clearly that this would be ""Your perfect evening out!"" but sadly it was a real waste of time for me. And I would like a refun, You have wasted my evening and money. I hope to hear from you soon. Your faithfully, (Rumgopol Rinsook).  [SEP]  For the past 100 year, fashion has change a great deal. Now a day clothes is designed to be more comfortable. You can just ""pop down the road"" and go shopping. Material and coloures of your cloths has changed since the early 1900's to 2000. Synethetic was created by scientis. Clothes are now mass producted and desing by desingers. Desingres are unique in the way but their desings are some times more, a pirce of art and not for realistic perposoe. It is hard to imageine what people would were in 100 years time, because since the 1900's clothes have reduce into smaller item and more preticle. May be it would contine reduceing in 100 years to come. Scinetis might discover a new way to make clothes more fixalde. It could be that you would carry a small round box. It would provide you with a new type of material to cover you body and you can chosse what you want to wear by pressing bottons. This would be very easy to mantage but that  mean no  shopping for girls. It would be scarly to live in the new 100 years, but it would be interesting to see what will happen. Hopefully it wouldn't be verybody walking around neaked. ",28.0
417," Dear Mr Smith, Last week I and my family had a holiday in London. At the end of a holiday we decided to go to the theatre. I insisted on going to your theatre, to the Circle Theatre, because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London. That days you presented ,,The over the Rainbow"". how you have written at the advertisement: it is the London's newest and best musical show. But I and my family had a very disappointing evening. Because, at first, at the advertisement was written that in this music show would play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it wasn't so. Danny Brook didn't play at the performance, there was another unknown actor. And he played awful, I couldn't hear him. Then at the adverstisement stood that  performance begin at 19.30. I and my family came to that time and had to wait till 20:15, because the show started only at that time. I was very nervious. What is more you wrote that discounts  available, but it was also  lie. After the show I was very disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to make me a pleasure. He suggested to have a supper in your theatre restaurant. But when we came to it, we saw that the restaurant was closed, because it was  reconstructed. But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement, if it is closed? So this evening was terriable. It broke all my impression about London. And now I requere my money back. Because of nothing what was mentioned at the advertisement I didn't get.  [SEP]  There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appear not long ago. Among them a mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different mashiens for  kitchen, mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they very simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time at the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing up dishes. They can only push on their dish mashiens and go to do something what they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in  daily life of people. Some years ago people especially students had to run to lubraries in order to find a book about something. But now they can use  Internet, where you can find any information you need. Very often I use  Internet, and I must say it is very convienient. The another  modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone. If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, of if something terriable has happened with me, I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box. I just use my mobile phone. Finally, I can say that modern technologies very help people at their works. With them people do their work more quikly and successfully. ",26.0
24," Rome 16th December 2000 Dear Jane X, I'm an italian boy who went to the International Arts Festival last November and I enjoyed most of the events I went to but given that I think that the Festival could be better next year I write  you these lines in order to make you know some observations of mine about the festival. The Festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all  the world. Furthermore, and for sure it is not your fault, some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall that was often two crowded. I hope next year plays and films will be more and that the ticket will be reasonably-priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival. Friendly  [SEP]  Rome 16th December 2000 Dear Marie, I'm going to write you about rules in my country and I have to tell you that life in school isn't too hard because even if there are many rules to follow nobody does it. It's written in the regulament that we can't leave the school during the breaks; we can't smoke near the classrooms; we had to justify our absences or late-enterings and even if you're over eighteen your parents have to justify you with the teacher. At my home every rule must be respected. Even if my parents don't look after me for all the matters like going out on nights or studying you don't have to think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends  for a Saturday night party. These are the things that I'd like to chance; I'd like to do what I really want  but I don't know if I'm really ready for this!! With love ",31.00
470," Dear Sir/Manager, During my visit to London, I had the opportunity to visit the Circle Theatre and to see 'Over the Rainbow'. To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected, as it completely contradicted to the advertisement. Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible, and disappointing. Secondly the starting time of the show was far from punctual. I had gone to the show which according to the advertisement was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15. In the advertisement, it said that discounts were available. Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be offered. According to the advertisement, the audience were free to go to the theatre restaurant after the show. However by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed. I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement  stating that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was totally the opposite. I hope you understand my disappointment. In addition, as a way of compensation, I would like to have a refund, and  justification for such a show. Yours Sincerely,  [SEP]  How has modern technology change your daily life? During these past few decades, or rather,  the 20th century, there has been a significant developement in modern technology. One of the essential developement is  the form of transportation. The invention of cars planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time. This enables us to save  great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented. This compared to the traditional bicycle is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in  small amount of time with hardly no effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less. Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances. There are many indispensable electrical appliances such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves. What changed my life most is portal computers. They are particularly useful for someone like me who travels often. Before I used computers generally, It took so much time for me to looking up words in a dictionary and looking up for information. With a computer however, all this is done in the matter of seconds. This again enables people to save time. The modern technology helps people in many ways and is indespensible. However if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and as a result, would not be able to live without them once they are gone. ",32.0
551," Dear Helen I'm very happy for winning the first prize in the competition. I think it would be a very good experience for me. I'm realy excited about it. Fist of all I'm going to give  some informations about me. Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment, in a company, and I'll only have two weeks off in the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July. I'd love to come earlier, but I realy can't because this job is very important for me, and I'll need it as a work experience, for my further studies in the University. I will also appreciate , if you would offer me accomodation in a log cabin, because of some health problems that I have, which are not allow me to leave outsid on the ground, and to be honest with you, I never liked camping. I'd also like to choose photography and painting from the list of activities, because I've studied Arts for three years, and these two are my favourite hobbies. I'd also like to ask you how much money I'll need for these two weeks, and what kind of clothes should I take with me, because I've never been to the States, and I don't know how the weather is  in California during the summer. I'm looking forward  hearing from you. Your sincerely  [SEP]  Shopping is an obsession for all of us. We all like going out to the shops, and spend hours, looking  all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us. But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you are going with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women and especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on any kind of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they are not buying anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I spent the whole morning doing nothing, except from looking at them trying  diferent clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's realy annoying. Also, you have to be careful when you go for shopping with children. Children always ask for something and they want to have all they toys which they see and that's not very enjoyable for the parents, because sometimes they spend more money, from the amount of money that they have planned.

I would like to travel on July because this is the only month  given to me by my employer. I would prefer to have a log cabin because I can not sleep in a tent (it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back).

It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes. It gives us the knowledge  usefull for many school club like the ""marathon shell"" club or the robotich club. Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer. But there are other lessons very important (like English of course!) Actually, I have a regret, there is no ethic lessons, It would show us how use our knowledge. ",23.0

I am looking forward to joining you at Camp California Yours faithfully Zacharie Gibson  [SEP]  We decided to make a short film about our school being seen and showed through the eyes of an imaginary student. It will be called ""A day in the life of the mysterious student X."" It will be shot just as if the viewers were student X, not seeing him but being him. He will have breakfast, take a shower, get dressed, etc...  So  viewers will. Student X will meet friends on his way to school and start talking with them. Actually one of us will hold the camera while another will stand next to him, as the ""voice"" of X. At school we want to show ""sights and sounds"" from all  lessons (about 5 minutes each). Student X will answer questions, speak with his classmates, even cheat at an exam! During the chemistry and biology classes, ""we"" will make experiences. Of course we will also show other activities such as PE the lunch break and the theater workshop. The main purpose is to show the ""real"" life of an unreal student. Therefore we want this film to be informative and funny as well. We expect to show our production during the graduation party. ",30.0
288," To the manager of The Circle Theatre Dear Sir/Madam Last weekend I was in London on holiday. I had looked forward to go and see ""London's newest and best musical show ""-Over the Rainbow. I must say I was rather disappointed by the experience. I am a great admirer of the actor Danny Brook, who was supposed to be starring in the musical. Surprizingly there was a complete different actor starring. Very disappointing! According to your advertisement the musical was supposed to start at 19:30. For some unknown reason it did not start until 20:15. I was looking forward to take benefit from the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available. After the show I had planned to have dinner at the Theatre Restaurant. Unfortunatly the restaurant was closed. I bought a ticket to have a ""perfect evening out"" during my holiday. Indeed it was not a perfect evening out. Therefore I think the least I can ask from you is to give me the money back for the ticket. Sven Reitgard  [SEP]  The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemingway Dear Sara I have heard that they will read ""The Old Man and the Sea"" on the radio P1 on Wednesday next week. It is a book written by Ernest Hemingway. I would really recommend you to listen to it. The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple. It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish. He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched. On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eats his catched fish pice by pice. The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons, but when he reaches port there is only  head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it. I really think you should take your time and listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week. Best regards Sven Reitgard ",34.0
440," Dear Mr. Smith My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' to the Circle theatre. Firstly I want to tell you how disappointing was that night. Everything in the advertisement for the show was wrong. The actors I saw in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. I went at 19.30 and the show didn't begin until 20:15 so I had to wait a lot and I arrived late to a meeting I had after the show. There were not discounts available for the tickets and the theatre's restaurant was closed after the show because it was too late. So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasent night. I hope you can understand me. Yours sincerely  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So in  very few days all the College knew that me and my friends were  who had crashed  headmaster's car. The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to close him in a little house, we had twenty kilometers far from the village until we could change his opinion. Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost his conscience. We put him in my car and we left him inside a closed room. When he woke up he started shouting and we had to make him calm. We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell this anybody because if he does we will hang the photos all arround the village. He accepted  and we left him  free. Everything began because he is a nasty person and he forced us to clean the college every day, for not paying a cleaning assistant. We need to do something like that to make him change. ",26.0
385," Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"", which as organised in your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was other actor instead of him, which came to me as a great disappointment. Secondly, as for the times , instead of 19.30 it all started at 20:15, which involved being stranded in the theatre for such a long time. Added to this, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. Nevertheless, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you  a full refund or at least part of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI  [SEP]  Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down. It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away. To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed. The worst point was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood. Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I determined to fall out with her. Since then, I hasen't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her since we had quarrelled was: ""It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!""
